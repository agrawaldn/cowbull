<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">First of all, let me offer my humble, respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of my spiritual master, His Divine Grace &#346;r&#299; &#346;r&#299;mad Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; Gosv&#257;m&#299; Prabhup&#257;da. Sometime in the year 1935 when His Divine Grace was staying at R&#257;dh&#257;-ku&#7751;&#7693;a, I went to see him from Bombay. At that time, he gave me many important instructions in regard to constructing temples and publishing books. He personally told me that publishing books is more important than constructing temples. Of course, those same instructions remained within my mind for many years. In 1944 I began publishing my <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead,</span> and when I retired from family life in 1958 I began publishing <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> in Delhi. When three parts of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> had been published in India, I then started for the United States of America on the thirteenth of August, 1965.</div>
</div><A NAME="96923"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">I am continuously trying to publish books, as suggested by my spiritual master. Now, in this year, 1976, I have completed the Seventh Canto of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> and a summary of the Tenth Canto has already been published as <span class="Italic">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</span> Still, the Eighth Canto, Ninth Canto, Tenth Canto, Eleventh Canto and Twelfth Canto are yet to be published. On this occasion, therefore, I am praying to my spiritual master to give me strength to finish this work. I am neither a great scholar nor a great devotee; I am simply a humble servant of my spiritual master, and to the best of my ability I am trying to please him by publishing these books, with the cooperation of my disciples in America. Fortunately, scholars all over the world are appreciating these publications. Let us cooperatively publish more and more volumes of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> just to please His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This First Chapter of the Eighth Canto may be summarized as a description of four Manus, namely Sv&#257;yambhuva, Sv&#257;roci&#7779;a, Uttama and T&#257;masa. After hearing descriptions of the dynasty of Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu until the end of the Seventh Canto, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it desired to know about other Manus. He desired to understand how the Supreme Personality of Godhead descends&mdash;not only in the past but at the present and in the future&mdash;and how He acts in various pastimes as Manu. Since Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was eager to know all this, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; gradually described all the Manus, beginning with the six Manus who had appeared in the past.</div>
</div><A NAME="96925"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The first Manu was Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu. His two daughters, namely &#256;k&#363;ti and Devah&#363;ti, gave birth to two sons, named Yaj&ntilde;a and Kapila respectively. Because &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; had already described the activities of Kapila in the Third Canto, he now described the activities of Yaj&ntilde;a. The original Manu, along with his wife, &#346;atar&#363;p&#257;, went into the forest to practice austerities on the bank of the River Sunand&#257;. They practiced austerities for a hundred years, and then Manu, in a trance, formed prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. R&#257;k&#7779;asas and <span class="Italic">asuras</span> then attempted to devour him, but Yaj&ntilde;a, accompanied by his sons the Y&#257;mas and the demigods, killed them. Then Yaj&ntilde;a personally took the post of Indra, the King of the heavenly planets.</div>
</div><A NAME="96926"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The second Manu, whose name was Sv&#257;roci&#7779;a, was the son of Agni, and His sons were headed by Dyumat, Su&#7779;e&#7751;a and Roci&#7779;mat. In the age of this Manu, Rocana became Indra, the ruler of the heavenly planets, and there were many demigods, headed by Tu&#7779;ita. There were also many saintly persons, such as &#362;rja and Stambha. Among them was Veda&#347;ir&#257;, whose wife, Tu&#7779;it&#257;, gave birth to Vibhu. Vibhu instructed eighty-eight thousand <span class="Italic">d&#7771;&#7693;ha-vratas,</span> or saintly persons, on self-control and austerity.</div>
</div><A NAME="96927"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Uttama, the son of Priyavrata, was the third Manu. Among his sons were Pavana, S&#7771;&ntilde;jaya and Yaj&ntilde;ahotra. During the reign of this Manu, the sons of Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha, headed by Pramada, became the seven saintly persons. The Satyas, Deva&#347;rutas and Bhadras became the demigods, and Satyajit became Indra. From the womb of Sun&#7771;t&#257;, the wife of Dharma, the Lord appeared as Satyasena, and He killed all the Yak&#7779;as and R&#257;k&#7779;asas who were fighting with Satyajit.</div>
</div><A NAME="96928"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">T&#257;masa, the brother of the third Manu, was the fourth Manu, and he had ten sons, including P&#7771;thu, Khy&#257;ti, Nara and Ketu. During his reign, the Satyakas, Haris, V&#299;ras and others were demigods, the seven great saints were headed by Jyotirdh&#257;ma, and Tri&#347;ikha became Indra. Harimedh&#257; begot a son named Hari in the womb of his wife Hari&#7751;&#299;. This Hari, an incarnation of God, saved the devotee Gajendra. This incident is described as <span class="Italic">gajendra-mok&#7779;a&#7751;a.</span> At the end of this chapter, Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja particularly asks about this incident.</div>

At the present time, especially in India, so many rascals are claiming to be incarnations, and people are being misled. Therefore, the identity of an incarnation should be confirmed by the descriptions of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> and by wonderful activities. As described in this verse by the word <span class="Italic">mah&#299;yasa&#7717;,</span> the activities of an incarnation are not ordinary magic or jugglery, but are wonderful activities. Thus any incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead must be supported by the statements of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra</span> and must actually perform wonderful activities. Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was eager to hear about the Manus of different ages.

It is not that because one becomes king he should unnecessarily spend money for sense gratification. As soon as kings became degraded, spending money for sense gratification, they were lost. Similarly, at the present moment, monarchy having been lost, the people have created democracy, which is also failing.

In the material condition of all living entities, there are three stages of dreaming. When the material world is awake and put in working order, this is a kind of dream, a waking dream. When the living entities go to sleep, they dream again. And when unconscious at the time of annihilation, when this material world is unmanifested, they enter another stage of dreaming. At any stage in the material world, therefore, they are all dreaming. In the spiritual world, however, everything is awake.</div>

<div class="Translation">Within this universe, the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His Supersoul feature is present everywhere, wherever there are animate or inanimate beings. Therefore, one should accept only that which is allotted to him; one should not desire to infringe upon the property of others.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Having described the situation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as transcendental, Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu, for the instruction of the sons and grandsons in his dynasty, is now describing all the property of the universe as belonging to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Manu&rsquo;s instructions are not only for his own sons and grandsons, but for all of human society. The word &ldquo;man&rdquo;&mdash;or, in Sanskrit, <span class="Italic">manu&#7779;ya</span>&mdash;has been derived from the name Manu, for all the members of human society are descendants of the original Manu. Manu is also mentioned in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexc8a8.html?g=1430">4.1</a>), where the Lord says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">ima&#7745; vivasvate yoga&#7745;<br>proktav&#257;n aham avyayam<br>vivasv&#257;n manave pr&#257;ha<br>manur ik&#7779;v&#257;kave &rsquo;brav&#299;t</div>
</div><A NAME="97067"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;I instructed this imperishable science of <span class="Italic">yoga</span> to the sun-god, Vivasv&#257;n, and Vivasv&#257;n instructed it to Manu, the father of mankind, and Manu in turn instructed it to Ik&#7779;v&#257;ku.&rdquo; Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu and Vaivasvata Manu have similar duties. Vaivasvata Manu was born of the sun-god, Vivasv&#257;n, and his son was Ik&#7779;v&#257;ku, the King of the earth. Since Manu is understood to be the original father of humanity, human society should follow his instructions.</div>
<div class="Purport">Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu instructs that whatever exists, not only in the spiritual world but even within this material world, is the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present everywhere as the Superconsciousness. As confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexc1e9.html?g=4331">13.3</a>), <span class="Italic">k&#7779;etra j&ntilde;am.</span> <span class="Italic">c&#257;pi m&#257;&#7745; viddhi sarva-k&#7779;etre&#7779;u bh&#257;rata:</span> in every field&mdash;in other words, in every body&mdash;the Supreme Lord is existing as the Supersoul. The individual soul is given a body in which to live and act according to the instructions of the Supreme Person, and therefore the Supreme Person also exists within every body. We should not think that we are independent; rather, we should understand that we are allotted a certain portion of the total property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purport">This understanding will lead to perfect communism. Communists think in terms of their own nations, but the spiritual communism instructed here is not only nationwide but universal. Nothing belongs to any nation or any individual person; everything belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the meaning of this verse. <span class="Italic">&#256;tm&#257;v&#257;syam ida&#7745; vi&#347;vam:</span> whatever exists within this universe is the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The modern communistic theory, and also the idea of the United Nations, can be reformed&mdash;indeed, rectified&mdash;by the understanding that everything belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is not a creation of our intelligence; rather, He has created us. <span class="Italic">&#256;tm&#257;v&#257;syam ida&#7745; vi&#347;vam.</span> <span class="Italic">&#298;&#347;&#257;v&#257;syam ida&#7745; sarvam.</span> This universal communism can solve all the problems of the world.</div>
<div class="Purport">One should learn from the Vedic literature that one&rsquo;s body is also not the property of the individual soul, but is given to the individual soul according to his <span class="Italic">karma.</span> <span class="Italic">Karma&#7751;&#257; daiva-netre&#7751;a jantur dehopapattaye</I> [SB </span></I><a href="indexdfd4.html?g=28200">3.31.1</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> The 8,400,000 different bodily forms are machines given to the individual soul. This is confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index0d72.html?g=5952">18.61</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">&#299;&#347;vara&#7717; sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;n&#257;&#7745;<br>h&#7771;d-de&#347;e &rsquo;rjuna ti&#7779;&#7789;hati<br>bhr&#257;mayan sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;ni<br>yantr&#257;r&#363;&#7693;h&#257;ni m&#257;yay&#257;</div>
</div><A NAME="97072"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone&rsquo;s heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy.&rdquo; The Lord, as the Supersoul, sits in everyone&rsquo;s heart and observes the various desires of the individual soul. The Lord is so merciful that He gives the living entity the opportunity to enjoy varieties of desires in suitable bodies, which are nothing but machines (<span class="Italic">yantr&#257;r&#363;&#7693;h&#257;ni m&#257;yay&#257;</span>). These machines are manufactured by the material ingredients of the external energy, and thus the living entity enjoys or suffers according to his desires. This opportunity is given by the Supersoul.</div>
<div class="Purport">Everything belongs to the Supreme, and therefore one should not usurp another&rsquo;s property. We have a tendency to manufacture many things. Especially nowadays, we are building skyscrapers and developing other material facilities. We should know, however, that the ingredients of the skyscrapers and machines cannot be manufactured by anyone but the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The whole world is nothing but a combination of the five material elements (<span class="Italic">tejo-v&#257;ri-m&#7771;d&#257;&#7745; yath&#257; vinimaya&#7717;</span>). A skyscraper is a transformation of earth, water and fire. Earth and water are combined and burnt into bricks by fire, and a skyscraper is essentially a tall construction of bricks. Although the bricks may be manufactured by man, the ingredients of the bricks are not. Of course, man, as a manufacturer, may accept a salary from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is stated here: <span class="Italic">tena tyaktena bhu&ntilde;j&#299;th&#257;&#7717;.</span> One may construct a big skyscraper, but neither the constructor, the merchant nor the worker can claim proprietorship. Proprietorship belongs to the person who has spent for the building. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has manufactured water, earth, air, fire and the sky, and one can use these and take a salary (<span class="Italic">tena tyaktena bhu&ntilde;j&#299;th&#257;&#7717;</span>). However, one cannot claim proprietorship. This is perfect communism. Our tendency to construct great buildings should be used only for constructing large and valuable temples in which to install the Deity of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then our desire for construction will be fulfilled.</div>
<div class="Purport">Since all property belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everything should be offered to the Lord, and we should take only <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da</span> (<span class="Italic">tena tyaktena bhu&ntilde;j&#299;th&#257;&#7717;</span>). We should not fight among ourselves to take more than we need. As N&#257;rada said to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">y&#257;vad bhriyeta ja&#7789;hara&#7745;<br>t&#257;vat svatva&#7745; hi dehin&#257;m<br>adhika&#7745; yo &rsquo;bhimanyeta<br>sa steno da&#7751;&#7693;am arhati</div>
</div><A NAME="97076"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;One may claim proprietorship to as much wealth as required to maintain body and soul together, but one who desires proprietorship over more than that must be considered a thief, and he deserves to be punished by the laws of nature.&rdquo; (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="index87f4-2.html?g=58924">7.14.8</a>) Of course, we need to be maintained in eating, sleeping, mating and defending (<span class="Italic">&#257;h&#257;ra-nidra-bhaya-maithuna</span>), but since the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, has provided these necessities of life for the birds and bees, why not for mankind? There is no need for economic development; everything is provided. Therefore one should understand that everything belongs to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and with this idea, one may take <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da.</span> However, if one interferes with the allotments of others, he is a thief. We should not accept more than what we actually need. Therefore, if by chance we get an abundance of money, we should always consider that it belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness we are getting sufficient money, but we should never think that the money belongs to us; it belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and should be equally distributed to the workers, the devotees. No devotee should claim that any money or property belongs to him. If one thinks that any portion of property of this huge universe belongs to anyone, he is to be considered a thief and is punishable by the laws of nature. <span class="Italic">Daiv&#299; hy e&#7779;&#257; gu&#7751;a-may&#299; mama m&#257;y&#257; duratyay&#257;:</span> no one can surpass the vigilance of material nature or hide his intentions from material nature. If human society unlawfully claims that the property of the universe, either partially or wholly, belongs to mankind, all of human society will be cursed as a society of thieves and will be punished by the laws of nature.</div>

<div class="First">Offering prayers to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; Kunt&#299;dev&#299;, the mother of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, said, <span class="Italic">alak&#7779;ya&#7745; sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;n&#257;m antar bahir avasthitam:</span> &ldquo;K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, You reside both inside and outside of everything, yet the unintelligent conditioned souls cannot see You.&rdquo; In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is said that one can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead through <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na-cak&#7779;u&#7779;a&#7717;,</span> eyes of knowledge. He who opens these eyes of knowledge is called a spiritual master. Thus we offer our prayers to the spiritual master with the following <span class="Italic">&#347;loka:</span></div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">om aj&ntilde;&#257;na-timir&#257;ndhasya<br>j&ntilde;&#257;n&#257;&ntilde;jana-&#347;al&#257;kay&#257;<br>cak&#7779;ur unm&#299;lita&#7745; yena<br>tasmai &#347;r&#299;-gurave nama&#7717;</div>
</div><A NAME="97092"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;I offer my respectful obeisances unto my spiritual master, who with the torchlight of knowledge has opened my eyes, which were blinded by the darkness of ignorance.&rdquo; (<span class="Italic">Gautam&#299;ya Tantra</span>) The <span class="Italic">guru&rsquo;s</span> task is to open the disciple&rsquo;s eyes of knowledge. When the disciple is awakened from ignorance to knowledge, he can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead everywhere because the Lord actually is everywhere. <span class="Italic">A&#7751;&#7693;&#257;ntara-stha-param&#257;&#7751;u-cay&#257;ntara-stham.</span> The Lord resides within this universe, He resides within the hearts of all living entities, and He resides even within the atom. Because we lack perfect knowledge, we cannot see God, but a little deliberation can help us to see God everywhere. This requires training. With a little deliberation, even the most degraded person can perceive the presence of God. If we take into account whose property is the vast ocean, whose property is the vast land, how the sky exists, how the numberless millions of stars and planets are set in the sky, who has made this universe and whose property it is, we should certainly come to the conclusion that there is a proprietor of everything. When we claim proprietorship over a certain piece of land, whether individually or for our families or nations, we should also consider how we became the proprietors. The land was there before our birth, before we came to the land. How did it become our property? Such deliberation will help us understand that there is a supreme proprietor of everything&mdash;the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purport">The Supreme Godhead is always awake. In the conditioned stage we forget things because we change our bodies, but because the Supreme Personality of Godhead does not change His body, He remembers past, present and future. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexc8a8.html?g=1430">4.1</a>), <span class="Italic">ima&#7745; vivasvate yoga&#7745; proktav&#257;n aham avyayam:</span> &ldquo;I spoke this science of God&mdash;<span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span>&mdash;to the sun-god at least forty million years ago.&rdquo; When Arjuna inquired from K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a how He could remember incidents that had taken place so long ago, the Lord answered that Arjuna was also present at that time. Because Arjuna is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s friend, wherever K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a goes, Arjuna goes. But the difference is that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a remembers everything, whereas the living entity like Arjuna, being a minute particle of the Supreme Lord, forgets. Therefore it is said, the Lord&rsquo;s vigilance is never diminished. This is also confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a>). <span class="Italic">Sarvasya c&#257;ha&#7745; h&#7771;di sannivi&#7779;&#7789;o matta&#7717; sm&#7771;tir j&ntilde;&#257;nam apohana&#7745; ca:</span> the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His Param&#257;tm&#257; feature is always present within the hearts of all living entities, and from Him come memory, knowledge and forgetfulness. This is also indicated in this verse by the word <span class="Italic">supar&#7751;am,</span> which means &ldquo;friend.&rdquo; In the <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;vet&#257;&#347;vatara Upani&#7779;ad</span> (4.6) it is therefore said, <span class="Italic">dv&#257; supar&#7751;a-sayuj&#257; sakh&#257;y&#257; sam&#257;na&#7745; v&#7771;k&#7779;a&#7745; pari&#7779;asvaj&#257;te:</span> two birds are sitting on the same tree as friends. One bird is eating the fruit of the tree, and the other is simply observing. This observing bird is always present as a friend to the eating bird and giving him remembrance of things he wanted to do. Thus if we take into account the Supreme Personality of Godhead in our daily affairs, we can see Him or at least perceive His presence everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purport">The words <span class="Italic">cak&#7779;ur yasya na ri&#7779;yati</span> mean that although we cannot see Him, this does not mean that He cannot see us. Nor does He die when the cosmic manifestation is annihilated. The example is given in this connection that the sunshine is present when the sun is present, but when the sun is not present, or when we cannot see the sun, this does not mean that the sun is lost. The sun is there, but we cannot see it. Similarly, although we cannot see the Supreme Personality of Godhead in our present darkness, our lack of knowledge, He is always present, seeing our activities. As the Param&#257;tm&#257;, He is the witness and adviser (<span class="Italic">upadra&#7779;&#7789;&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">anumant&#257;</span>). Therefore, by following the instructions of the spiritual master and studying authorized literatures, one can understand that God is present before us, seeing everything, although we have no eyes with which to see Him.</div>

This is spiritual existence. By chanting the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra,</span> consisting of names of the Supreme Lord, we find that the name has all the potencies of the person. The Lord&rsquo;s activities are many, and according to His activities He has many names. He appeared as the son of mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, and also as the son of mother Devak&#299;, and therefore He is named Devak&#299;-nandana and Ya&#347;od&#257;-nandana. <span class="Italic">Par&#257;sya &#347;aktir vividhaiva &#347;r&#363;yate:</span> the Lord has a multitude of energies, and therefore He acts in multifarious ways. Yet He has a particular name. The <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> recommend which names we should chant, such as Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare Hare. It is not that we have to search for some name or manufacture one. Rather, we must follow the saintly persons and the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> in chanting His holy name.</div>
<div class="Purport">Although the material and spiritual energies both belong to the Lord, He is impossible to understand as long as we are in the material energy. And when we come to the spiritual energy, He is very easy to know. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="index72c4.html?g=8235">1.7.23</a>): <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;&#7745; vyudasya cic-chakty&#257; kaivalye sthita &#257;tmani.</span> Although the external energy belongs to the Lord, when one is in the external energy (<span class="Italic">mama m&#257;y&#257; duratyay&#257;</span>) He is very difficult to understand.

Therefore in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexbf7d.html?g=5898">18.55</a>) it is said, <span class="Italic">bhakty&#257; m&#257;m abhij&#257;n&#257;ti y&#257;v&#257;n ya&#347; c&#257;smi tattvata&#7717;:</span> one who wants to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead in reality must take to the platform of <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness.

Even though the people of the world have forgotten God and may say that God is dead, this is not a fact. One can understand God when one takes to the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, and thus one can be happy.</div>

<div class="Translation">The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, works just like an ordinary human being, yet He does not desire to enjoy the fruits of work. He is full in knowledge, free from material desires and diversions, and completely independent. As the supreme teacher of human society, He teaches His own way of activities, and thus He inaugurates the real path of religion. I request everyone to follow Him.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This is the sum and substance of our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement. We are simply requesting human society to follow in the footsteps of the teacher of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> Follow the instructions of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; As It Is,</span> and your life will be successful. That is the summary of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement. The organizer of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is teaching everyone how to follow Lord R&#257;macandra, how to follow Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and how to follow &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. In this material world, we need a leader for a monarchy or good government. Lord &#346;r&#299; R&#257;macandra, by His practical example, showed how to live for the benefit of all human society. He fought with demons like R&#257;va&#7751;a, He carried out the orders of His father, and He remained the faithful husband of mother S&#299;t&#257;. Thus there is no comparison to Lord R&#257;macandra&rsquo;s acting as an ideal king. Indeed, people still hanker for <span class="Italic">r&#257;ma-r&#257;jya,</span> a government conducted like that of Lord R&#257;macandra. Similarly, although Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He taught His disciple and devotee Arjuna how to lead a life ending in going back home, back to Godhead (<span class="Italic">tyaktv&#257; deha&#7745; punar janma naiti m&#257;m eti so &rsquo;rjuna</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexe89d.html?g=1505">4.9</a>]). All teachings&mdash;political, economic, social, religious, cultural and philosophical&mdash;are to be found in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> One only has to follow them strictly. The Supreme Personality of Godhead also comes as Lord Caitanya just to play the part of a pure devotee. Thus the Lord teaches us in different ways just to make our lives successful, and Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu requests us to follow Him.</div>
<div class="Purport">Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu is the leader of mankind, and he has given a book called <span class="Italic">Manu-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> to guide human society. Herein he directs us to follow the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His different incarnations. These incarnations are described in Vedic literature, and Jayadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; has described ten important incarnations in summary (<span class="Italic">ke&#347;ava dh&#7771;ta-m&#299;na-&#347;ar&#299;ra jaya jagad-&#299;&#347;a hare, ke&#347;ava dh&#7771;ta-nara-hari-r&#363;pa jaya jagad-&#299;&#347;a hare, ke&#347;ava dh&#7771;ta-buddha-&#347;ar&#299;ra jaya jagad-&#299;&#347;a hare,</span> etc.). Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu instructs us to follow the instructions of God&rsquo;s incarnations, especially K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s instructions of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; As It Is.</span></div>

<div class="Translation">In that garden there was a very large lake filled with shining golden lotus flowers and the flowers known as kumuda, kahl&#257;ra, utpala and &#347;atapatra, which added excellent beauty to the mountain. There were also bilva, kapittha, jamb&#299;ra and bhall&#257;taka trees. Intoxicated bumblebees drank honey and hummed with the chirping of the birds, whose songs were very melodious. The lake was crowded with swans, k&#257;ra&#7751;&#7693;avas, cakr&#257;vakas, cranes, and flocks of water chickens, d&#257;ty&#363;has, koya&#7779;&#7789;is and other murmuring birds. Because of the agitating movements of the fish and tortoises, the water was decorated with pollen that had fallen from the lotus flowers. The lake was surrounded by kadamba flowers, vetasa flowers, nalas, n&#299;pas, va&ntilde;julakas, kundas, kurubakas, a&#347;okas, &#347;ir&#299;&#7779;as, k&#363;&#7789;ajas, i&#7749;gudas, kubjakas, svar&#7751;a-y&#363;th&#299;s, n&#257;gas, punn&#257;gas, j&#257;t&#299;s, mallik&#257;s, &#347;atapatras, j&#257;lak&#257;s and m&#257;dhav&#299;-lat&#257;s.

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Thereafter, because of being pulled into the water and fighting for many long years, the elephant became diminished in his mental, physical and sensual strength. The crocodile, on the contrary, being an animal of the water, increased in enthusiasm, physical strength and sensual power.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the fighting between the elephant and the crocodile, the difference was that although the elephant was extremely powerful, he was in a foreign place, in the water. During one thousand years of fighting, he could not get any food, and under the circumstances his bodily strength diminished, and because his bodily strength diminished, his mind also became weak and his senses less powerful. The crocodile, however, being an animal of the water, had no difficulties. He was getting food and was therefore getting mental strength and sensual encouragement. Thus while the elephant became reduced in strength, the crocodile became more and more powerful. Now, from this we may take the lesson that in our fight with <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> we should not be in a position in which our strength, enthusiasm and senses will be unable to fight vigorously. Our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement has actually declared war against the illusory energy, in which all the living entities are rotting in a false understanding of civilization. The soldiers in this K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement must always possess physical strength, enthusiasm and sensual power. To keep themselves fit, they must therefore place themselves in a normal condition of life. What constitutes a normal condition will not be the same for everyone, and therefore there are divisions of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama&mdash;br&#257;hma&#7751;a, k&#7779;atriya, vai&#347;ya, &#347;&#363;dra, brahmacarya, g&#7771;hastha, v&#257;naprastha</span> and <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa.</span> Especially in this age, Kali-yuga, it is advised that no one take <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa.</span></div>

For preaching we give young boys <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa,</span> but actually it is being experienced that they are not fit for <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa.</span> There is no harm, however, if one thinks that he is unfit for <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa;</span> if he is very much agitated sexually, he should go to the <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama</span> where sex is allowed, namely the <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha-&#257;&#347;rama.</span> That one has been found to be very weak in one place does not mean that he should stop fighting the crocodile of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> One should take shelter of the lotus feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, as we shall see Gajendra do, and at the same time one can be a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> if he is satisfied with sexual indulgence. There is no need to give up the fight. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu therefore recommended, <span class="Italic">sth&#257;ne sthit&#257;&#7717; &#347;ruti-gat&#257;&#7745; tanu-v&#257;n-manobhi&#7717;.</span> One may stay in whichever <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama</span> is suitable for him; it is not essential that one take <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa.</span> If one is sexually agitated, he can enter the <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha-&#257;&#347;rama.</span> But one must continue fighting. For one who is not in a transcendental position, to take <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> artificially is not a very great credit. If <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> is not suitable, one may enter the <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha-&#257;&#347;rama</span> and fight <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> with great strength.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Everyone in the material world is engaged in a struggle for existence.

<div class="First">This material world is described as <span class="Italic">pada&#7745; pada&#7745; yad vipad&#257;m,</span> which means that at every step there is danger. A fool wrongly thinks that he is happy in this material world, but in fact he is not, for one who thinks that way is only illusioned. At every step, at every moment, there is danger. In modern civilization one thinks that if he has a nice home and a nice car his life is perfect. In the Western countries, especially in America, it is very nice to possess a good car, but as soon as one is on the road, there is danger because at any moment an accident may take place and one will be killed. The record actually shows that so many people die in such accidents. Therefore if we actually think that this material world is a very happy place, this is our ignorance. Real knowledge is that this material world is full of danger. We may struggle for existence as far as our intelligence allows and may try to take care of ourselves, but unless the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, ultimately saves us from danger, our attempts will be useless. Therefore Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja says:</div>

As confirmed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, paritr&#257;&#7751;&#257;ya s&#257;dh&#363;n&#257;&#7745; vin&#257;&#347;&#257;ya ca du&#7779;k&#7771;t&#257;m:</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexb53f.html?g=1496">4.8</a>] the Lord appears in His various incarnations for two purposes&mdash;to annihilate the <span class="Italic">du&#7779;k&#7771;t&#299;,</span> the sinful, and to protect His devotees. The King of the elephants decided to surrender unto Him. This is intelligent. One must know that great Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrender unto Him. The Lord comes personally to instruct us how to be happy, and only fools and rascals do not see by intelligence this supreme authority, the Supreme Person. In the <span class="Italic">&#347;ruti-mantra</span> it is said:</div>

<div class="After-Verse">It is out of fear of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that the wind is blowing, that the sun is distributing heat and light, and that death is chasing everyone. Thus there is a supreme controller, as confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index652d.html?g=3075">9.10</a>): <span class="Italic">may&#257;dhyak&#7779;e&#7751;a prak&#7771;ti&#7717; s&#363;yate sacar&#257;caram.</span> This material manifestation is working so well because of the supreme controller. Any intelligent person, therefore, can understand that there is a supreme controller. Furthermore, the supreme controller Himself appears as Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, as Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu and as Lord R&#257;macandra to give us instructions and to show us by example how to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Yet those who are <span class="Italic">du&#7779;k&#7771;t&#299;,</span> the lowest of men, do not surrender (<span class="Italic">na m&#257;&#7745; du&#7779;k&#7771;tino m&#363;&#7693;h&#257;&#7717; prapadyante nar&#257;dham&#257;&#7717;</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index8b11.html?g=2595">7.15</a>]).</div>
<div class="Purport">In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the Lord clearly says, <span class="Italic">m&#7771;tyu&#7717; sarva-hara&#347; c&#257;ham:</span> &ldquo;I am all-devouring death.&rdquo; Thus <span class="Italic">m&#7771;tyu,</span> or death, is the representative who takes everything away from the living entity who has accepted a material body. No one can say, &ldquo;I do not fear death.&rdquo; This is a false proposition. Everyone fears death. However, one who seeks shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be saved from death. One may argue, &ldquo;Does the devotee not die?&rdquo; The answer is that a devotee certainly must give up his body, for the body is material. The difference is, however, that for one who surrenders to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a fully and who is protected by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the present body is his last; he will not again receive a material body to be subjected to death. This is assured in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexe89d.html?g=1505">4.9</a>). <span class="Italic">Tyaktv&#257; deha&#7745; punar janma naiti m&#257;m eti so&rsquo;rjuna:</span> a devotee, after giving up his body, does not accept a material body, but returns home, back to Godhead. We are always in danger because at any moment death can take place. It is not that only Gajendra, the King of the elephants, was afraid of death. Everyone should fear death because everyone is caught by the crocodile of eternal time and may die at any moment. The best course, therefore, is to seek shelter of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and be saved from the struggle for existence in this material world, in which one repeatedly takes birth and dies. To reach this understanding is the ultimate goal of life.</div>

<div class="Chapnum">3. Gajendra's Prayers of Surrender</div>
<table>
<tr><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td><td width="90%">
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">In this chapter, the prayers by Gajendra, the King of the elephants, are described. It appears that the King of the elephants was formerly a human being known as Indradyumna and that he learned a prayer to the Supreme Lord. Fortunately he remembered that prayer and began to chant it to himself. First he offered his respectful obeisances to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and because of his awkward position in having been attacked by the crocodile, he expressed his inability to recite prayers nicely. Nonetheless, he tried to chant the <span class="Italic">mantra</span> and expressed himself in appropriate words as follows.</div>
</div><A NAME="97762"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">&ldquo;The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of all causes, the original person from whom everything has emanated. He is the root cause of this cosmic manifestation, and the entire cosmos rests in Him, yet He is transcendental, for He does everything in relation to the material world through His external energy. He is eternally situated in the spiritual world&mdash;in Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha or Goloka V&#7771;nd&#257;vana&mdash;where He engages in His eternal pastimes. The material world is a product of His external energy, or material nature, which works under His direction. It is thus that creation, maintenance and annihilation take place. The Lord exists at all times. This is extremely difficult for a nondevotee to understand. Although the transcendental Supreme Personality of Godhead is perceivable by everyone, only the pure devotees perceive His presence and activities. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is completely free from material birth, death, old age and disease. Indeed, if anyone in this material world takes shelter of Him, he also becomes situated in that transcendental position. For the satisfaction of the devotee (<span class="Italic">paritr&#257;&#7751;&#257;ya s&#257;dh&#363;n&#257;m</span>), the Lord appears and exhibits His activities. His appearance, disappearance and other pastimes are not at all material. One who knows this secret can enter the kingdom of God. In the Lord, all opposing elements are adjusted. The Lord is situated in everyone&rsquo;s heart. He is the controller of everything, He is the witness of all activities, and He is the original source of all living entities. Indeed, all living entities are parts of Him, for He is the origin of Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, who is the source of the living entities within this material world. The Lord can observe the activities of our senses, which can work and achieve material results because of His mercy. Although He is the original source of everything, He is untouched by any of His by-products. In this way He is like a gold mine, which is the source of gold in ornaments and yet is different from the ornaments themselves. The Lord is worshiped by the method prescribed in the <span class="Italic">Pa&ntilde;car&#257;tras.</span> He is the source of our knowledge, and He can give us liberation. Therefore it is our duty to understand Him according to the instructions of devotees, in particular the spiritual master. Although for us the mode of goodness is covered, by following the instructions of saintly persons and the spiritual master we can be freed from material clutches.</div>
</div><A NAME="97763"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">&ldquo;The self-effulgent material form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is adored by nondevotees, His impersonal form is adored by those advanced in spiritual knowledge, and His feature as the localized Supersoul is appreciated by <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s.</span> But His original form as a person is understood only by devotees. That Supreme Personality of Godhead is competent to dissipate the darkness of the conditioned soul through His instructions in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> He is the ocean of transcendental qualities and can be understood only by liberated persons freed from the bodily concept of life. By His causeless mercy, the Lord can rescue the conditioned soul from the material clutches and enable him to return home, back to Godhead, to become His personal associate. Nonetheless, a pure devotee does not aspire to go back to Godhead; he is simply satisfied with executing his service in this material world. A pure devotee does not ask anything from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His only prayer is to be freed from the material conception of life and to be engaged in the Lord&rsquo;s transcendental loving service.&rdquo;</div>
</div><A NAME="97764"></A>
<div class="Normal-Level">In this way the King of the elephants, Gajendra, offered prayers directly to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without mistaking Him for one of the demigods. None of the demigods came to see him, not even Brahm&#257; or &#346;iva. Rather, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, seated on Garu&#7693;a, personally appeared before him. Gajendra, by lifting his trunk, offered obeisances to the Lord, and the Lord immediately pulled him from the water along with the crocodile who had captured his leg. Then the Lord killed the crocodile and thus rescued Gajendra.</div>

<div class="Translation">&#346;r&#299; &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; continued: Thereafter, the King of the elephants, Gajendra, fixed his mind in his heart with perfect intelligence and chanted a mantra which he had learned in his previous birth as Indradyumna and which he remembered by the grace of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Such remembrance is described in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexa603.html?g=2422">6.43</a>&ndash;44):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">tatra ta&#7745; buddhi-sa&#7745;yoga&#7745;<br>labhate paurva-dehikam<br>yatate ca tato bh&#363;ya&#7717;<br>sa&#7745;siddhau kuru-nandana</div>

</div><A NAME="97782"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">In these verses it is assured that even if a person engaged in devotional service falls down, he is not degraded, but is placed in a position in which he will in due course of time remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As explained later, Gajendra was formerly King Indradyumna, and somehow or other in his next life he became King of the elephants. Now Gajendra was in danger, and although he was in a body other than that of a human being, he remembered the <span class="Italic">stotra</span> he had chanted in his previous life. <span class="Italic">Yatate ca tato bh&#363;ya&#7717; sa&#7745;siddhau kuru-nandana.</span> To enable one to achieve perfection, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a gives one the chance to remember Him again. This is proved here, for although the King of the elephants, Gajendra, was put in danger, this was a chance for him to remember his previous devotional activities so that he could immediately be rescued by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purport">It is imperative, therefore, that all devotees in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness practice chanting some <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> Certainly one should chant the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> which is the <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra,</span> or great <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> and also one should practice chanting <span class="Italic">cint&#257;ma&#7751;i-prakara-sadmasu</span> or the N&#7771;si&#7745;ha <span class="Italic">strotra</span> (<span class="Italic">ito n&#7771;si&#7745;ha&#7717; parato n&#7771;si&#7745;ho yato yato y&#257;mi tato n&#7771;si&#7745;ha&#7717;</span>). Every devotee should practice in order to chant some <span class="Italic">mantra</span> perfectly so that even though he may be imperfect in spiritual consciousness in this life, in his next life he will not forget K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, even if he becomes an animal. Of course, a devotee should try to perfect his K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness in this life, for simply by understanding K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and His instructions, after giving up this body one can return home, back to Godhead. Even if there is some falldown, practice of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness never goes in vain. For example, Aj&#257;mila, in his boyhood, practiced chanting the name of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a under the direction of his father, but later, in his youth, he fell down and became a drunkard, woman-hunter, rogue and thief. Nonetheless, because of chanting the name of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a for the purpose of calling his son, whom he had named N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, he became advanced, even though he was involved in sinful activities. Therefore, we should not forget the chanting of the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra</span> under any circumstances. It will help us in the greatest danger, as we find in the life of Gajendra.</div>

<div class="Translation">The King of the elephants, Gajendra, said: I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Person, V&#257;sudeva [o&#7745; namo bhagavate v&#257;sudev&#257;ya].

He is worshipable for such exalted persons as Brahm&#257; and &#346;iva, and He has entered the heart of every living being. Let me meditate upon Him.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In this verse the words <span class="Italic">etac cid-&#257;tmakam</span> are very important. The material body certainly consists only of material elements, but when one awakens to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious understanding, the body is no longer material but spiritual. The material body is meant for sense enjoyment, whereas the spiritual body engages in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Therefore, a devotee who engages in the service of the Supreme Lord and who constantly thinks of Him should never be considered to have a material body. It is therefore enjoined, <span class="Italic">guru&#7779;u nara-mati&#7717;:</span> one should stop thinking of the spiritual master as an ordinary human being with a material body. <span class="Italic">Arcye vi&#7779;&#7751;au &#347;il&#257;-dh&#299;&#7717;:</span> everyone knows that the Deity in the temple is made of stone, but to think that the Deity is merely stone is an offense. Similarly, to think that the body of the spiritual master consists of material ingredients is offensive. Atheists think that devotees foolishly worship a stone statue as God and an ordinary man as the <span class="Italic">guru.</span> The fact is, however, that by the grace of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s omnipotence, the so-called stone statue of the Deity is directly the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the body of the spiritual master is directly spiritual. A pure devotee who is engaged in unalloyed devotional service should be understood to be situated on the transcendental platform (<span class="Italic">sa gu&#7751;&#257;n samat&#299;tyait&#257;n brahma-bh&#363;y&#257;ya kalpate</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexee26.html?g=4817">14.26</a>]). Let us therefore offer our obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by whose mercy so-called material things also become spiritual when they are engaged in spiritual activity.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">O&#7745;k&#257;ra</span> (<span class="Italic">pra&#7751;ava</span>) is the symbolic sound representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">O&#7745; tat sad iti nirde&#347;o brahma&#7751;as tri-vidha&#7717; sm&#7771;ta&#7717;:</span> the three words <span class="Italic">o&#7745; tat sat</span> immediately invoke the Supreme Person. Therefore K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says that He is <span class="Italic">o&#7745;k&#257;ra</span> in all the Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras</span> (<span class="Italic">pra&#7751;ava&#7717; sarva-vede&#7779;u</span>). The Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras</span> are pronounced beginning with <span class="Italic">o&#7745;k&#257;ra</span> to indicate immediately the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> for example, begins with the words <span class="Italic">o&#7745; namo bhagavate v&#257;sudev&#257;ya.</span> There is no difference between the Supreme Personality of Godhead, V&#257;sudeva, and <span class="Italic">o&#7745;k&#257;ra</span> (<span class="Italic">pra&#7751;ava</span>). We should be careful to understand that <span class="Italic">o&#7745;k&#257;ra</span> does not indicate anything <span class="Italic">nir&#257;k&#257;ra,</span> or formless. Indeed, this verse immediately says, <span class="Italic">o&#7745; namo bhagavate.</span> Bhagav&#257;n is a person. Thus <span class="Italic">o&#7745;k&#257;ra</span> is the representation of the Supreme Person. <span class="Italic">O&#7745;k&#257;ra</span> is not meant to be impersonal, as the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers consider it to be. This is distinctly expressed here by the word <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;&#257;ya.</span> The supreme truth addressed by <span class="Italic">o&#7745;k&#257;ra</span> is <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a,</span> the Supreme Person; He is not impersonal. Unless He is a person, how can He control the great, stalwart controllers of this universe? Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord &#346;iva are the supreme controllers of this universe, but Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is offered obeisances even by Lord &#346;iva and Lord Brahm&#257;. Therefore this verse uses the word <span class="Italic">pare&#347;&#257;ya,</span> which indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped by exalted <span class="Italic">demigods.</span> <span class="Italic">Pare&#347;&#257;ya</span> means <span class="Italic">parame&#347;vara.</span> Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord &#346;iva are <span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;varas,</span> great controllers, but Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is <span class="Italic">parame&#347;vara,</span> the supreme controller.</div>

<div class="Translation">The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no material birth, activities, name, form, qualities or faults. To fulfill the purpose for which this material world is created and destroyed, He comes in the form of a human being like Lord R&#257;ma or Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a by His original internal potency. He has immense potency, and in various forms, all free from material contamination, He acts wonderfully. He is therefore the Supreme Brahman. I offer my respects to Him.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the <span class="Italic">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">gu&#7751;&#257;&#7745;&#347; ca do&#7779;&#257;&#7745;&#347; ca mune vyat&#299;ta samasta-kaly&#257;&#7751;a-gu&#7751;&#257;tmako hi.</span> The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no material form, qualities or faults. He is spiritual and is the only reservoir of all spiritual qualities. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexb53f.html?g=1496">4.8</a>) by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, <span class="Italic">paritr&#257;&#7751;&#257;ya s&#257;dh&#363;n&#257;&#7745; vin&#257;&#347;&#257;ya ca du&#7779;k&#7771;t&#257;m.</span> The Lord&rsquo;s activities of saving the devotees and annihilating the demons are transcendental. Anyone annihilated by the Supreme Personality of Godhead gets the same result as a devotee who is protected by the Lord; both of them are transcendentally promoted. The only difference is that a devotee goes directly to the spiritual planets and becomes an associate of the Supreme Lord, whereas demons are promoted to <span class="Italic">brahmaloka,</span> the impersonal effulgence of the Lord. Both of them, however, are transcendentally promoted. The Lord&rsquo;s killing or annihilating of the demons is not exactly like the killing of this material world. Although He appears to act within the modes of material nature, He is <span class="Italic">nirgu&#7751;a,</span> above the modes of nature. His name is not material; otherwise how could one get liberation by chanting Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare R&#257;ma? The names of the Lord like R&#257;ma and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a are nondifferent from the person R&#257;ma and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Thus by chanting the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra</span> one constantly associates with R&#257;ma and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore becomes liberated. A practical example is Aj&#257;mila, who always remained transcendental to his activities simply by chanting the name N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. If this was true of Aj&#257;mila, what is to be said of the Supreme Lord? When the Lord comes to this material world, He does not become a product of matter. This is confirmed throughout <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">janma-karma ca me divyam, avaj&#257;nanti m&#257;&#7745; m&#363;&#7693;h&#257;&#7717; m&#257;nu&#7779;&#299;&#7745; tanum &#257;&#347;ritam</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexe89d.html?g=1505">4.9</a>]). Therefore, when the Supreme Personality of Godhead&mdash;R&#257;ma or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&mdash;descends to act transcendentally for our benefit, we should not consider Him an ordinary human being. When the Lord comes, He does so on the basis of His spiritual potency (<span class="Italic">sambhav&#257;my &#257;tma-m&#257;yay&#257;</I> [Bg. </I><a href="index333e.html?g=1478">4.6</a></I>]</I></span>). Because He is not forced to come by the material energy, He is always transcendental. One should not consider the Supreme Lord an ordinary human being. Material names and forms are contaminated, but spiritual name and spiritual form are transcendental.</div>

<div class="First">In the previous verses it has been described that although the Supreme Personality of Godhead has no material form, He accepts innumerable forms to favor His devotees and kill the demons.

The word <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na-ghan&#257;ya</span> is especially used here to refer to those whose knowledge has become solidified by dint of their searching for the Lord through speculative philosophical understanding. Superficial knowledge is useless for understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but when one&rsquo;s knowledge becomes extremely intense and deep, one understands V&#257;sudeva (<span class="Italic">v&#257;sudeva&#7717; sarvam iti sa mah&#257;tm&#257; sudurlabha&#7717;</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index4112.html?g=2631">7.19</a>]).

In our experience in the material world, if we have a bank balance of one million dollars, as we withdraw money from the bank the balance gradually diminishes until it becomes nil. However, the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, is so complete that although innumerable Personalities of Godhead expand from Him, He remains the same Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">P&#363;r&#7751;asya p&#363;r&#7751;am &#257;d&#257;ya p&#363;r&#7751;am ev&#257;va&#347;i&#7779;yate.</span> Therefore He is the wonderful cause. <span class="Italic">Govindam &#257;di-puru&#7779;a&#7745; tam aha&#7745; bhaj&#257;mi **.</span></div>

That is called pure devotional service.&rdquo; Unalloyed devotees have nothing to ask from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but Gajendra, the King of the elephants, was circumstantially asking for an immediate benediction because he had no other way to be rescued. Sometimes, when there is no alternative, a pure devotee, being fully dependent on the mercy of the Supreme Lord, prays for some benediction. But in such a prayer there is also regret. One who always hears and chants about the transcendental pastimes of the Lord is always situated on a platform on which he has nothing to ask in terms of material benefits. Unless one is a completely pure devotee, one cannot enjoy the transcendental bliss derived from chanting and dancing in the ecstasy of the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> movement. Such ecstasy is not possible for an ordinary devotee. Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu showed us how one can enjoy transcendental bliss simply by chanting, hearing and dancing in ecstasy. This is <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> Therefore the King of the elephants, Gajendra, said, <span class="Italic">&#257;dhy&#257;tmika-yoga-gamyam,</span> indicating that unless one is situated on this transcendental platform, one cannot approach the Supreme Lord. The benediction of being able to approach the Lord can be achieved after many, many births, yet &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu has awarded this benediction to everyone, even to the fallen souls who have no heritage of anything in spiritual life. That is actually being seen in the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement. Therefore the path of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> is the spotless process by which to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">Bhakty&#257;ham ekay&#257; gr&#257;hya&#7717;:</span> only through devotional service can one approach the Supreme Lord.

There is no need to live as an elephant or man, American or Indian; one should desire only to achieve liberation from the cycle of birth and death. Because of ignorance, we consider every life offered by nature to be happy and pleasing, but in the degraded life within this material world, from the life of Lord Brahm&#257; down to that of an ant, no one can actually be happy. We are making so many plans to live happily, but there cannot be any happiness in this material world, however we may try to make a permanent settlement in this life or that.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">&#346;r&#299; &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; continued: When the King of the elephants was describing the supreme authority, without mentioning any particular person, he did not invoke the demigods, headed by Lord Brahm&#257;, Lord &#346;iva, Indra and Candra. Thus none of them approached him. However, because Lord Hari is the Supersoul, Puru&#7779;ottama, the Personality of Godhead, He appeared before Gajendra.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">From the description of Gajendra, he apparently was aiming at the supreme authority although he did not know who the supreme authority is. He conjectured, &ldquo;There is a supreme authority who is above everything.&rdquo; Under the circumstances, the Lord&rsquo;s various expansions, such as Lord Brahm&#257;, Lord &#346;iva, Candra and Indra, all thought, &ldquo;Gajendra is not asking our help. He is asking the help of the Supreme, who is above all of us.&rdquo; As Gajendra has described, the Supreme Lord has various parts and parcels, including the demigods, human beings and animals, all covered by separate forms. Although the demigods are in charge of maintaining different aspects of the universe, Gajendra thought that they were unable to rescue him. <span class="Italic">Hari&#7745; vin&#257; naiva m&#7771;ti&#7745; taranti:</span> no one can rescue anyone from the dangers of birth, death, old age and disease. It is only the Supreme Personality of Godhead who can rescue one from the dangers of material existence. Therefore an intelligent person, to get free from this dangerous existence, approaches the Supreme Personality of Godhead, not any demigod. As confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexda67.html?g=2640">7.20</a>), <span class="Italic">k&#257;mais tais tair h&#7771;ta j&ntilde;&#257;n&#257;&#7717; prapadyante &rsquo;nya-devat&#257;&#7717;:</span> those who are unintelligent approach the various demigods for temporary material benefits. Actually, however, these demigods cannot rescue the living entity from the dangers of material existence. Like other living entities, the demigods are merely external parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead&rsquo;s transcendental body. As stated in the Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras, sa &#257;tma-a&#7749;g&#257;ny any&#257; devat&#257;&#7717;.</span> Within the body is the <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;,</span> the soul, whereas the various parts of the body like the hands and legs are external. Similarly, the <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;</span> of the entire cosmic manifestation is N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and all the demigods, human beings and other living entities are parts of His body.</div>
<div class="Purport">It may also be concluded that since a tree lives on the strength of its root and when the root is nourished with water all the parts of the tree are nourished, one should worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the original root of everything. Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead is very difficult to approach, He is very near to us because He lives within our hearts. As soon as the Lord understands that one is seeking His favor by fully surrendering, naturally He immediately takes action. Therefore although the demigods did not come to the aid of Gajendra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead immediately appeared before him because of his fervent prayer. This does not mean that the demigods were angry with Gajendra, for actually when Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is worshiped, all the other demigods are also worshiped. <span class="Italic">Yasmin tu&#7779;&#7789;e jagat tu&#7779;&#7789;am:</span> if the Supreme Personality of Godhead is satisfied, everyone is satisfied.</div>

<div class="Translation">Gajendra had been forcefully captured by the crocodile in the water and was feeling acute pain, but when he saw that N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, wielding His disc, was coming in the sky on the back of Garu&#7693;a, he immediately took a lotus flower in his trunk, and with great difficulty due to his painful condition, he uttered the following words: &ldquo;O my Lord, N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, master of the universe, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The King of the elephants was so very eager to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead that when he saw the Lord coming in the sky, with great pain and in a feeble voice he offered respect to the Lord. A devotee does not consider a dangerous position to be dangerous, for in such a dangerous position he can fervently pray to the Lord in great ecstasy. Thus a devotee regards danger as a good opportunity. <span class="Italic">Tat te&rsquo;nukamp&#257;&#7745; susam&#299;k&#7779;am&#257;&#7751;a&#7717;.</span> When a devotee is in great danger, he sees that danger to be the great mercy of the Lord because it is an opportunity to think of the Lord very sincerely and with undiverted attention. <span class="Italic">Tat te &rsquo;nukamp&#257;&#7745; susam&#299;k&#7779;am&#257;&#7751;o bhu&ntilde;j&#257;na ev&#257;tma-k&#7771;ta&#7745; vip&#257;kam</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> 10.14.8). He does not accuse the Supreme Personality of Godhead for having let His devotee fall into such a dangerous condition. Rather, he considers that dangerous condition to be due to his past misdeeds and takes it as an opportunity to pray to the Lord and offer thanks for having been given such an opportunity. When a devotee lives in this way, his salvation&mdash;his going back home, back to Godhead&mdash;is guaranteed. We can see this to be true from the example of Gajendra, who anxiously prayed to the Lord and thus received an immediate chance to return home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">There was a king on the Gandharva planet whose name was H&#363;h&#363;. Once this King H&#363;h&#363; was enjoying with women in the water, and while enjoying he pulled the leg of Devala &#7770;&#7779;i, who was also taking a bath in the water. Upon this, the sage became very angry and immediately cursed him to become a crocodile. King H&#363;h&#363; was very sorry when cursed in that way, and he begged pardon from the sage, who in compassion gave him the benediction that he would be freed when Gajendra was delivered by the Personality of Godhead. Thus the crocodile was delivered when killed by N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a.</div>
</div><A NAME="98253"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">When Gajendra, by the mercy of the Lord, became one of the Lord&rsquo;s associates in Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha, he got four hands. This achievement is called <span class="Italic">s&#257;r&#363;pya-mukti,</span> or the liberation of receiving a spiritual body exactly like that of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. Gajendra, in his previous birth, had been a great devotee of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. His name was Indradyumna, and he was the King of the T&#257;mila country. Following the Vedic principles, this King retired from family life and constructed a small cottage in the Malay&#257;cala Hills, where he always worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead in silence. Agastya &#7770;&#7779;i, along with many disciples, once approached King Indradyumna&rsquo;s <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama,</span> but because the King was meditating on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he could not receive Agastya &#7770;&#7779;i properly. Thus the <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;i</span> became very angry and cursed the King to become a dull elephant. In accordance with this curse, the King was born as an elephant, and he forgot all about his previous activities in devotional service. Nonetheless, in his birth as an elephant, when he was dangerously attacked by the crocodile, he remembered his past life in devotional service and remembered a prayer he had learned in that life. Because of this prayer, he again received the mercy of the Lord. Thus he was immediately delivered, and he became one of the Lord&rsquo;s four-handed associates.</div>

<div class="First">It is evident from this chapter that great sages like Devala &#7770;&#7779;i, N&#257;rada Muni and Agastya Muni will sometimes curse someone. The curse of such a personality, however, is in fact a benediction. Both the crocodile, who had been a Gandharva in his previous life, and Gajendra, who had been a king named Indradyumna, were cursed, but both of them benefited. Indradyumna, in his birth as an elephant, attained salvation and became a personal associate of the Lord in Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha, and the crocodile regained his status as a Gandharva. We find evidence in many places that the curse of a great saint or devotee is not a curse but a benediction.</div>

<div class="First">The story of how the Gandharva had become a crocodile will be described later. The curse by which the Gandharva took this position was actually a blessing, not a curse. One should not be displeased when a saintly person curses someone, for his curse, indirectly, is a blessing. The Gandharva had the mentality of an inhabitant of the celestial planetary system, and for him to become an associate of the Supreme Lord would have taken millions of long years. However, because he was cursed by Devala &#7770;&#7779;i, he became a crocodile and in only one life was fortunate enough to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face and be promoted to the spiritual world to become one of the Lord&rsquo;s associates.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This is the unique position of a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although the King was cursed, he welcomed the curse because a devotee is always aware that nothing can happen without the desire of the Supreme Lord.

This is a practical example of how a devotee thinks. He regards any reverses in life as blessings of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, instead of being agitated by such reverses, he continues his activities of devotional service, and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a takes care of him and enables him to be promoted to the spiritual world, back to Godhead. If a devotee has to suffer the reactions of his past misdeeds, the Supreme Lord arranges for him to be given only a token of these reactions, and very soon he is freed from all the reactions of material contamination. One should therefore adhere to devotional service, and the Lord Himself will very soon see to one&rsquo;s promotion to the spiritual world. A devotee should not be disturbed by unfortunate circumstances, but must continue his regular program, depending on the Lord for everything. The word <span class="Italic">upadh&#257;rayan,</span> &ldquo;considering,&rdquo; is very significant in this verse. This word indicates that a devotee knows what is what; he understands what is happening in material, conditional life.</div>

The word <span class="Italic">d&#257;ya-bh&#257;k</span> refers to a hereditary right to the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. A devotee must simply engage in devotional service, not caring about material situations. Then he automatically becomes a rightful candidate for promotion to Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka. The devotee who renders unalloyed service to the Lord gets the right to be promoted to Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka, just as a son inherits the property of his father.</div>
<div class="Purport">When a devotee gets liberation, he becomes free from material contamination and engages as a servant of the Lord.

Thus he comes down to open hospitals and educational institutions, feed poor men and perform similar materialistic activities, which the impersonalist thinks are more precious than serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">An&#257;d&#7771;ta-yu&#7779;mad-a&#7749;ghraya&#7717;.</span> The impersonalists do not think that the service of the Lord is more valuable than serving the poor man or starting a school or hospital. Although they say <span class="Italic">brahma satya&#7745; jagan mithy&#257;</span>&mdash;&ldquo;Brahman is real, and the material world is false&rdquo;&mdash;they are nonetheless very eager to serve the false material world and neglect the service of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Every verse in the Vedic literature, especially in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> and <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> is a Vedic <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> Here the words <span class="Italic">yath&#257;nuk&#299;rtayanti</span> are used to recommend that this literature be presented as it is. Unscrupulous persons, however, deviate from the actual narration and interpret the text in their own way with grammatical jugglery. Such deviations are to be avoided. This is a Vedic injunction supported by &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, one of the <span class="Italic">mah&#257;janas,</span> or authorities. He says, <span class="Italic">yath&#257;nuk&#299;rtayanti:</span> one should recite the <span class="Italic">mantra</span> as it is, without deviation, for then one will be eligible to rise to the platform of all good fortune. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; especially recommends that those who are <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> (<span class="Italic">&#347;ucaya&#7717;</span>) recite all these <span class="Italic">mantras</span> after rising from bed in the morning.</div>
<div class="Purport">Because of sinful activities, at night we have bad dreams, which are very troublesome. Indeed, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira was obliged to see hell because of a slight deviation from devotional service to the Lord. Therefore, <span class="Italic">du&#7717;svapna</span>&mdash;bad dreams&mdash;occur because of sinful activities. A devotee sometimes accepts a sinful person as his disciple, and to counteract the sinful reactions he accepts from the disciple, he has to see a bad dream. Nonetheless, the spiritual master is so kind that in spite of having bad dreams due to the sinful disciple, he accepts this troublesome business for the deliverance of the victims of Kali-yuga. After initiation, therefore, a disciple should be extremely careful not to commit again any sinful act that might cause difficulties for himself and the spiritual master. Before the Deity, before the fire, before the spiritual master and before the Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas, the honest disciple promises to refrain from all sinful activity. Therefore he must not again commit sinful acts and thus create a troublesome situation.</div>

<div class="First">The Lord&rsquo;s glorious activities referred to in this connection took place after His personal bodyguards Jaya and Vijaya became Daityas, having been cursed by the great sages Sanaka, San&#257;tana, Sanat-kum&#257;ra and Sanandana. Jaya, as Hira&#7751;y&#257;k&#7779;a, had to fight with Var&#257;hadeva, and that same Var&#257;hadeva is mentioned in regard to the Raivata millennium. The fighting, however, took place during the reign of the first Manu, Sv&#257;yambhuva. Therefore according to some authorities there are two Var&#257;has. According to others, however, Var&#257;ha appeared during the regime of Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu and stayed in the water until that of Raivata Manu. Some may doubt that this could be possible, but the answer is that everything is possible. If one could count the atoms within the universe, one could count the qualities of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. But the atoms of the universe are impossible for anyone to count, and similarly no one can count the transcendental qualities of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation">&#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; said: When the asuras, with their serpent weapons, severely attacked the demigods in a fight, many of the demigods fell and lost their lives. Indeed, they could not be revived. At that time, O King, the demigods had been cursed by Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni, the three worlds were poverty-stricken, and therefore ritualistic ceremonies could not be performed. The effects of this were very serious.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">It is described that while Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni was passing on the road, he saw Indra on the back of his elephant and was pleased to offer Indra a garland from his own neck. Indra, however, being too puffed up, took the garland, and without respect for Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni, he placed it on the trunk of his carrier elephant. The elephant, being an animal, could not understand the value of the garland, and thus the elephant threw the garland between its legs and smashed it. Seeing this insulting behavior, Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni immediately cursed Indra to be poverty-stricken, bereft of all material opulence. Thus the demigods, afflicted on one side by the fighting demons and on the other by the curse of Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni, lost all the material opulences in the three worlds.</div>
<div class="Purport">To be extremely opulent in materialistic advancement is sometimes very risky. The materially opulent person does not care about anyone, and thus he commits offenses to great personalities, such as devotees and great saints. This is the way of material opulence. As described by &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, <span class="Italic">dhana-durmad&#257;ndha:</span> too much wealth makes one blind. This happens even to Indra in his heavenly kingdom, and what to speak of others in this material world? When one is materially opulent, he should learn to be sober and well-behaved toward Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas and saintly persons; otherwise he will fall down.</div>

<div class="First">After hearing from the demigods the real situation, Lord Brahm&#257; was very much concerned because the demons were unnecessarily so powerful. When demons become powerful, the entire world is placed in an awkward position because demons are simply interested in their own sense gratification and not in the welfare of the world. Demigods or devotees, however, are concerned with the welfare of all living beings. &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299;, for example, left his ministership and went to V&#7771;nd&#257;vana for the benefit of the entire world (<span class="Italic">lok&#257;n&#257;&#7745; hita-k&#257;ri&#7751;au</span>).

<div class="Translation">For the Supreme Personality of Godhead there is no one to be killed, no one to be protected, no one to be neglected and no one to be worshiped. Nonetheless, for the sake of creation, maintenance and annihilation according to time, He accepts different forms as incarnations either in the mode of goodness, the mode of passion or the mode of ignorance.</div>

<div class="First">This verse explains that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is equal to everyone. This is confirmed by the Lord Himself in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index90b5.html?g=3246">9.29</a>):</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him.&rdquo; Although the Lord is impartial, He gives special attention to His devotees. Therefore the Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexb53f.html?g=1496">4.8</a>):</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I advent Myself millennium after millennium.&rdquo; The Lord has nothing to do with anyone&rsquo;s protection or destruction, but for the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this material world He apparently has to act either in goodness, in passion or in darkness. Actually, however, He is unaffected by these modes of material nature. He is the Supreme Lord of everyone. As a king sometimes punishes or rewards someone to maintain law and order, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although having nothing to do with the activities of this material world, sometimes appears as various incarnations according to the time, place and object.</div>

<div class="Translation">Now is the time to invoke the mode of goodness of the living entities who have accepted material bodies. The mode of goodness is meant to establish the Supreme Lord&rsquo;s rule, which will maintain the existence of the creation. Therefore, this is the opportune moment to take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because He is naturally very kind and dear to the demigods, He will certainly bestow good fortune upon us.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The material world is conducted by the three modes of nature, namely <span class="Italic">sattva-gu&#7751;a, rajo-gu&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">tamo-gu&#7751;a.</span> By <span class="Italic">rajo-gu&#7751;a</span> everything material is created, by <span class="Italic">sattva-gu&#7751;a</span> everything material is maintained properly, and by <span class="Italic">tamo-gu&#7751;a,</span> when the creation is improperly situated, everything is destroyed.</div>
<div class="Purport">From this verse we can understand the situation of Kali-yuga, through which we are now passing. Just before the beginning of Kali-yuga&mdash;or, in other words, at the end of Dv&#257;para-yuga&mdash;Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appeared and left His instructions in the form of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> in which He asked all living entities to surrender unto Him. Since the beginning of Kali-yuga, however, people have practically been unable to surrender to the lotus feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and therefore, after some five thousand years, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a came again as &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu just to teach the entire world how to surrender unto Him, unto &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and thus be purified.</div>
<div class="Purport">Surrendering unto the lotus feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a means achieving complete purification. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index3a32.html?g=5997">18.66</a>):</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.&rdquo; Thus as soon as one surrenders unto the lotus feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, one certainly becomes free from all contamination.</div>
<div class="Purport">Kali-yuga is full of contamination. This is described in the <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (12.3.51):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">kaler do&#7779;a-nidhe r&#257;jann<br>asti hy eko mah&#257;n gu&#7751;a&#7717;<br>k&#299;rtan&#257;d eva k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;asya<br>mukta-sa&#7749;ga&#7717; para&#7745; vrajet</div>
</div><A NAME="98800"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">This age of Kali is full of unlimited faults. Indeed, it is just like an ocean of faults (<span class="Italic">do&#7779;a-nidhi</span>). But there is one chance, one opportunity. <span class="Italic">K&#299;rtan&#257;d eva k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;asya mukta-sa&#7749;ga&#7717; para&#7745; vrajet:</span> simply by chanting the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> one can be freed from the contamination of Kali-yuga and, in his original spiritual body, can return home, back to Godhead. This is the opportunity of Kali-yuga.</div>
<div class="Purport">When K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appeared, He gave His orders, and when K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself appeared as a devotee, as &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, He showed us the path by which to cross the ocean of Kali-yuga. That is the path of the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a movement. When &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu appeared, He ushered in the era for the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> movement. It is also said that for ten thousand years this era will continue. This means that simply by accepting the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> movement and chanting the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra,</span> the fallen souls of this Kali-yuga will be delivered. After the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra, at which <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> was spoken, Kali-yuga continues for 432,000 years, of which only 5,000 years have passed. Thus there is still a balance of 427,000 years to come. Of these 427,000 years, the 10,000 years of the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> movement inaugurated by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu 500 years ago provide the opportunity for the fallen souls of Kali-yuga to take to the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, chant the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra</span> and thus be delivered from the clutches of material existence and return home, back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purport">Chanting of the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra</span> is potent always, but it is especially potent in this age of Kali. Therefore &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, while instructing Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, stressed this chanting of the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra.</span></div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">kaler do&#7779;a-nidhe r&#257;jann<br>asti hy eko mah&#257;n gu&#7751;a&#7717;<br>k&#299;rtan&#257;d eva k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;asya<br>mukta-sa&#7749;ga&#7717; para&#7745; vrajet</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;My dear King, although Kali-yuga is full of faults, there is still one good quality about this age. It is that simply by chanting the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra,</span> one can become free from material bondage and be promoted to the transcendental kingdom.&rdquo; (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> 12.3.51) Those who have accepted the task of spreading the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra</span> in full K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness should take this opportunity to deliver people very easily from the clutches of material existence. Our duty, therefore, is to follow the instructions of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu and preach the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement all over the world very sincerely. This is the best welfare activity for the peace and prosperity of human society.</div>
<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu&rsquo;s movement consists of spreading <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana.</span> <span class="Italic">Para&#7745; vijayate &#347;r&#299;-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-sa&#7749;k&#299;rtanam:</span> &ldquo;All glories to the &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana!</span>&rdquo; Why is it so glorious? This has also been explained by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. <span class="Italic">Ceto-darpa&#7751;a-m&#257;rjanam:</I> [Cc. Antya </I><a href="index0860.html?g=154712">20.12</a></I>]</span></I> by the chanting of the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra,</span> one&rsquo;s heart is cleansed. The whole difficulty is that in this age of Kali there is no <span class="Italic">sattva-gu&#7751;a</span> and no clearance of the heart, and therefore people are making the mistake of identifying with their bodies. Even the big philosophers and scientists with whom we deal are practically all under the impression that they are their bodies. The other day we were discussing a prominent philosopher, Thomas Huxley, who was proud of being an Englishman. This means that he was in the bodily conception of life. Everywhere we find this same misunderstanding. As soon as one is in the bodily conception of life, one is nothing but an animal like a cat or a dog (<span class="Italic">sa eva go-khara&#7717;</I> [SB </span></I>10.84.13]). Thus the most dangerous of the dirty things within our hearts is this misidentification of the body as the self. Under the influence of this misunderstanding, one thinks, &ldquo;I am this body. I am an Englishman. I am an Indian. I am an American. I am Hindu. I am Muslim.&rdquo; This misconception is the strongest impediment, and it must be removed. That is the instruction of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. Indeed, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> begins with this instruction:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">dehino &rsquo;smin yath&#257; dehe<br>kaum&#257;ra&#7745; yauvana&#7745; jar&#257;<br>tath&#257; deh&#257;ntara-pr&#257;ptir<br>dh&#299;ras tatra na muhyati</div>
</div><A NAME="98807"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.&rdquo; (Bg. <a href="indexf962.html?g=502">2.13</a>) Although the soul is within the body, nevertheless, because of misunderstanding and animal propensities one accepts the body as the self. Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu therefore says, <span class="Italic">ceto-darpa&#7751;a-m&#257;rjanam</I> [Cc. Antya </I><a href="index0860.html?g=154712">20.12</a></I>]</I>.</span> To cleanse the core of the heart, which is full of misunderstanding, is possible only through <span class="Italic">&#347;r&#299;-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana.</span> The leaders of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement should very seriously take this opportunity to be kind to the fallen souls by delivering them from the misunderstanding of materialistic life.</div>
<div class="Purport">One cannot be happy in any way within this material world. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexa520.html?g=2877">8.16</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">&#257;brahma-bhuvan&#257;l lok&#257;&#7717;<br>punar &#257;vartino &rsquo;rjuna</div>
</div><A NAME="98810"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;From the highest planet in this material world down to the lowest, all are places of misery wherein repeated birth and death take place.&rdquo; Therefore, not to speak of going to the moon, even if one is promoted to the highest planetary system, Brahmaloka, there cannot be any happiness in this material world. If one actually wants happiness, one must go to the spiritual world. The material world is characterized by a struggle for existence, and survival of the fittest is a well-known principle, but the poor souls of this material world do not know what is survival and who is fit. Survival does not mean that one should die; survival means that one should not die, but should enjoy an everlastingly blissful life of knowledge. This is survival. The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is meant to make every person fit for survival. Indeed, it is meant to stop the struggle for existence. The <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> and <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> give definite directions on how to stop the struggle for existence and how to survive in eternal life. The <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> movement, therefore, is a great opportunity. Simply by hearing <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and chanting the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra,</span> one becomes completely purified. Thus the struggle for existence ceases, and one goes back home, back to Godhead.</div>

Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it is specifically addressed as <span class="Italic">arindama</span> because in his political life he was able to subdue all kinds of enemies, and even though he was a young king, as soon as he heard that he was going to die within seven days, he immediately left his kingdom. He did not follow the dictates of enemies within his body, such as lust, greed and anger. He was not at all angry with the <span class="Italic">muni&rsquo;s</span> son who had cursed him. Rather, he accepted the curse and prepared for his death in the association of &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;. Death is inevitable; no one can surpass the force of death.

<div class="Translation">There [at &#346;vetadv&#299;pa], Lord Brahm&#257; offered prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even though he had never seen the Supreme Lord. Simply because Lord Brahm&#257; had heard about the Supreme Personality of Godhead from Vedic literature, with a fixed mind he offered the Lord prayers as written or approved by Vedic literature.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">It is said that when Brahm&#257; and the other demigods go to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead in &#346;vetadv&#299;pa, they cannot directly see Him, but their prayers are heard by the Lord, and the needful action is taken. This we have seen in many instances. The word <span class="Italic">&#347;ruta-p&#363;rv&#257;ya</span> is significant. We get experience by directly seeing or by hearing. If it is not possible to see someone directly, we can hear about him from authentic sources. Sometimes people ask whether we can show them God. This is ludicrous. It is not necessary for one to see God before he can accept God. Our sensory perception is always incomplete. Therefore, even if we see God, we may not be able to understand Him. When K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was on earth, many, many people saw Him but could not understand that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">Avaj&#257;nanti m&#257;&#7745; m&#363;&#7693;h&#257; m&#257;nu&#7779;&#299;&#7745; tanum &#257;&#347;ritam</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexa12b.html?g=3084">9.11</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> Even though the rascals and fools saw K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a personally, they could not understand that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even upon seeing God personally, one who is unfortunate cannot understand Him. Therefore we have to hear about God, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, from the authentic Vedic literature and from persons who understand the Vedic version properly. Even though Brahm&#257; had not seen the Supreme Personality of Godhead before, he was confident that the Lord was there in &#346;vetadv&#299;pa. Thus he took the opportunity to go there and offer prayers to the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purport">These prayers were not ordinary concocted prayers. Prayers must be approved by Vedic literature, as indicated in this verse by the words <span class="Italic">daiv&#299;bhir g&#299;rbhi&#7717;.</span> In our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement we do not allow any song that has not been approved or sung by bona fide devotees. We cannot allow cinema songs to be sung in the temple. We generally sing two songs. One is <span class="Italic">&#347;r&#299;-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-caitanya prabhu nity&#257;nanda &#347;r&#299;-advaita gad&#257;dhara &#347;r&#299;v&#257;s&#257;di-gaura-bhakta-v&#7771;nda.</span> This is bona fide. It is always mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta,</span> and it is accepted by the <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas.</span> The other, of course, is the <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra</span>&mdash;Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare Hare/ Hare R&#257;ma, Hare R&#257;ma, R&#257;ma R&#257;ma, Hare Hare. We may also sing the songs of Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura, Bhaktivinoda &#7788;h&#257;kura and Locana d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura, but these two songs&mdash;<span class="Italic">&ldquo;&#347;r&#299;-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-caitanya</span>&rdquo; and the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra</span>&mdash;are sufficient to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although we cannot see Him. Seeing the Lord is not as important as appreciating Him from the authentic literature or the authentic statements of authorized persons.</div>

<div class="Translation">Lord Brahm&#257; said: O Supreme Lord, O changeless, unlimited supreme truth. You are the origin of everything. Being all-pervading, You are in everyone&rsquo;s heart and also in the atom. You have no material qualities. Indeed, You are inconceivable. The mind cannot catch You by speculation, and words fail to describe You. You are the supreme master of everyone, and therefore You are worshipable for everyone. We offer our respectful obeisances unto You.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not anything of material creation. Everything material must change from one form to another&mdash;for example, from earth to earthen pot and from earthen pot to earth again. All our creations are temporary, impermanent. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, is eternal, and similarly the living entities, who are parts of Him, are also eternal (<span class="Italic">mamaiv&#257;&#7745;&#347;o j&#299;va-loke j&#299;va-bh&#363;ta&#7717; san&#257;tana&#7717;</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index6669.html?g=4886">15.7</a></I><span class="Italic">]</I></span>). The Supreme Personality of Godhead is <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana,</span> eternal, and the individual living entities are also eternal. The difference is that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, or God, is the supreme eternal, whereas the individual souls are minute, fragmental eternals. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexc1e9.html?g=4331">13.3</a>), <span class="Italic">k&#7779;etraj&ntilde;a&#7745; c&#257;pi m&#257;&#7745; viddhi sarva-k&#7779;etre&#7779;u bh&#257;rata.</span> Although the Lord is a living being and the individual souls are living beings, the Supreme Lord, unlike the individual souls, is <span class="Italic">vibhu,</span> all-pervading, and <span class="Italic">ananta,</span> unlimited. The Lord is the cause of everything. The living entities are innumerable, but the Lord is one. No one is greater than Him, and no one is equal to Him. Thus the Lord is the supreme worshipable object, as understood from the Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras</span> (<span class="Italic">na tat-sama&#347; c&#257;bhyadhika&#347; ca d&#7771;&#347;yate</span>). The Lord is supreme because no one can evaluate Him by mental speculation or jugglery of words. The Lord can travel more quickly than the mind. In the <span class="Italic">&#347;ruti-mantras</span> of <span class="Italic">&#298;&#347;opani&#7779;ad</span> it is said:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">anejad eka&#7745; manaso jav&#299;yo<br>nainad dev&#257; &#257;pnuvan p&#363;rvam ar&#7779;at<br>tad dh&#257;vato &rsquo;ny&#257;n atyeti ti&#7779;&#7789;hat<br>tasminn apo m&#257;tari&#347;v&#257; dadh&#257;ti</div>
</div><A NAME="98861"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Although fixed in His abode, the Personality of Godhead is swifter than the mind and can overcome all others running. The powerful demigods cannot approach Him. Although in one place, He controls those who supply the air and rain. He surpasses all in excellence.&rdquo; (<span class="Ref_Italic">&#298;&#347;opani&#7779;ad</span> 4) Thus the Supreme is never to be equaled by the subordinate living entities.</div>
<div class="Purport">Because the Lord is situated in everyone&rsquo;s heart and the individual living entity is not, never should the individual living entity be equated with the Supreme Lord.

<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">anidram,</span> meaning &ldquo;always awake and free from ignorance,&rdquo; is very important in this verse.

<div class="Translation">In the cycle of material activities, the material body resembles the wheel of a mental chariot. The ten senses [five for working and five for gathering knowledge] and the five life airs within the body form the fifteen spokes of the chariot&rsquo;s wheel. The three modes of nature [goodness, passion and ignorance] are its center of activities, and the eight ingredients of nature [earth, water, fire, air, sky, mind, intelligence and false ego] comprise the rim of the wheel. The external, material energy moves this wheel like electrical energy. Thus the wheel revolves very quickly around its hub or central support, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the Supersoul and the ultimate truth.

Because the Lord is beyond the cosmic manifestation, which is considered to be darkness, He is not visible to material eyes. Nonetheless, He is not separated from us by time or space, but is present everywhere.

In this material world, the three modes of material nature&mdash;goodness, passion and ignorance&mdash;prevail. Among these three, goodness is the platform of knowledge, and passion brings about a mixture of knowledge and ignorance, but the mode of ignorance is full of darkness. Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead is beyond darkness and passion. He is on the platform where goodness or knowledge is not disturbed by passion and ignorance. This is called the <span class="Italic">vasudeva</span> platform. It is on this platform of <span class="Italic">vasudeva</span> that V&#257;sudeva, or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, can appear. Thus K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appeared on this planet as the son of Vasudeva. Because the Lord is situated beyond the three modes of material nature, He is unseen by those who are dominated by these three modes. One must therefore become <span class="Italic">dh&#299;ra,</span> or undisturbed by the modes of material nature. The process of <span class="Italic">yoga</span> may be practiced by one who is free from the agitation of these modes. Therefore <span class="Italic">yoga</span> is defined in this way: <span class="Italic">yoga indriya-sa&#7745;yama&#7717;.</span> As previously explained, we are disturbed by the <span class="Italic">indriyas,</span> or senses. Moreover, we are agitated by the three modes of material nature, which are imposed upon us by the external energy. In conditional life, the living entity moves turbulently in the whirlpool of birth and death, but when one is situated on the transcendental platform of <span class="Italic">vi&#347;uddha-sattva,</span> pure goodness, he can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who sits on the back of Garu&#7693;a. Lord Brahm&#257; offers his respectful obeisances unto that Supreme Lord.</div>

Atheists think that they are independent, and therefore they do not care about the supremacy of the Lord, yet the Lord asserts His supremacy when He overcomes them as death. At the time of death, their attempts to use their so-called scientific knowledge and philosophical speculation to deny the supremacy of the Lord cannot work. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, for example, was an exalted representative of the atheistic class of men. He always challenged the existence of God, and thus he became inimical even toward his own son. Everyone was afraid of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu&rsquo;s atheistic principles. Nonetheless, when Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva appeared in order to kill him, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu&rsquo;s atheistic principles could not save him. Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva killed Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu and took away all his power, influence and pride. Atheistic men, however, never understand how everything they create is annihilated. The Supersoul is situated within them, but because of the predominance of the modes of passion and ignorance, they cannot understand the supremacy of the Lord. Even the demigods, the devotees, who are transcendentally situated or situated on the platform of goodness, are not fully aware of the qualities and position of the Lord. How then can the demons and atheists understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead? It is not possible. Therefore, to gain this understanding, the demigods, headed by Lord Brahm&#257;, offered their respectful obeisances to the Lord.</div>

He is the vital force for all vegetation. Unfortunately, modern so-called scientists, who do not fully understand the moon, describe the moon as being full of deserts. Since the moon is the source for our vegetation, how can the moon be a desert? The moonshine is the vital force for all vegetation, and therefore we cannot possibly accept that the moon is a desert.</div>

Materialists may argue, &ldquo;If this material world and its affairs are impossible to understand, how can we reject it?&rdquo; The answer is provided by the word <span class="Italic">prabudh&#257;pab&#257;dham.</span> We have to reject this material world because it is rejected by those who are learned in Vedic wisdom. Even though we cannot understand what this material world is, we should be ready to reject it in accordance with the advice of learned persons, especially the advice of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says:</div>

To go back to Godhead means to reject this material world. Although we cannot understand the functions of this material world and whether it is good for us or bad for us, in accordance with the advice of the supreme authority we must reject it and go back home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="First">In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index5584.html?g=745">2.40</a>), the Lord says <span class="Italic">svalpam apy asya dharmasya tr&#257;yate mahato bhay&#257;t:</span> this <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> devotional service, is so important that even if performed to a very small, almost negligible extent, it can give one the supreme result. There are many instances in the history of the world in which even a slight service rendered to the Lord has saved a living entity from the greatest danger. Aj&#257;mila, for example, was saved by the Supreme Personality of Godhead from the greatest danger, that of going to hell. He was saved simply because he chanted the name N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a at the end of his life. When Aj&#257;mila chanted this holy name of the Lord, N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, he did not chant knowingly; actually he was calling his youngest son, whose name was N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. Nonetheless, Lord N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a took this chanting seriously, and thus Aj&#257;mila achieved the result of <span class="Italic">ante n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a-sm&#7771;ti&#7717;,</span> remembering N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a at the end of life. If one somehow or other remembers the holy name of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a or R&#257;ma at the end of life, he immediately achieves the transcendental result of going back home, back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purport">The Supreme Personality of Godhead is actually the only object of our love. As long as we are in this material world we have so many desires to fulfill, but when we come in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we immediately become perfect and fully satisfied, just as a child is fully satisfied when he comes to the lap of his mother. Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja went to the forest to achieve some material result by austerity and penance, but when he actually saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead he said, &ldquo;I do not want any material benediction. I am completely satisfied.&rdquo; Even if one wants some material benefit from serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this can be achieved extremely easily, without hard labor. Therefore the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra</span> recommends:</div>

<div class="Translation">My Lord, all obeisances unto You, who are eternal, beyond time&rsquo;s limits of past, present and future. You are inconceivable in Your activities, You are the master of the three modes of material nature, and, being transcendental to all material qualities, You are free from material contamination.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Supreme Personality of Godhead controls the material activities manifested by the three modes of material nature. As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> <span class="Italic">nirgu&#7751;a&#7745; gu&#7751;a-bhokt&#7771; ca:</span> the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always transcendental to the material qualities (<span class="Italic">sattva-gu&#7751;a, rajo-gu&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">tamo-gu&#7751;a</span>), but nonetheless He is their controller. The Lord manifests Himself in three features&mdash;as Brahm&#257;, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and Mahe&#347;vara&mdash;to control these three qualities. He personally takes charge of <span class="Italic">sattva-gu&#7751;a</span> as Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and He entrusts the charge of <span class="Italic">rajo-gu&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">tamo-gu&#7751;a</span> to Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord &#346;iva. Ultimately, however, He is the controller of all three <span class="Italic">gu&#7751;as.</span> Lord Brahm&#257;, expressing his appreciation, said that because Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u had now taken charge of the activities of goodness, there was every hope that the demigods would be successful in fulfilling their desires. The demigods were harassed by the demons, who were infested with <span class="Italic">tamo-gu&#7751;a.</span> However, as Lord Brahm&#257; has previously described, since the time of <span class="Italic">sattva-gu&#7751;a</span> had now arrived, the demigods could naturally expect to fulfill their desires. The demigods are supposedly well advanced in knowledge, yet they could not understand the knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Lord is addressed here as <span class="Italic">anant&#257;ya.</span> Although Lord Brahm&#257; knows past, present and future, he is unable to understand the unlimited knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This chapter describes how the Lord appeared before the demigods when they offered Him their prayers. Following the advice of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demigods executed a truce with the demons for the purpose of churning nectar from the sea.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Because of the prayers offered by the demigods in the previous chapter, Lord K&#7779;&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u was pleased with the demigods, and thus He appeared before them. The demigods were almost blinded by His transcendental bodily effulgence. At first, therefore, they could not even see any part of His body. After some time, however, when Brahm&#257; could see the Lord, he, along with Lord &#346;iva, began to offer the Lord prayers.</div>
</div><A NAME="99223"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Lord Brahm&#257; said: &ldquo;The Supreme Personality of Godhead, being beyond birth and death, is eternal. He has no material qualities. Yet He is the ocean of unlimited auspicious qualities. He is subtler than the most subtle, He is invisible, and His form is inconceivable. He is worshipable for all the demigods. Innumerable universes exist within His form, and therefore He is never separated from these universes by time, space or circumstances. He is the chief and the <span class="Italic">pradh&#257;na.</span> Although He is the beginning, the middle and the end of the material creation, the idea of pantheism conceived by M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers has no validity. The Supreme Personality of Godhead controls the entire material manifestation through His subordinate agent, the external energy. Because of His inconceivable transcendental position, He is always the master of the material energy. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His various forms, is always present even within this material world, but the material qualities cannot touch Him. One can understand His position only by His instructions, as given in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span>&rdquo; As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index0c2e.html?g=3378">10.10</a>), <span class="Italic">dad&#257;mi buddhi-yoga&#7745; tam.</span> <span class="Italic">Buddhi-yoga</span> means <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> Only through the process of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> can one understand the Supreme Lord.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">When offered prayers by Lord &#346;iva and Lord Brahm&#257;, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was pleased. Thus He gave appropriate instructions to all the demigods. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is known as Ajita, unconquerable, advised the demigods to make a peace proposal to the demons, so that after formulating a truce, the demigods and demons could churn the ocean of milk. The rope would be the biggest serpent, known as V&#257;suki, and the churning rod would be Mandara Mountain. Poison would also be produced from the churning, but it would be taken by Lord &#346;iva, and so there would be no need to fear it. Many other attractive things would be generated by the churning, but the Lord warned the demigods not to be captivated by such things. Nor should the demigods be angry if there were some disturbances. After advising the demigods in this way, the Lord disappeared from the scene.</div>
</div><A NAME="99225"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Following the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demigods established a peace with Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bali, the King of the demons. Then both the demons and the demigods started for the ocean, taking Mandara Mountain with them. Because of the great heaviness of the mountain, the demigods and demons became fatigued, and some of them actually died. Then the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, appeared there on the back of His carrier, Garu&#7693;a, and by His mercy He brought these demigods and demons back to life. The Lord then lifted the mountain with one of His hands and placed it on the back of Garu&#7693;a. The Lord sat on the mountain and was carried to the spot of the churning by Garu&#7693;a, who placed the mountain in the middle of the sea. Then the Lord asked Garu&#7693;a to leave that place because as long as Garu&#7693;a was present, V&#257;suki could not come there.</div>

<div class="Translation">As one can derive fire from wood, milk from the milk bag of the cow, food grains and water from the land, and prosperity in one&rsquo;s livelihood from industrial enterprises, so, by the practice of bhakti-yoga, even within this material world, one can achieve Your favor or intelligently approach You. Those who are pious all affirm this.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead is <span class="Italic">nirgu&#7751;a,</span> not to be found within this material world, the entire material world is pervaded by Him, as stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">may&#257; tatam ida&#7745; sarvam</span>). The material world is nothing but an expansion of the Lord&rsquo;s material energy, and the entire cosmic manifestation rests upon Him (<span class="Italic">mat-sth&#257;ni sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;ni</span>). Nonetheless, the Supreme Lord cannot be found here (<span class="Italic">na c&#257;ha&#7745; te&#7779;v avasthita&#7717;</span>). A devotee, however, can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the practice of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> One ordinarily does not begin to practice <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> unless he has practiced it in previous births. Moreover, one can begin <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> only by the mercy of the spiritual master and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. <span class="Italic">Guru-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-pras&#257;de p&#257;ya bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja.</span> The seed of devotional service is obtainable by the mercy of <span class="Italic">guru,</span> the spiritual master, and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purport">Only by the practice of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> can one achieve the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and see Him face to face (<span class="Italic">prem&#257;&ntilde;jana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santa&#7717; sadaiva h&#7771;daye&#7779;u vilokayanti</I></span> [Bs. </I>5.38</I>]</I>). One cannot see the Lord by other methods, such as <span class="Italic">karma, j&ntilde;&#257;na</span> or <span class="Italic">yoga.</span> Under the direction of the spiritual master, one must cultivate <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> (<span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;a&#7745; k&#299;rtana&#7745; vi&#7779;&#7751;o&#7717; smara&#7751;a&#7745; p&#257;da-sevanam </I>[SB </I></span><a href="indexda76.html?g=55355">7.5.23</a>]). Then, even within this material world, although the Lord is not visible, a devotee can see Him. This is confirmed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">bhakty&#257; m&#257;m abhij&#257;n&#257;ti y&#257;v&#257;n ya&#347; c&#257;smi tattvata&#7717;</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexbf7d.html?g=5898">18.55</a>]) and in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<span class="Italic">bhakty&#257;ham ekay&#257; gr&#257;hya&#7717;</span>). Thus by devotional service one can achieve the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although He is not visible or understandable to materialistic persons.</div>
<div class="Purport">In this verse, the cultivation of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> is compared to many material activities. By friction one can get fire from wood, by digging the earth one can get food grains and water, and by agitating the milk bag of the cow one can get nectarean milk. Milk is compared to nectar, which one can drink to become immortal. Of course, simply drinking milk will not make one immortal, but it can increase the duration of one&rsquo;s life. In modern civilization, men do not think milk to be important, and therefore they do not live very long. Although in this age men can live up to one hundred years, their duration of life is reduced because they do not drink large quantities of milk. This is a sign of Kali-yuga. In Kali-yuga, instead of drinking milk, people prefer to slaughter an animal and eat its flesh. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His instructions of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> advises <span class="Italic">go-rak&#7779;ya,</span> which means cow protection. The cow should be protected, milk should be drawn from the cows, and this milk should be prepared in various ways. One should take ample milk, and thus one can prolong one&rsquo;s life, develop his brain, execute devotional service, and ultimately attain the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As it is essential to get food grains and water by digging the earth, it is also essential to give protection to the cows and take nectarean milk from their milk bags.</div>
<div class="Purport">The people of this age are inclined toward industrial enterprises for comfortable living, but they refuse to endeavor to execute devotional service, by which they can achieve the ultimate goal of life by returning home, back to Godhead. Unfortunately, as it is said, <span class="Italic">na te vidu&#7717; sv&#257;rtha-gati&#7745; hi vi&#7779;&#7751;u&#7745; dur&#257;&#347;ay&#257; ye bahir-artha-m&#257;nina&#7717;</I> [SB </I></span><a href="index2706.html?g=55424">7.5.31</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> People without spiritual education do not know that the ultimate goal of life is to go back home, back to Godhead. Forgetting this aim of life, they are working very hard in disappointment and frustration (<span class="Italic">mogh&#257;&#347;&#257; mogha-karm&#257;&#7751;o mogha j&ntilde;&#257;n&#257; vicetasa&#7717;</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexaa7c.html?g=3093">9.12</a>]). The so-called <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas</span>&mdash;the industrialists or businessmen&mdash;are involved in big, big industrial enterprises, but they are not interested in food grains and milk. However, as indicated here, by digging for water, even in the desert, we can produce food grains; when we produce food grains and vegetables, we can give protection to the cows; while giving protection to the cows, we can draw from them abundant quantities of milk; and by getting enough milk and combining it with food grains and vegetables, we can prepare hundreds of nectarean foods. We can happily eat this food and thus avoid industrial enterprises and joblessness.</div>
<div class="Purport">Agriculture and cow protection are the way to become sinless and thus be attracted to devotional service. Those who are sinful cannot be attracted by devotional service. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index49d1.html?g=2712">7.28</a>):</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Elephants afflicted by a forest fire become very happy when they get water from the Ganges. Similarly, O my Lord, from whose navel grows a lotus flower, since You have now appeared before us, we have become transcendentally happy. By seeing Your Lordship, whom we have desired to see for a very long time, we have achieved our ultimate goal in life.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The devotees of the Lord are always very eager to see the Supreme Lord face to face, but they do not demand that the Lord come before them, for a pure devotee considers such a demand to be contrary to devotional service. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu teaches this lesson in His <span class="Italic">&#346;ik&#7779;&#257;&#7779;&#7789;aka.</span> <span class="Italic">Adar&#347;an&#257;n marma-hat&#257;&#7745; karotu v&#257;.</span> The devotee is always eager to see the Lord face to face, but if he is brokenhearted because he cannot see the Lord, even life after life, he will never command the Lord to appear. This is a sign of pure devotion. Therefore in this verse we find the word <span class="Italic">ati-cira-&#299;psita-artham,</span> meaning that the devotee aspires for a long, long time to see the Lord. If the Lord, by His own pleasure, appears before the devotee, the devotee feels extremely happy, as Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja felt when he personally saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja saw the Lord, he had no desire to ask the Lord for any benediction. Indeed, simply by seeing the Lord, Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja felt so satisfied that he did not want to ask the Lord for any benediction (<span class="Italic">sv&#257;min k&#7771;t&#257;rtho &rsquo;smi vara&#7745; na y&#257;ce</span>). A pure devotee, whether able or unable to see the Lord, always engages in the Lord&rsquo;s devotional service, always hoping that at some time the Lord may be pleased to appear before him so that he can see the Lord face to face.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">I [Lord Brahm&#257;], Lord &#346;iva and all the demigods, accompanied by the praj&#257;patis like Dak&#7779;a, are nothing but sparks illuminated by You, who are the original fire. Since we are particles of You, what can we understand about our welfare? O Supreme Lord, please give us the means of deliverance that is suitable for the br&#257;hma&#7751;as and demigods.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In this verse, the word <span class="Italic">dvija-deva-mantram</span> is very important. The word <span class="Italic">mantra</span> means &ldquo;that which delivers one from the material world.&rdquo; Only the <span class="Italic">dvijas</span> (the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span>) and the <span class="Italic">devas</span> (the demigods) can be delivered from material existence by the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Whatever is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is a <span class="Italic">mantra</span> and is suitable for delivering the conditioned souls from mental speculation. The conditioned souls are engaged in a struggle for existence (<span class="Italic">mana&#7717; &#7779;a&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;n&#299;ndriy&#257;&#7751;i prak&#7771;ti-sth&#257;ni kar&#7779;ati </I>[Bg.<B> </B></I></span><a href="index6669.html?g=4886">15.7</a>]). Deliverance from this struggle constitutes the highest benefit, but unless one gets a <span class="Italic">mantra</span> from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, deliverance is impossible. The beginning <span class="Italic">mantra</span> is the G&#257;yatr&#299; <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> Therefore, after purification, when one is qualified to become a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> (<span class="Italic">dvija</span>), he is offered the G&#257;yatr&#299; <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> Simply by chanting the G&#257;yatr&#299; <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> one can be delivered. This <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> however, is suitable only for the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and demigods. In Kali-yuga, we are all in a very difficult position, in which we need a suitable <span class="Italic">mantra</span> that can deliver us from the dangers of this age. Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His incarnation as Lord Caitanya, gives us the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra.</span></div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">harer n&#257;ma harer n&#257;ma<br>harer n&#257;maiva kevalam<br>kalau n&#257;sty eva n&#257;sty eva<br>n&#257;sty eva gatir anyath&#257;<br></I> [Adi </I><a href="indexd751.html?g=93741">17.21</a></I>]</I></div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting the holy name of the Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way.&rdquo; In His <span class="Italic">&#346;ik&#7779;&#257;&#7779;&#7789;aka,</span> Lord Caitanya says, <span class="Italic">para&#7745; vijayate &#347;r&#299;-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-sa&#7749;k&#299;rtanam:</span> &ldquo;All glories to the chanting of <span class="Italic">&#347;r&#299;-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana!</span>&rdquo; The <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra</span>&mdash;Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare Hare/ Hare R&#257;ma, Hare R&#257;ma, R&#257;ma R&#257;ma, Hare Hare&mdash;is directly chanted by the Lord Himself, who gives us this <span class="Italic">mantra</span> for deliverance.</div>
<div class="Purport">We cannot invent any means to be delivered from the dangers of material existence. Here, even the demigods, such as Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord &#346;iva, and the <span class="Italic">praj&#257;patis,</span> such as Dak&#7779;a, are said to be like illuminating sparks in the presence of the Supreme Lord, who is compared to a great fire. Sparks are beautiful as long as they are in the fire. Similarly, we have to remain in the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and always engage in devotional service, for then we shall always be brilliant and illuminating. As soon as we fall from the service of the Lord, our brilliance and illumination will immediately be extinguished, or at least stopped for some time. When we living entities, who are like sparks of the original fire, the Supreme Lord, fall into a material condition, we must take the <span class="Italic">mantra</span> from the Supreme Personality of Godhead as it is offered by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. By chanting this Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> we shall be delivered from all the difficulties of this material world.</div>

The demigods went to Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja with the proposal to manufacture nectar, and the Daityas, the demons, immediately accepted it, thinking that since the demigods were already weak, when the nectar was produced the demons would take it from them and use it for their own purposes. The demigods, of course, had similar intentions. The only difference is that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, was on the side of the demigods because the demigods were His devotees, whereas the demons did not care about Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Here is proof of the omnipotence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is above everyone. There are two classes of living entities&mdash;the demons and the demigods&mdash;and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is above them both. The demons believe in the &ldquo;chance&rdquo; theory of creation, whereas the demigods believe in creation by the hand of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The omnipotence of the Supreme Lord is proved here, for simply with one hand He lifted Mandara Mountain, the demigods and the demons, placed them on the back of Garu&#7693;a and brought them to the ocean of milk. Now, the demigods, the devotees, would immediately accept this incident, knowing that the Lord can lift anything, however heavy it might be. But although demons were also carried along with the demigods, demons, upon hearing of this incident, would say that it is mythological. But if God is all-powerful, why would it be difficult for Him to lift a mountain? Since He is floating innumerable planets with many hundreds and thousands of Mandara Mountains, why can&rsquo;t He lift one of them with His hand? This is not mythology, but the difference between the believers and the faithless is that the devotees accept the incidents mentioned in the Vedic literatures to be true, whereas the demons simply argue and label all these historical incidents mythology. Demons would prefer to explain that everything happening in the cosmic manifestation takes place by chance, but demigods, or devotees, never consider anything to be chance. Rather, they know that everything is an arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the difference between the demigods and the demons.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Garu&#7693;a was asked by the Lord to leave that place because the snake V&#257;suki, who was to be used as the rope for churning, could not go there in the presence of Garu&#7693;a. Garu&#7693;a, the carrier of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, is not a vegetarian. He eats big snakes. V&#257;suki, being a great snake, would be natural food for Garu&#7693;a, the chief of birds. Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u therefore asked Garu&#7693;a to leave so that V&#257;suki could be brought to churn the ocean with Mandara Mountain, which was to be used as the churning rod. These are the wonderful arrangements of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Nothing takes place by accident. Carrying Mandara Mountain on the back of a bird and putting it in its right position might be difficult for anyone, whether demigod or demon, but for the Supreme Personality of Godhead everything is possible, as shown by this pastime. The Lord had no difficulty lifting the mountain with one hand, and Garu&#7693;a, His carrier, carried all the demons and demigods together by the grace of the Supreme Lord. The Lord is known as Yoge&#347;vara, the master of all mystic power, because of His omnipotence. If He likes, He can make anything lighter than cotton or heavier than the universe. Those who do not believe in the activities of the Lord cannot explain how things happen. Using words like &ldquo;accident,&rdquo; they take shelter of ideas that are unbelievable. Nothing is accidental. Everything is done by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as the Lord Himself confirms in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index652d.html?g=3075">9.10</a>). <span class="Italic">May&#257;dhyak&#7779;e&#7751;a prak&#7771;ti&#7717; s&#363;yate sacar&#257;caram.</span> Whatever actions and reactions occur within the cosmic manifestation all take place under the superintendence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The summary of the Seventh Chapter is as follows. As described in this chapter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appearing in His incarnation as a tortoise, dove deep into the ocean to carry Mandara Mountain on His back. At first the churning of the ocean produced <span class="Italic">k&#257;lak&#363;&#7789;a</span> poison. Everyone feared this poison, but Lord &#346;iva satisfied them by drinking it.</div>
</div><A NAME="99722"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">With the understanding that when the nectar was generated from the churning they would share it equally, the demigods and the demons brought V&#257;suki to be used as the rope for the churning rod. By the expert arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demons held the snake near the mouth, whereas the demigods held the tail of the great snake. Then, with great endeavor, they began pulling the snake in both directions. Because the churning rod, Mandara Mountain, was very heavy and was not held by any support in the water, it sank into the ocean, and in this way the prowess of both the demons and the demigods was vanquished. The Supreme Personality of Godhead then appeared in the form of a tortoise and supported Mandara Mountain on His back. Then the churning resumed with great force. As a result of the churning, a huge amount of poison was produced. The <span class="Italic">praj&#257;patis,</span> seeing no one else to save them, approached Lord &#346;iva and offered him prayers full of truth. Lord &#346;iva is called &#256;&#347;uto&#7779;a because he is very pleased if one is a devotee. Therefore he easily agreed to drink all the poison generated by the churning. The goddess Durg&#257;, Bhav&#257;n&#299;, the wife of Lord &#346;iva, was not at all disturbed when Lord &#346;iva agreed to drink the poison, for she knew Lord &#346;iva&rsquo;s prowess. Indeed, she expressed her pleasure at this agreement. Then Lord &#346;iva gathered the devastating poison, which was everywhere. He took it in his hand and drank it. After he drank the poison, his neck became bluish. A small quantity of the poison dropped from his hands to the ground, and it is because of this poison that there are poisonous snakes, scorpions, toxic plants and other poisonous things in this world.</div>

<div class="Translation">The leaders of the demons thought it unwise to hold the tail, the inauspicious portion of the snake. Instead, they wanted to hold the front, which had been taken by the Personality of Godhead and the demigods, because that portion was auspicious and glorious. Thus the demons, on the plea that they were all highly advanced students of Vedic knowledge and were all famous for their birth and activities, protested that they wanted to hold the front of the snake.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The demons thought that the front of the snake was auspicious and that catching hold of that portion would be more chivalrous. Moreover, Daityas must always do the opposite of the demigods. That is their nature. We have actually seen this in relation to our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement. We are advocating cow protection and encouraging people to drink more milk and eat palatable preparations made of milk, but the demons, just to protest such proposals, are claiming that they are advanced in scientific knowledge, as described here by the words <span class="Italic">sv&#257;dhy&#257;ya-&#347;ruta-sampann&#257;&#7717;.</span> They say that according to their scientific way, they have discovered that milk is dangerous and that the beef obtained by killing cows is very nutritious. This difference of opinion will always continue. Indeed, it has existed since days of yore. Millions of years ago, there was the same competition. The demons, as a result of their so-called Vedic study, preferred to hold the side of the snake near the mouth. The Supreme Personality of Godhead thought it wise to catch hold of the dangerous part of the snake and allow the demons to hold the tail, which was not dangerous, but because of a competitive desire, the demons thought it wise to hold the snake near the mouth. If the demigods were going to drink poison, the demons would resolve, &ldquo;Why should we not share the poison and die gloriously by drinking it?&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">In regard to the words <span class="Italic">sv&#257;dhy&#257;ya-&#347;ruta-sampann&#257;&#7717; prakhy&#257;t&#257; janma-karmabhi&#7717;,</span> another question may be raised. If one is actually educated in Vedic knowledge, is famous for performing prescribed activities and has been born in a great aristocratic family, why should he be called a demon? The answer is that one may be highly educated and may have been born in an aristocratic family, but if he is godless, if he does not listen to the instructions of God, then he is a demon. There are many examples in history of men like Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, R&#257;va&#7751;a and Ka&#7745;sa who were well educated, who were born in aristocratic families and who were very powerful and chivalrous in fighting, but who, because of deriding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, were called R&#257;k&#7779;asas, or demons. One may be very well educated, but if he has no sense of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, no obedience to the Supreme Lord, he is a demon.

As we have previously described, there are two classes of men&mdash;the demons and the demigods&mdash;but neither of them are supremely powerful. Everyone has experienced that hindrances are imposed upon us by the supreme power. The demons regard these hindrances as mere accidents or chance, but devotees accept them to be acts of the supreme ruler. When faced with hindrances, therefore, devotees pray to the Lord. <span class="Italic">Tat te &rsquo;nukamp&#257;&#7745; susam&#299;k&#7779;am&#257;&#7751;o bhu&ntilde;j&#257;na ev&#257;tma-k&#7771;ta&#7745; vip&#257;kam.</span> Devotees endure hindrances, accepting them to be caused by the Supreme Personality of Godhead and regarding them as benedictions. Demons, however, being unable to understand the supreme controller, regard such hindrances as accidental. Here, of course, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was present personally. It was by His will that there were hindrances, and by His will those hindrances were removed. The Lord appeared as a tortoise to support the great mountain. <span class="Italic">K&#7779;itir iha vipulatare tava ti&#7779;&#7789;hati p&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;he.</span> The Lord held the great mountain on His back. <span class="Italic">Ke&#347;ava dh&#7771;ta-k&#363;rma-&#347;ar&#299;ra jaya jagad&#299;&#347;a hare.</span> Dangers can be created by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and they can also be removed by Him.

<div class="Translation">It is said that great personalities almost always accept voluntary suffering because of the suffering of people in general. This is considered the highest method of worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present in everyone&rsquo;s heart.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Here is an explanation of how those engaged in activities for the welfare of others are very quickly recognized by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index2d38.html?g=6015">18.68</a>&ndash;69), <span class="Italic">ya ida&#7745; parama&#7745; guhya&#7745; mad-bhakte&#7779;v abhidh&#257;syati.</span> <span class="Italic">.. na ca tasm&#257;n manu&#7779;ye&#7779;u ka&#347;cin me priya-k&#7771;ttama&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;One who preaches the message of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> to My devotees is most dear to Me. No one can excel him in satisfying Me by worship.&rdquo; There are different kinds of welfare activities in this material world, but the supreme welfare activity is the spreading of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. Other welfare activities cannot be effective, for the laws of nature and the results of <span class="Italic">karma</span> cannot be checked. It is by destiny, or the laws of <span class="Italic">karma,</span> that one must suffer or enjoy. For instance, if one is given a court order, he must accept it, whether it brings suffering or profit. Similarly, everyone is under obligations to <span class="Italic">karma</span> and it reactions. No one can change this. Therefore the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra</span> says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">tasyaiva heto&#7717; prayateta kovido<br>na labhyate yad bhramat&#257;m upary adha&#7717;</div>

<div class="VerseRef">(<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="index968b.html?g=7485">1.5.18</a>)</div>
<div class="After-Verse">One should endeavor for that which is never obtained by wandering up and down the universe as a result of the reactions of <span class="Italic">karma.</span> What is that? One should endeavor to become K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious. If one tries to spread K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness all over the world, he should be understood to be performing the best welfare activity. The Lord is automatically very pleased with him. If the Lord is pleased with him, what is left for him to achieve? If one has been recognized by the Lord, even if he does not ask the Lord for anything, the Lord, who is within everyone, supplies him whatever he wants. This is also confirmed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">te&#7779;&#257;&#7745; nity&#257;bhiyukt&#257;n&#257;&#7745; yoga-k&#7779;ema&#7745; vah&#257;my aham</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index36d6.html?g=3183">9.22</a>]). Again, as stated here, <span class="Italic">tapyante loka-t&#257;pena s&#257;dhava&#7717; pr&#257;ya&#347;o jan&#257;&#7717;.</span> The best welfare activity is raising people to the platform of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, since the conditioned souls are suffering only for want of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. The Lord Himself also comes to mitigate the suffering of humanity.</div>

</div><A NAME="100344"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">After Lord &#346;iva drank all the poison, both the demigods and demons took courage and resumed their activities of churning. Because of this churning, first a <span class="Italic">surabhi</span> cow was produced. Great saintly persons accepted this cow to derive clarified butter from its milk and offer this clarified butter in oblations for great sacrifices. Thereafter, a horse named Uccai&#7717;&#347;rav&#257; was generated. This horse was taken by Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. Then there appeared Air&#257;vata and other elephants that could go anywhere in any direction, and she-elephants also appeared. The gem known as Kaustubha was also generated, and Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u took that gem and placed it on His chest. Thereafter, a <span class="Italic">p&#257;rij&#257;ta</span> flower and the Apsar&#257;s, the most beautiful women in the universe, were generated. Then the goddess of fortune, Lak&#7779;m&#299;, appeared. The demigods, great sages, Gandharvas and others offered her their respectful worship. The goddess of fortune could not find anyone to accept as her husband. At last she selected Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u to be her master. Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u gave her a place to stay everlastingly at His chest. Because of this combination of Lak&#7779;m&#299; and N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, all who were present, including the demigods and people in general, were very pleased. The demons, however, being neglected by the goddess of fortune, were very depressed. Then V&#257;ru&#7751;&#299;, the goddess of drinking, was generated, and by the order of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u the demons accepted her. Then the demons and demigods, with renewed energy, began to churn again. This time a partial incarnation of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u called Dhanvantari appeared. He was very beautiful, and he carried a jug containing nectar. The demons immediately snatched the jug from Dhanvantari&rsquo;s hand and began to run away, and the demigods, being very morose, took shelter of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. After the demons snatched the jug from Dhanvantari, they began to fight among themselves. Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u solaced the demigods, who therefore did not fight, but remained silent. While the fighting was going on among the demons, the Lord Himself appeared as the incarnation Mohin&#299;, the most beautiful woman in the universe.</div>

<div class="First">Who in this world does not want to possess wealth, beauty and the social respectability that come from these opulences?

Material enjoyment entails money, beauty and the reputation they bring, which can all be achieved by the mercy of the goddess of fortune. The goddess of fortune, however, never remains alone. As indicated in the previous verse by the word <span class="Italic">bhagavat-par&#257;,</span> she is the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is enjoyable only by Him. If one wants the favor of the goddess of fortune, mother Lak&#7779;m&#299;, because she is by nature <span class="Italic">bhagavat-par&#257;</span> one must keep her with N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a.

Theirs is not a good policy. The celebrated demon R&#257;va&#7751;a, for example, wanted to deprive R&#257;macandra of Lak&#7779;m&#299;, S&#299;t&#257;, and thus be victorious, but the result was just the opposite. S&#299;t&#257;, of course, was taken by force by Lord R&#257;macandra, and R&#257;va&#7751;a and his entire material empire were vanquished. The goddess of fortune is desirable for everyone, including human beings, but one should understand that the goddess of fortune is the exclusive property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One cannot achieve the mercy of the goddess of fortune unless one prays both to her and to the supreme enjoyer, the Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="First">The statement <span class="Italic">dharma&#7717; kvacit tatra na bh&#363;ta-sauh&#7771;dam</span> is very important in this verse. We actually see that there are many Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Buddhists and religionists of other cults who adhere to their religious principles very nicely but are not equal to all living entities. Indeed, although they profess to be very religious, they kill poor animals. Such religion has no meaning. <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="index12a8.html?g=6397">1.2.8</a>) says:</div>

<div class="After-Verse">One may be very expert in following the religious principles of his own sect, but if he has no tendency to love the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his observance of religious principles is simply a waste of time. One must develop a sense of loving V&#257;sudeva (<span class="Italic">v&#257;sudeva&#7717; sarvam iti sa mah&#257;tm&#257; sudurlabha&#7717;</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index4112.html?g=2631">7.19</a>]). The sign of a devotee is that he is a friend to everyone (<span class="Italic">suh&#7771;da&#7745; sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;n&#257;m</span>). A devotee will never allow a poor animal to be killed in the name of religion. This is the difference between a superficially religious person and a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purport">We find that there have been many great heroes in history, but they could not escape from the cruel hands of death. Even the greatest hero cannot escape from the ruling power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead when K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a comes as death. That is described by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself: <span class="Italic">m&#7771;tyu&#7717; sarva-hara&#347; c&#257;ham.</span> The Lord, appearing as death, takes away a hero&rsquo;s so-called power. Even Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu could not be saved when N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva appeared before him as death.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This is the symptom of demons. The first concern of a nondevotee is how to enjoy his personal sense gratification at once, whereas the devotee&rsquo;s first concern is to satisfy the Lord. This is the distinction between the nondevotee and the devotee. In this material world, since most people are nondevotees, they regularly compete, fight, disagree and war among themselves, for everyone wants to enjoy and satisfy his own senses. Therefore, unless such demons become K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious and are trained to satisfy the senses of the Lord, there can be no question of peace in human society or any society, even that of the demigods. The demigods and devotees, however, always surrender to the lotus feet of the Lord, and thus the Lord is always anxious to satisfy their ambitions. While the demons fight to satisfy their own senses, devotees engage in devotional service to satisfy the senses of the Lord. The members of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement must be alert in regard to this point, and then their preaching of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement will be successful.</div>

All the demons became captivated by the young woman&rsquo;s beauty and became attached to Her. Now, because the demons were fighting among themselves to possess the nectar, they selected this beautiful woman as a mediator to settle their quarrel. Taking advantage of their weakness in this regard, Mohin&#299;, the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, got the demons to promise that whatever decision She might give, they would not refuse to accept it. When the demons made this promise, the beautiful woman, Mohin&#299;-m&#363;rti, had the demigods and demons sit in different lines so that She could distribute the nectar. She knew that the demons were quite unfit to drink the nectar. Therefore, by cheating them She distributed all the nectar to the demigods. When the demons saw this cheating of Mohin&#299;-m&#363;rti, they remained silent. But one demon, named R&#257;hu, dressed himself like a demigod and sat down in the line of the demigods. He sat beside the sun and the moon. When the Supreme Personality of Godhead understood how R&#257;hu was cheating, He immediately cut off the demon&rsquo;s head. R&#257;hu, however, had already tasted the nectar, and therefore although his head was severed, he remained alive. After the demigods finished drinking the nectar, the Supreme Personality of Godhead assumed His own form. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; ends this chapter by describing how powerful is the chanting of the holy names, pastimes and paraphernalia of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation">The place, the time, the cause, the purpose, the activity and the ambition were all the same for both the demigods and the demons, but the demigods achieved one result and the demons another. Because the demigods are always under the shelter of the dust of the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet, they could very easily drink the nectar and get its result. The demons, however, not having sought shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord, were unable to achieve the result they desired.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index477f.html?g=1523">4.11</a>) it is said, <span class="Italic">ye yath&#257; m&#257;&#7745; prapadyante t&#257;&#7745;s tathaiva bhaj&#257;my aham:</span> the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme judge who rewards or punishes different persons according to their surrender unto His lotus feet. Therefore it can actually be seen that although <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">bhaktas</span> may work in the same place, at the same time, with the same energy and with the same ambition, they achieve different results. The <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> transmigrate through different bodies in the cycle of birth and death, sometimes going upward and sometimes downward, thus suffering the results of their actions in the <span class="Italic">karma-cakra,</span> the cycle of birth and death. The devotees, however, because of fully surrendering at the lotus feet of the Lord, are never baffled in their attempts. Although externally they work almost like the <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s,</span> the devotees go back home, back to Godhead, and achieve success in every effort. The demons or atheists have faith in their own endeavors, but although they work very hard day and night, they cannot get any more than their destiny. The devotees, however, can surpass the reactions of <span class="Italic">karma</span> and achieve wonderful results, even without effort. It is also said, <span class="Italic">phalena paric&#299;yate:</span> one&rsquo;s success or defeat in any activity is understood by its result. There are many <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> in the dress of devotees, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead can detect their purpose. The <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> want to use the property of the Lord for their selfish sense gratification, but a devotee endeavors to use the Lord&rsquo;s property for God&rsquo;s service. Therefore a devotee is always distinct from the <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s,</span> although the <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> may dress like devotees. As confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexde01.html?g=1113">3.9</a>), <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;&#257;rth&#257;t karma&#7751;o &rsquo;nyatra loko &rsquo;ya&#7745; karma-bandhana&#7717;.</span> One who works for Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is free from this material world, and after giving up his body he goes back home, back to Godhead. A <span class="Italic">karm&#299;,</span> however, although externally working like a devotee, is entangled in his nondevotional activity, and thus he suffers the tribulations of material existence. Thus from the results achieved by the <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> and devotees, one can understand the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who acts differently for the <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s</span> than for the devotees. The author of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299; Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta</span> therefore says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-bhakta&mdash;&mdash;ni&#7779;k&#257;ma, ataeva &lsquo;&#347;&#257;nta&rsquo;<br>bhukti-mukti-siddhi-k&#257;m&#299;&mdash;&mdash;sakali &lsquo;a&#347;&#257;nta&rsquo;</div>

But the devotee, who does not expect any personal benefit and whose only ambition is to spread the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is blessed with all the auspicious results of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> without hard labor.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Both the demigods and the demons are expert in activities involving the material energy, but the demigods are devotees of the Lord, whereas the demons are just the opposite. The demigods and demons churned the ocean of milk to get nectar from it, but the demons, not being devotees of the Lord, could derive no profit. After feeding nectar to the demigods, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u returned to His abode on the back of Garu&#7693;a, but the demons, being most aggrieved, again declared war against the demigods. Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, the son of Virocana, became the commander in chief of the demons. In the beginning of the battle, the demigods prepared to defeat the demons. Indra, King of heaven, fought with Bali, and other demigods, like V&#257;yu, Agni and Varu&#7751;a, fought against other leaders of the demons. In this fight the demons were defeated, and to save themselves from death they began to manifest many illusions through material maneuvers, killing many soldiers on the side of the demigods. The demigods, finding no other recourse, surrendered again to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, who then appeared and counteracted all the illusions presented by the jugglery of the demons. Heroes among the demons such as K&#257;lanemi, M&#257;l&#299;, Sum&#257;l&#299; and M&#257;lyav&#257;n fought the Supreme Personality of Godhead and were all killed by the Lord.

All of these demons had been deprived of their share of the nectar and had shared merely in the labor of churning the ocean. Now, they fought against the demigods, and to encourage their armies, they made a tumultuous sound like the roaring of lions and blew loudly on conchshells. Balabhit, Lord Indra, upon seeing this situation of his ferocious rivals, became extremely angry.</div>

<div class="Translation">Because of the impact on the ground of the legs of the demons and demigods and the wheels of the chariots, particles of dust flew violently into the sky and made a dust cloud that covered all directions of outer space, as far as the sun. But when the particles of dust were followed by drops of blood being sprinkled all over space, the dust cloud could no longer float in the sky.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The cloud of dust covered the entire horizon, but when drops of blood sprayed up as far as the sun, the dust cloud could no longer float in the sky. A point to be observed here is that although the blood is stated to have reached the sun, it is not said to have reached the moon. Apparently, therefore, as stated elsewhere in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> the sun, not the moon, is the planet nearest the earth. We have already discussed this point in many places. The sun is first, then the moon, then Mars, Jupiter and so on. The sun is supposed to be 93,000,000 miles above the surface of the earth, and from the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> we understand that the moon is 1,600,000 miles above the sun. Therefore the distance between the earth and the moon would be about 95,000,000 miles. So if a space capsule were traveling at the speed of 18,000 miles per hour, how could it reach the moon in four days? At that speed, going to the moon would take at least seven months. That a space capsule on a moon excursion has reached the moon in four days is therefore impossible.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Having been graced by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demigods began fighting the demons again, with renewed energy. King Indra released his thunderbolt against Bali, and when Bali fell, his friend Jambh&#257;sura attacked Indra, who then cut off Jambh&#257;sura&rsquo;s head with his thunderbolt. When N&#257;rada Muni learned that Jambh&#257;sura had been killed, he informed Jambh&#257;sura&rsquo;s relatives Namuci, Bala and P&#257;ka, who then went to the battlefield and attacked the demigods. Indra, King of heaven, severed the heads of Bala and P&#257;ka and released the weapon known as <span class="Italic">kuli&#347;a,</span> the thunderbolt, against Namuci&rsquo;s shoulder. The thunderbolt, however, returned unsuccessful, and thus Indra became morose. At that time, an unseen voice came from the sky. The voice declared, &ldquo;A dry or wet weapon cannot kill Namuci.&rdquo; Hearing this voice, Indra began to think of how Namuci could be killed. He then thought of foam, which is neither moist nor dry. Using a weapon of foam, he was able to kill Namuci. Thus Indra and the other demigods killed many demons. Then, at the request of Lord Brahm&#257;, N&#257;rada went to the demigods and forbade them to kill the demons any longer. All the demigods then returned to their abodes. Following the instructions of N&#257;rada, whatever demons remained alive on the battlefield took Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja to Asta Mountain. There, by the touch of &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya&rsquo;s hand, Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja regained his senses and consciousness, and those demons whose heads and bodies had not been completely lost were brought back to life by the mystic power of &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya.</div>

Nonetheless, Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja challenged Indra by saying that Indra was not a very learned person. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index7871.html?g=483">2.11</a>) K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a rebuked Arjuna by saying:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">a&#347;ocy&#257;n anva&#347;ocas tva&#7745;<br>praj&ntilde;&#257;-v&#257;d&#257;&#7745;&#347; ca bh&#257;&#7779;ase<br>gat&#257;s&#363;n agat&#257;s&#363;&#7745;&#347; ca<br>n&#257;nu&#347;ocanti pa&#7751;&#7693;it&#257;&#7717;</div>
</div><A NAME="101981"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;While speaking learned words, you are mourning for what is not worthy of grief. Those who are wise lament neither for the living nor the dead.&rdquo; Thus as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a challenged Arjuna by saying that he was not a <span class="Italic">pa&#7751;&#7693;ita,</span> or a learned person, Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja also challenged King Indra and his associates. In this material world, everything happens under the influence of time. Consequently, for a learned person who sees how things are taking place, there is no question of being sorry or happy because of the waves of material nature. After all, since we are being carried away by these waves, what is the meaning of being jubilant or morose? One who is fully conversant with the laws of nature is never jubilant or morose because of nature&rsquo;s activities. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexdd6f.html?g=511">2.14</a>), K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a advises that one be tolerant: <span class="Italic">t&#257;&#7745;s titik&#7779;asva bh&#257;rata.</span> Following this advice of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s, one should not be morose or unhappy because of circumstantial changes. This is the symptom of a devotee. A devotee carries out his duty in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness and is never unhappy in awkward circumstances. He has full faith that in such circumstances, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a protects His devotee. Therefore a devotee never deviates from his prescribed duty of devotional service.

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This chapter describes how Lord &#346;iva was bewildered upon seeing the beautiful Mohin&#299;-m&#363;rti incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and how he later came to his senses. When Lord &#346;iva heard about the pastimes performed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, in the form of an attractive woman, he mounted his bull and went to see the Lord. Accompanied by his wife, Um&#257;, and his servants, the <span class="Italic">bh&#363;ta-ga&#7751;a,</span> or ghosts, he approached the lotus feet of the Lord. Lord &#346;iva offered obeisances to the Supreme Lord as the all-pervading Lord, the universal form, the supreme controller of creation, the Supersoul, the resting place for everyone, and the completely independent cause of all causes. Thus he offered prayers giving truthful descriptions of the Lord. Then he expressed his desire. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is very kind to His devotees. Therefore, to fulfill the desire of His devotee Lord &#346;iva, He expanded His energy and manifested Himself in the form of a very beautiful and attractive woman. Upon seeing this form, even Lord &#346;iva was captivated. Later, by the grace of the Lord, he controlled himself. This demonstrates that by the power of the Lord&rsquo;s external energy, everyone is captivated by the form of woman in this material world. Again, however, by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can overcome the influence of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> This was evinced by Lord &#346;iva, the topmost devotee of the Lord. First he was captivated, but later, by the grace of the Lord, he restrained himself. It is declared in this connection that only a pure devotee can restrain himself from the attractive feature of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> Otherwise, once a living entity is trapped by the external feature of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> he cannot overcome it. After Lord &#346;iva was graced by the Supreme Lord, he circumambulated the Lord along with his wife, Bhav&#257;n&#299;, and his companions, the ghosts. Then he left for his own abode. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; concludes this chapter by describing the transcendental qualities of Uttama&#347;loka, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and by declaring that one can glorify the Lord by nine kinds of devotional service, beginning with <span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;a&#7745; k&#299;rtana&#7745;</span></div>

Indeed, because the Lord is differently situated from everything material, He is the Supreme Brahman, the supreme cause, the supreme controller. <span class="Italic">&#298;&#347;vara&#7717; parama&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&#7717; sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha&#7717; </I>[</I>Bs. </span>5.1</I>]</I><span class="Italic">.</span> The Lord is the supreme cause, and His form has nothing to do with the material modes of nature. The devotee prays: &ldquo;As Your devotee is completely free from all desires, Your Lordship is also completely free from desires. You are fully independent. Although all living entities engage in Your service, You do not depend on the service of anyone. Although this material world is created complete by You, everything depends on Your sanction. As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> <span class="Italic">matta&#7717; sm&#7771;tir j&ntilde;&#257;nam apohana&#7745; ca:</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a></I>]</I> remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness come from You. Nothing can be done independently, yet You act independently of the service rendered by Your servants. The living entities depend on Your mercy for liberation, but when You want to give them liberation, You do not depend on anyone else. Indeed, by Your causeless mercy, You can give liberation to anyone. Those who receive Your mercy are called <span class="Italic">k&#7771;p&#257;-siddha.</span> To reach the platform of perfection takes many, many lives (<span class="Italic">bah&#363;n&#257;&#7745; janman&#257;m ante j&ntilde;&#257;nav&#257;n m&#257;&#7745; prapadyate</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index4112.html?g=2631">7.19</a>]). Nonetheless, even without undergoing severe austerities, one can attain perfection by Your mercy. Devotional service should be unmotivated and free from impediments (<span class="Italic">ahaituky apratihat&#257; yay&#257;tm&#257; supras&#299;dati</span>). This is the position of <span class="Italic">nir&#257;&#347;i&#7779;a&#7717;,</span> or freedom from expectations for results. A pure devotee continuously offers transcendental loving service to You, but You may nonetheless offer mercy to anyone, without depending on his service.&rdquo;</div>

<div class="Translation">My dear Lord, Your Lordship alone is the cause and the effect. Therefore, although You appear to be two, You are the absolute one. As there is no difference between the gold of a golden ornament and the gold in a mine, there is no difference between cause and effect; both of them are the same. Only because of ignorance do people concoct differences and dualities. You are free from material contamination, and since the entire cosmos is caused by You and cannot exist without You, it is an effect of Your transcendental qualities. Thus the conception that Brahman is true and the world false cannot be maintained.</div>

<div class="First">&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura says that the living entities are representations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead&rsquo;s marginal potency whereas the various bodies accepted by the living entities are products of the material energy. Thus the body is considered material, and the soul is considered spiritual. The origin of them both, however, is the same Supreme Personality of Godhead. As the Lord explains in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index7379.html?g=2496">7.4</a>&ndash;5):</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego&mdash;all together these eight comprise My separated material energies. But besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine, which consists of all living entities who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe.&rdquo; Thus both matter and the living entities are manifestations of energy of the Supreme Lord. Since the energy and the energetic are not different and since the material and marginal energies are both energies of the supreme energetic, the Supreme Lord, ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead is everything. In this regard, the example may be given of gold that has not been molded and gold that has been molded into various ornaments. A gold earring and the gold in a mine are different only as cause and effect; otherwise they are the same. The <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra</span> describes that Brahman is the cause of everything. <span class="Italic">Janm&#257;dy asya yata&#7717;</I> [SB </I><a href="index4dab.html?g=6120">1.1.1</a></I>]</I>.</span> Everything is born of the Supreme Brahman, from which everything emanates as different energies.

The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s&rsquo; differentiation between Brahman and <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> is only due to ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299;mad V&#299;rar&#257;ghava &#256;c&#257;rya, in his <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata-candra-candrik&#257;,</span> describes the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava philosophy as follows. The cosmic manifestation is described as <span class="Italic">sat</span> and <span class="Italic">asat,</span> as <span class="Italic">cit</span> and <span class="Italic">acit.</span> Matter is <span class="Italic">acit,</span> and the living force is <span class="Italic">cit,</span> but their origin is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in whom there is no difference between matter and spirit. According to this conception, the cosmic manifestation, consisting of both matter and spirit, is not different from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">Ida&#7745; hi vi&#347;va&#7745; bhagav&#257;n ivetara&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;This cosmic manifestation is also the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although it appears different from Him.&rdquo; In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexa3fb.html?g=3021">9.4</a>) the Lord says:</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them.&rdquo; Thus although someone may say that the Supreme Person is different from the cosmic manifestation, actually He is not. The Lord says, <span class="Italic">may&#257; tatam ida&#7745; sarvam:</span> &ldquo;In My impersonal feature I am spread throughout the world.&rdquo; Therefore, this world is not different from Him. The difference is a difference in names. For example, whether we speak of gold earrings, gold bangles or gold necklaces, ultimately they are all gold. In a similar way, all the different manifestations of matter and spirit are ultimately one in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">ekam ev&#257;dvit&#299;ya&#7745; brahma.</span> This is the Vedic version (<span class="Ref_Italic">Ch&#257;ndogya Upani&#7779;ad</span> 6.2.1). There is oneness because everything emanates from the Supreme Brahman. The example already given is that there is no difference between a golden earring and the gold mine as it is. The Vai&#347;e&#7779;ika philosophers, however, because of their M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da conception, create differences. They say, <span class="Italic">brahma satya&#7745; jagan mithy&#257;:</span> &ldquo;The Absolute Truth is real, and the cosmic manifestation is false.&rdquo; But why should the <span class="Italic">jagat</span> be considered <span class="Italic">mithy&#257;</span>? The <span class="Italic">jagat</span> is an emanation from Brahman. Therefore the <span class="Italic">jagat</span> is also truth.</div>
<div class="Purport">Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas, therefore, do not consider the <span class="Italic">jagat</span> to be <span class="Italic">mithy&#257;;</span> rather, they regard everything as reality in connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

Actually, everything is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore everything is spiritual, but those who are not advanced in proper knowledge make distinctions because of the interactions of the three modes of material nature. In this regard, &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; says that although the sun is the only light, the sunshine, which is exhibited in seven colors, and darkness, which is the absence of sunshine, are not different from the sun, for without the existence of the sun such differentiations cannot exist. There may be varied nomenclature because of different conditions, but they are all the sun. The <span class="Italic">pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> therefore say:</div>

Similarly, <span class="Italic">sarva&#7745; khalv ida&#7745; brahma:</span> everything is an expansion of the Supreme Brahman. Therefore, the Supreme Lord is everything, and He is one without differentiation. There is no existence separate from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="First">When the Supreme Personality of Godhead assumed the form of the beautiful woman Mohin&#299;-m&#363;rti, the demons were certainly captivated, but the demigods present were not. In other words, those who maintain a demoniac mentality are bewildered by the beauty of a woman, but those who are advanced in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, or even those on the platform of goodness, are not bewildered. The Supreme Personality of Godhead knew that because Lord &#346;iva is not an ordinary person, he cannot be bewildered even by the most beautiful woman. Cupid himself tried to invoke Lord &#346;iva&rsquo;s lusty desires in the presence of P&#257;rvat&#299;, but Lord &#346;iva was never agitated. Rather, the blazing fire from Lord &#346;iva&rsquo;s eyes turned Cupid to ashes. Therefore, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u had to think twice about what kind of beautiful form would bewilder even Lord &#346;iva. Consequently He was smiling gravely, as stated in the previous verse (<span class="Italic">prahasya bh&#257;va-gambh&#299;ram</span>).

<div class="First">Lord &#346;iva&rsquo;s desiring to see Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u reveal the most attractive and beautiful form of a woman was certainly a joking affair. Lord &#346;iva knew that he could not be agitated by any so-called beautiful woman. &ldquo;The Daityas may have been bewildered,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;but since even the demigods could not be agitated, what to speak of me, who am the best of all the demigods?&rdquo; However, because Lord &#346;iva wanted to see Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&rsquo;s form as a woman, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u decided to impersonate a woman and show him a form that would immediately put him in an ocean of lusty desires.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The material bondage of this world is that a beautiful woman can captivate a handsome man and that a handsome man can captivate a beautiful woman. Such are the affairs that began when Lord &#346;iva observed the beautiful girl playing with the ball. In such activities, the influence of Cupid is very prominent. As both parties move their eyebrows and glance at one another, their lusty desires increase more and more. Such reciprocations of lusty desire took place between Lord &#346;iva and the beautiful woman, even though Um&#257; and Lord &#346;iva&rsquo;s associates were by Lord &#346;iva&rsquo;s side. Such is the attraction between man and woman in the material world. Lord &#346;iva was supposed to be above all this attraction, but he was victimized by the captivating power of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva thus explains the nature of lusty attraction:</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;The attraction between male and female is the basic principle of material existence. On the basis of this misconception, which ties together the hearts of the male and female, one becomes attracted to his body, home, property, children, relatives and wealth.

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all.

A person cares for his children not because of partiality but in a reciprocation of love. The children depend on the father&rsquo;s affection, and the father affectionately maintains the children. Similarly, because devotees do not know anything but the lotus feet of the Lord, the Lord is always prepared to give protection to His devotees and fulfill their desires. He therefore says, <span class="Italic">kaunteya pratij&#257;n&#299;hi na me bhakta&#7717; pra&#7751;a&#347;yati:</span> &ldquo;O son of Kunt&#299;, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes.&rdquo;</div>

<div class="First">In this verse, the words <span class="Italic">dharma&#7717;</span> and <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana&#7717;</span> are very important. <span class="Italic">San&#257;tana</span> means &ldquo;eternal,&rdquo; and <span class="Italic">dharma</span> means &ldquo;occupational duties.&rdquo; From Satya-yuga to Kali-yuga, the principles of religion and occupational duty gradually deteriorate. In Satya-yuga, the religious principles are observed in full, without deviation. In Tret&#257;-yuga, however, these principles are somewhat neglected, and only three fourths of the religious duties continue. In Dv&#257;para-yuga only half of the religious principles continue, and in Kali-yuga only one fourth of the religious principles, which gradually disappear. At the end of Kali-yuga, the principles of religion, or the occupational duties of humanity, are almost lost. Indeed, in this Kali-yuga we have passed through only five thousand years, yet the decline of <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana-dharma</span> is very prominent. The duty of saintly persons, therefore, is to take up seriously the cause of <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana-dharma</span> and try to reestablish it for the benefit of the entire human society. The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement has been started according to this principle. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (12.3.51):</div>

<div class="After-Verse">The entire Kali-yuga is full of faults. It is like an unlimited ocean of faults. But the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is very authorized.

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it wanted to understand how Lord V&#257;manadeva, on the plea of taking three paces of land from Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, took everything away from him and arrested him. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; responded to this inquiry with the following explanation. In the fight between the demons and the demigods, as described in the Eleventh Chapter of this canto, Bali was defeated, and he died in the fight, but by the grace of &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya he regained his life. Thus he engaged himself in the service of &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya, his spiritual master. The descendants of Bh&#7771;gu, being pleased with him, engaged him in the Vi&#347;vajit-yaj&ntilde;a. When this <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a</span> was performed, from the fire of <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a</span> came a chariot, horses, a flag, a bow, armor and two quivers of arrows. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Prahl&#257;da, Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s grandfather, gave Bali an eternal garland of flowers, and &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya gave him a conchshell. Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, after offering obeisances to Prahl&#257;da, the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and his spiritual master, &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya, equipped himself to fight with Indra and went to Indrapur&#299; with his soldiers. Blowing his conchshell, he attacked the outskirts of Indra&rsquo;s kingdom. When Indra saw Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s prowess, he went to his own spiritual master, B&#7771;haspati, told him about Bali&rsquo;s strength, and inquired about his duty. B&#7771;haspati informed the demigods that because Bali had been endowed with extraordinary power by the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> the demigods could not fight with him. Their only hope was to gain the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Indeed, there was no alternative. Under the circumstances, B&#7771;haspati advised the demigods to leave the heavenly planets and keep themselves somewhere invisible. The demigods followed his orders, and Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, along with his associates, gained the entire kingdom of Indra. The descendants of Bh&#7771;gu Muni, being very affectionate to their disciple Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, engaged him in performing one hundred <span class="Italic">a&#347;vamedha-yaj&ntilde;as.</span> In this way, Bali enjoyed the opulences of the heavenly planets.</div>

</div><A NAME="104181"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Since the demigods were not visible in the heavenly kingdom, their mother, Aditi, because of separation from them, was very much aggrieved. One day after many, many years, the great sage Ka&#347;yapa emerged from a trance of meditation and returned to his <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama.</span> He saw that the <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama</span> was no longer beautiful and that his wife was very morose. Everywhere in the <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama,</span> he saw signs of lamentation. The great sage therefore inquired from his wife about the well-being of the <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama</span> and asked her why she looked so morose. After Aditi informed Ka&#347;yapa Muni about the <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama&rsquo;s</span> well-being, she told him that she was lamenting for the absence of her sons. She then requested him to tell her how her sons could return and reoccupy their positions. She wanted all good fortune for her sons. Moved by Aditi&rsquo;s request, Ka&#347;yapa Muni instructed her in the philosophy of self-realization, the difference between matter and spirit, and how to be unaffected by material loss. But when he saw that Aditi was not satisfied even after he had given these instructions, he advised her to worship V&#257;sudeva, Jan&#257;rdana. He assured her that only Lord V&#257;sudeva could satisfy her and fulfill all her desires. When Aditi then expressed her desire to worship Lord V&#257;sudeva, Praj&#257;pati Ka&#347;yapa told her about a process of worship known as <span class="Italic">payo-vrata,</span> which is executed in twelve days. Lord Brahm&#257; had instructed him how to satisfy Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a by this process, and thus he advised his wife to observe this vow and its regulative principles.</div>

<div class="Translation">O my wife, who are very much attached to household life, if the principles of religion, economic development and satisfaction of the senses are properly followed in household life, one&rsquo;s activities are as good as those of a transcendentalist. I wonder whether there have been any discrepancies in following these principles.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In this verse, Aditi has been addressed by her husband, Ka&#347;yapa Muni, as <span class="Italic">g&#7771;ha-medhini,</span> which means &ldquo;one who is satisfied in household life for sense gratification.&rdquo; Generally, those who are in household life pursue sense gratification in the field of activities performed for material results. Such <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hamedh&#299;s</span> have only one aim in life&mdash;sense gratification. Therefore it is said, <span class="Italic">yan maithun&#257;di-g&#7771;hamedhi-sukha&#7745; hi tuccham:</I> [SB </span></I><a href="indexaa4a.html?g=57238">7.9.45</a>] the householder&rsquo;s life is based on sense gratification, and therefore the happiness derived from it is very meager. Nonetheless, the Vedic process is so comprehensive that even in householder life one can adjust his activities according to the regulative principles of <span class="Italic">dharma, artha, k&#257;ma</span> and <span class="Italic">mok&#7779;a.</span> One&rsquo;s aim should be to achieve liberation, but because one cannot at once give up sense gratification, in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> there are injunctions prescribing how to follow the principles of religion, economic development and sense gratification. As explained in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="index6973.html?g=6406">1.2.9</a>), <span class="Italic">dharmasya hy &#257;pavargyasya n&#257;rtho &rsquo;rth&#257;yopakalpate:</span> &ldquo;All occupational engagements are certainly meant for ultimate liberation. They should never be performed for material gain.&rdquo; Those who are in household life should not think that religion is meant to improve the process of the householder&rsquo;s sense gratification. Household life is also meant for advancement in spiritual understanding, by which one can ultimately gain liberation from the material clutches. One should remain in household life with the aim of understanding the ultimate goal of life (<span class="Italic">tattva jij&ntilde;&#257;s&#257;</span>). Then household life is as good as the life of a <span class="Italic">yogi.</span> Ka&#347;yapa Muni therefore inquired from his wife whether the principles of religion, economic development and sense gratification were being properly followed in terms of the &#347;&#257;stric injunctions. As soon as one deviates from the injunctions of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra,</span> the purpose of household life is immediately lost in confusion.</div>

<div class="Translation">Ka&#347;yapa Muni continued: What is this material body, made of five elements? It is different from the spirit soul. Indeed, the spirit soul is completely different from the material elements from which the body is made. But because of bodily attachment, one is regarded as a husband or son. These illusory relationships are caused by misunderstanding.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The spirit soul (<span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;</span> or <span class="Italic">j&#299;va</span>) is certainly different from the body, which is a combination of five material elements. This is a simple fact, but it is not understood unless one is spiritually educated. Ka&#347;yapa Muni met his wife, Aditi, in the heavenly planets, but the same misconception extends throughout the entire universe and is also here on earth. There are different grades of living entities, but all of them are more or less under the impression of the bodily conception of life. In other words, all living entities in this material world are more or less devoid of spiritual education. The Vedic civilization, however, is based on spiritual education, and spiritual education is the special basis on which <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> was spoken to Arjuna. In the beginning of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a instructed Arjuna to understand that the spirit soul is different from the body.</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">dehino &rsquo;smin yath&#257; dehe<br>kaum&#257;ra&#7745; yauvana&#7745; jar&#257;<br>tath&#257; deh&#257;ntara-pr&#257;ptir<br>dh&#299;ras tatra na muhyati</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.&rdquo; (Bg. <a href="indexf962.html?g=502">2.13</a>) Unfortunately, this spiritual education is completely absent from modern human civilization. No one understands his real self-interest, which lies with the spirit soul, not with the material body. Education means spiritual education. To work hard in the bodily conception of life, without spiritual education, is to live like an animal. <span class="Italic">N&#257;ya&#7745; deho deha-bh&#257;j&#257;&#7745; n&#7771;-loke ka&#7779;&#7789;&#257;n k&#257;m&#257;n arhate vid-bhuj&#257;&#7745; ye</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="index42d9.html?g=42737">5.5.1</a>). People are working so hard simply for bodily comforts, without education regarding the spirit soul. Thus they are living in a very risky civilization, for it is a fact that the spirit soul has to transmigrate from one body to another (<span class="Italic">tath&#257; deh&#257;ntara-pr&#257;pti&#7717;</span>). Without spiritual education, people are kept in dark ignorance and do not know what will happen to them after the annihilation of the present body. They are working blindly, and blind leaders are directing them. <span class="Italic">Andh&#257; yath&#257;ndhair upan&#299;yam&#257;n&#257;s te &rsquo;p&#299;&#347;a-tantry&#257;m uru-d&#257;mni baddh&#257;&#7717;</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="index2706.html?g=55424">7.5.31</a>). A foolish person does not know that he is completely under the bondage of material nature and that after death material nature will impose upon him a certain type of body, which he will have to accept. He does not know that although in his present body he may be a very important man, he may next get the body of an animal or tree because of his ignorant activities in the modes of material nature. Therefore the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is trying to give the true light of spiritual existence to all living entities. This movement is not very difficult to understand, and people must take advantage of it, for it will save them from the risky life of irresponsibility.</div>

<div class="First">With these words, Ka&#347;yapa Muni tried to pacify his wife. Aditi made her appeal to her material husband. Of course, that is nice, but actually a material relative cannot do anything good for anyone. If anything good can be done, it is done by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, V&#257;sudeva. Therefore, Ka&#347;yapa Muni advised his wife, Aditi, to begin worshiping Lord V&#257;sudeva, who is situated in everyone&rsquo;s heart. He is the friend of everyone and is known as Jan&#257;rdana because He can kill all enemies. There are three modes of material nature&mdash;goodness, passion and ignorance&mdash;and above material nature, transcendental to material nature, is another existence, which is called <span class="Italic">&#347;uddha-sattva.</span> In the material world, the mode of goodness is considered the best, but because of material contamination, even the mode of goodness is sometimes overpowered by the modes of passion and ignorance. But when one transcends the competition between these modes and engages himself in devotional service, he rises above the three modes of material nature. In that transcendental position, one is situated in pure consciousness. <span class="Italic">Sattva&#7745; vi&#347;uddha&#7745; vasudeva-&#347;abditam</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="indexd323.html?g=30357">4.3.23</a>). Above material nature is the position called <span class="Italic">vasudeva,</span> or freedom from material contamination. Only in that position can one perceive the Supreme Personality of Godhead, V&#257;sudeva.

Thus Ka&#347;yapa Muni was an ideal spiritual master. He was not so foolish that he would present himself as an exalted personality, as good as God. He was actually a bona fide <span class="Italic">guru</span> because he advised his wife to seek shelter at the lotus feet of V&#257;sudeva.

<div class="Purport">Ka&#347;yapa Muni saw that his wife, Aditi, had some material desires for the welfare of her sons, but still he advised her to render devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, everyone, regardless of whether he is a <span class="Italic">karm&#299;, j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;, yog&#299;</span> or <span class="Italic">bhakta,</span> should invariably take shelter of the lotus feet of V&#257;sudeva and render transcendental loving service unto Him so that all his desires will be duly fulfilled.

<div class="First">It is said, &ldquo;Man proposes, God disposes.&rdquo; Thus a person may desire many things, but unless these desires are fulfilled by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they cannot be fulfilled. Fulfillment of desire is called <span class="Italic">satya-sa&#7749;kalpa.</span> Here the word <span class="Italic">satya-sa&#7749;kalpa</span> is very important. Aditi placed herself at the mercy of her husband so that he would give her directions by which to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead so that all her desires would be fulfilled. A disciple must first decide that he should worship the Supreme Lord, and then the spiritual master will give the disciple correct directions. One cannot dictate to the spiritual master, just as a patient cannot demand that his physician prescribe a certain type of medicine. Here is the beginning of worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index3bf4.html?g=2604">7.16</a>):</div>

This is the bona fide Vedic system of receiving the process of devotional service, by which the Supreme Personality of Godhead is pleased. Therefore, to approach a bona fide <span class="Italic">guru,</span> or spiritual master, is essential.

Worshiping Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is the supreme process of worship. And how Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is worshiped in this <span class="Italic">payo-vrata</span> ceremony has now been fully described. The ultimate goal of life is to please Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u by <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma.</span> The Vedic principles of four <span class="Italic">var&#7751;as</span> and four <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;ramas</span> are meant for worship of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u (<span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;ur &#257;r&#257;dhyate pu&#7745;s&#257;&#7745; n&#257;nyat tat-to&#7779;a-k&#257;ra&#7751;am</span>). The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is also <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-&#257;r&#257;dhanam,</span> or worship of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, according to the age. The <span class="Italic">payo-vrata</span> method of <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-&#257;r&#257;dhanam</span> was enunciated long, long ago by Ka&#347;yapa Muni to his wife, Aditi, in the heavenly planets, and the same process is bona fide on earth even now. Especially for this age of Kali, the process accepted by the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is to open hundreds and thousands of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u temples (temples of R&#257;dh&#257;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Jagann&#257;tha, Balar&#257;ma, S&#299;t&#257;-R&#257;ma, Gaura-Nit&#257;i and so on). Performing prescribed worship in such temples of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and thus worshiping the Lord is as good as performing the <span class="Italic">payo-vrata</span> ceremony recommended here. The <span class="Italic">payo-vrata</span> ceremony is performed from the first to the thirteenth day of the bright fortnight of the moon, but in our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is worshiped in every temple according to a schedule of twenty-four hours of engagement in performing <span class="Italic">k&#299;rtana,</span> chanting the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra,</span> offering palatable food to Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and distributing this food to Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas and others. These are authorized activities, and if the members of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement stick to these principles, they will achieve the same result one gains by observing the <span class="Italic">payo-vrata</span> ceremony. Thus the essence of all auspicious activities, such as performing <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a,</span> giving in charity, observing <span class="Italic">vratas,</span> and undergoing austerities, is included in the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement. The members of this movement should immediately and sincerely follow the processes already recommended. Of course, sacrifice is meant to please Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. <span class="Italic">Yaj&ntilde;ai&#7717; sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana-pr&#257;yair yajanti hi sumedhasa&#7717;:</span></I> [SB </I>11.5.32</I>]</I> in Kali-yuga, those who are intelligent perform the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana-yaj&ntilde;a.</span> One should follow this process conscientiously.</div>

Aditi&rsquo;s throat was choked because of ecstatic feelings, and her entire body trembled with devotion. Although she wanted to offer suitable prayers to the Lord, she could not do anything, and thus she remained silent for some time. Then, feeling solace, observing the beauty of the Lord, she offered her prayers. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supersoul of all living entities, was very pleased with her, and He agreed to become her son by incarnating as a plenary expansion. He was already pleased by Ka&#347;yapa Muni&rsquo;s austerities, and thus He agreed to become their son and maintain the demigods. After giving His word of honor to this effect, the Lord disappeared.

<div class="Translation">O King, as the wind promotes friction between two pieces of wood and thus gives rise to fire, Ka&#347;yapa Muni, whose transcendental position was fully absorbed in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, transferred his potency into the womb of Aditi.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">A forest fire begins when two pieces of wood rub against one another, being agitated by the wind. Actually, however, fire belongs neither to the wood nor to the wind; it is always different from both. Similarly, here it is to be understood that the union of Ka&#347;yapa Muni and Aditi was not like the sexual intercourse of ordinary human beings. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has nothing to do with the human secretions of sexual intercourse. He is always completely aloof from such material combinations.</div>
<div class="Purport">The Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index90b5.html?g=3246">9.29</a>), <span class="Italic">samo &rsquo;ha&#7745; sarva-bh&#363;te&#7779;u:</span> &ldquo;I am equal toward all living entities.&rdquo; Nonetheless, to protect the devotees and kill the demons, who were a disturbing element, the Lord entered the womb of Aditi. Therefore this is a transcendental pastime of the Lord. This should not be misunderstood. One should not think that the Lord became the son of Aditi the way an ordinary child is born because of sexual intercourse between man and woman.</div>
<div class="Purport">Here it may also be appropriate to explain, in these days of controversy, the origin of life. The life force of the living entity&mdash;the soul&mdash;is different from the ovum and semen of the human being. Although the conditioned soul has nothing to do with the reproductive cells of man and woman, he is placed into the proper situation because of his work (<span class="Italic">karma&#7751;&#257; daiva-netre&#7751;a</span>). Life is not, however, a product of two secretions, but is independent of all material elements. As fully described in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> the living entity is not subject to any material reactions. He can neither be burnt by fire, cut by sharp weapons, moistened by water, nor dried by the air. He is completely different from the physical elements, but by a superior arrangement he is put into these material elements. He is always aloof from material contact (<span class="Italic">asa&#7749;go hy aya&#7745; puru&#7779;a&#7717;</span>) but because he is placed in a material condition, he suffers the reactions of the material modes of nature.</div>

Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u appeared at an auspicious moment on &#346;rava&#7751;a-dv&#257;da&#347;&#299; when the Abhijit star had arisen. At that time, in all the three worlds (including the higher planetary system, outer space and this earth), all the demigods, the cows, the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and even the seasons were happy because of God&rsquo;s appearance. Therefore this auspicious day is called Vijay&#257;. When the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has a <span class="Italic">sac-cid-&#257;nanda</span> body, appeared as the son of Ka&#347;yapa and Aditi, both of His parents were very astonished. After His appearance, the Lord assumed the form of a dwarf (V&#257;mana). All the great sages expressed their jubilation, and with Ka&#347;yapa Muni before them they performed the birthday ceremony of Lord V&#257;mana. At the time of Lord V&#257;manadeva&rsquo;s sacred thread ceremony, He was honored by the sun-god, B&#7771;haspati, the goddess presiding over the planet earth, the deity of the heavenly planets, His mother, Lord Brahm&#257;, Kuvera, the seven <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is</span> and others.

Because of His transcendentally effulgent presence, all the priests were diminished in their prowess, and thus they all stood from their seats and offered prayers to Lord V&#257;manadeva. Even Lord &#346;iva accepts on his head the Ganges water generated from the toe of Lord V&#257;manadeva. Therefore, after washing the Lord&rsquo;s feet, Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja immediately accepted the water from the Lord&rsquo;s feet on his head and felt that he and his predecessors had certainly been glorified. Then Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja inquired of Lord V&#257;manadeva&rsquo;s welfare and requested the Lord to ask him for money, jewels or anything He might desire.</div>

Therefore, according to the Vedic version, the modern astronomer&rsquo;s proposition that the moon is nearest to the earth should not be accepted. The chronological order in which people all over the world refer to the days of the week&mdash;Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday&mdash;corresponds to the Vedic order of the planets and thus circumstantiates the Vedic version. Apart from this, when the Lord appeared the planets and stars became situated very auspiciously, according to astrological calculations, to celebrate the birth of the Lord.</div>

Nonetheless, although He appears in various incarnations, they are not different from one another. He is the same person, with the same potency, the same eternity and the same spiritual existence, but He can simultaneously assume various forms. When V&#257;manadeva appeared from the womb of His mother, He appeared in the form of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, with four hands equipped with the necessary symbolic weapons, and then immediately transformed Himself into a <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> (<span class="Italic">va&#7789;u</span>).

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Atheists generally follow the Bauddha philosophical conclusion that at death everything is finished. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, being an atheist, thought this way. Because Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u was not visible to him, he thought that the Lord was dead. Even today, many people follow the philosophy that God is dead. But God is never dead. Even the living entity, who is part of God, never dies. <span class="Italic">Na j&#257;yate mriyate v&#257; kad&#257;cit:</span> &ldquo;For the soul there is never birth or death.&rdquo; This is the statement of <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexd7ba.html?g=565">2.20</a>). Even the ordinary living entity never takes birth or dies. What then is to be said of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the chief of all living entities? He certainly never takes birth or dies. <span class="Italic">Ajo&rsquo;pi sann avyay&#257;tm&#257;</span> (Bg. <a href="index333e.html?g=1478">4.6</a>).

<div class="Purport">As indicated by the words <span class="Italic">yato n&#257;vartate pum&#257;n,</span> there is certainly a spiritual kingdom, and if the living entity goes there, he never returns to this material world. This is also confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexe89d.html?g=1505">4.9</a>): <span class="Italic">tyaktv&#257; deha&#7745; punar janma naiti m&#257;m eti so&rsquo;rjuna.</span> Materially speaking, every living entity dies; death is inevitable.

In the material world, all distresses are due to extravagance. One acquires money extravagantly and also spends it extravagantly. Such activities are sinful. All property belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and all living beings, who are sons of the Supreme Lord, have the right to use the Supreme Father&rsquo;s property, but one cannot take more than necessary.

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">The Personality of Godhead said: O my dear King, even the entirety of whatever there may be within the three worlds to satisfy one&rsquo;s senses cannot satisfy a person whose senses are uncontrolled.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The material world is an illusory energy to deviate the living entities from the path of self-realization. Anyone who is in this material world is extremely anxious to get more and more things for sense gratification. Actually, however, the purpose of life is not sense gratification but self-realization. Therefore, those who are too addicted to sense gratification are advised to practice the mystic <span class="Italic">yoga</span> system, or <span class="Italic">a&#7779;&#7789;&#257;&#7749;ga-yoga</span> system, consisting of <span class="Italic">yama, niyama, &#257;sana, pr&#257;&#7751;&#257;y&#257;ma, praty&#257;h&#257;ra</span> and so on. In this way, one can control the senses. The purpose of controlling the senses is to stop one&rsquo;s implication in the cycle of birth and death. As stated by &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">n&#363;na&#7745; pramatta&#7717; kurute vikarma<br>yad indriya-pr&#299;taya &#257;p&#7771;&#7751;oti<br>na s&#257;dhu manye yata &#257;tmano &rsquo;yam<br>asann api kle&#347;ada &#257;sa deha&#7717;<br><span class="Italic"></I> [SB </span></I><a href="index404a.html?g=42765">5.5.4</a></I>]</I></div>
</div><A NAME="106052"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;When a person considers sense gratification the aim of life, he certainly becomes mad after materialistic living and engages in all kinds of sinful activity. He does not know that due to his past misdeeds he has already received a body which, although temporary, is the cause of his misery. Actually the living entity should not have taken on a material body, but he has been awarded the material body for sense gratification. Therefore I think it not befitting an intelligent man to involve himself again in the activities of sense gratification, by which he perpetually gets material bodies one after another.&rdquo; (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="index404a.html?g=42765">5.5.4</a>) Thus according to &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva the human beings in this material world are just like madmen engaged in activities which they should not perform but which they do perform only for sense gratification. Such activities are not good because in this way one creates another body for his next life, as punishment for his nefarious activities. And as soon as he gets another material body, he is put into repeated suffering in material existence. Therefore the Vedic culture or brahminical culture teaches one how to be satisfied with possessing the minimum necessities in life.</div>
<div class="Purport">To teach this highest culture, <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> is recommended. The aim of the <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</span> divisions&mdash;<span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a, k&#7779;atriya, vai&#347;ya, &#347;&#363;dra, brahmacarya, g&#7771;hastha, v&#257;naprastha</span> and <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span>&mdash;is to train one to control the senses and be content with the bare necessities. Here Lord V&#257;manadeva, as an ideal <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;,</span> refuses Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s offer to give Him anything He might want. He says that without contentment one could not be happy even if he possessed the property of the entire world or the entire universe. In human society, therefore, the brahminical culture, <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> culture and <span class="Italic">vai&#347;ya</span> culture must be maintained, and people must be taught how to be satisfied with only what they need. In modern civilization there is no such education; everyone tries to possess more and more, and everyone is dissatisfied and unhappy. The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is therefore establishing various farms, especially in America, to show how to be happy and content with minimum necessities of life and to save time for self-realization, which one can very easily achieve by chanting the <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra</span>&mdash;Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare Hare/ Hare R&#257;ma, Hare R&#257;ma, R&#257;ma R&#257;ma, Hare Hare.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;In the spiritually joyous state, one is situated in boundless transcendental happiness and enjoys himself through transcendental senses. Established thus, one never departs from the truth.&rdquo; One has to perceive happiness by the supersenses. The supersenses are not the senses of the material elements. Every one of us is a spiritual being (<span class="Italic">aha&#7745; brahm&#257;smi</span>), and every one of us is an individual person. Our senses are now covered by material elements, and because of ignorance we consider the material senses that cover us to be our real senses. The real senses, however, are within the material covering. <span class="Italic">Dehino&rsquo;smin yath&#257; dehe:</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexf962.html?g=502">2.13</a></I><span class="Italic">]</I></span> within the covering of the material elements are the spiritual senses. <span class="Italic">Sarvop&#257;dhi-vinirmukta&#7745; tat-paratvena nirmalam:</I></span> [Cc. Madhya </I><a href="index663c.html?g=124289">19.170</a></I>]</I> when the spiritual senses are uncovered, by these senses we can be happy. Satisfaction of the spiritual senses is thus described: <span class="Italic">h&#7771;&#7779;&#299;ke&#7751;a h&#7771;&#7779;&#299;ke&#347;a-sevana&#7745; bhaktir ucyate.</span> When the senses are engaged in devotional service to H&#7771;&#7779;&#299;ke&#347;a, then the senses are completely satisfied. Without this superior knowledge of sense gratification, one may try to satisfy his material senses, but happiness will never be possible. One may increase his ambition for sense gratification and even achieve what he desires for the gratification of his senses, but because this is on the material platform, he will never achieve satisfaction and contentment.</div>
<div class="Purport">According to brahminical culture, one should be content with whatever he obtains without special endeavor and should cultivate spiritual consciousness. Then he will be happy. The purpose of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is to spread this understanding. People who do not have scientific spiritual knowledge mistakenly think that the members of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement are escapists trying to avoid material activities. In fact, however, we are engaged in real activities for obtaining the ultimate happiness in life. If one is not trained to satisfy the spiritual senses and continues in material sense gratification, he will never obtain happiness that is eternal and blissful. <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="index42d9.html?g=42737">5.5.1</a>) therefore recommends:</div>

<div class="First">&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura explains in this regard that the very word <span class="Italic">hari&#7717;</span> means &ldquo;one who takes away.&rdquo; If one connects himself with Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord takes away all his miseries, and in the beginning the Lord also superficially appears to take away all his material possessions, reputation, education and beauty. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (10.88.8), <span class="Italic">yasy&#257;ham anug&#7771;h&#7751;&#257;mi hari&#7779;ye tad-dhana&#7745; &#347;anai&#7717;.</span> The Lord said to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, &ldquo;The first installment of My mercy toward a devotee is that I take away all his possessions, especially his material opulence, his money.&rdquo; This is the special favor of the Lord toward a sincere devotee. If a sincere devotee wants K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a above everything but at the same time is attached to material possessions, which hinder his advancement in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, by tactics the Lord takes away all his possessions. Here &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya says that this dwarf <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> would take away everything. Thus he indicates that the Lord will take away all one&rsquo;s material possessions and also one&rsquo;s mind. If one delivers his mind to the lotus feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (<span class="Italic">sa vai mana&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-pad&#257;ravindayo&#7717;</span>), one can naturally sacrifice everything to satisfy Him. Although Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was a devotee, he was attached to material possessions, and therefore the Lord, being very kind to him, showed him special favor by appearing as Lord V&#257;mana to take away all his material possessions, and his mind as well.</div>

<div class="Translation">The Vedas enjoin that the factual result of the tree of the body is the good fruits and flowers derived from it.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This <span class="Italic">&#347;loka</span> explains that in relation to the material body even the factual truth cannot exist without a touch of untruth.

Even if for the sake of argument the material world is accepted as untruth, the living entity entangled in the illusory energy cannot come out of it without the help of the body. Without the help of the body, one cannot follow a system of religion, nor can one speculate on philosophical perfection. Therefore, the flower and fruit (<span class="Italic">pu&#7779;pa-phalam</span>) have to be obtained as a result of the body. Without the help of the body, that fruit cannot be gained. The Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava philosophy therefore recommends <span class="Italic">yukta-vair&#257;gya.</span> It is not that all attention should be diverted for the maintenance of the body, but at the same time one&rsquo;s bodily maintenance should not be neglected. As long as the body exists one can thoroughly study the Vedic instructions, and thus at the end of life one can achieve perfection.

<div class="First">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bali wanted to give everything to V&#257;manadeva, who had appeared as a beggar, but &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya, being Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bali&rsquo;s familial spiritual master in the line of seminal succession, could not appreciate Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bali&rsquo;s promise. &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya gave Vedic evidence that one should not give everything to a poor man. Rather, when a poor man comes for charity one should untruthfully say, &ldquo;Whatever I have I have given you. I have no more.&rdquo; It is not that one should give everything to him. Actually the word <span class="Italic">o&#7745;</span> is meant for <span class="Italic">o&#7745; tat sat,</span> the Absolute Truth. <span class="Italic">O&#7745;k&#257;ra</span> is meant for freedom from all attachment to money because money should be spent for the purpose of the Supreme. The tendency of modern civilization is to give money in charity to the poor. Such charity has no spiritual value because we actually see that although there are so many hospitals and other foundations and institutions for the poor, according to the three modes of material nature a class of poor men is always destined to continue. Even though there are so many charitable institutions, poverty has not been driven from human society. Therefore it is recommended here, <span class="Italic">bhik&#7779;ave sarvam o&#7745; kurvan n&#257;la&#7745; k&#257;mena c&#257;tmane.</span> One should not give everything to the beggars among the poor.</div>
<div class="Purport">The best solution is that of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement. This movement is always kind to the poor, not only because it feeds them but also because it gives them enlightenment by teaching them how to become K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious. We are therefore opening hundreds and thousands of centers for those who are poor, both in money and in knowledge, to enlighten them in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness and reform their character by teaching them how to avoid illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling, which are the most sinful activities and which cause people to suffer, life after life. The best way to use money is to open such a center, where all may come live and reform their character. They may live very comfortably, without denial of any of the body&rsquo;s necessities, but they live under spiritual control, and thus they live happily and save time for advancement in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. If one has money, it should not be squandered away on nothing. It should be used to push forward the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement so that all of human society will become happy, prosperous and hopeful of being promoted back home, back to Godhead. The Vedic <span class="Italic">mantra</span> in this regard reads as follows:</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The summary of this Twentieth Chapter is as follows. Despite his knowledge that Lord V&#257;manadeva was cheating him, Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja gave everything to the Lord in charity, and thus the Lord extended His body and assumed a gigantic form as Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u.</div>
</div><A NAME="106360"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">After hearing the instructive advice of &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya, Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja became contemplative. Because it is the duty of a householder to maintain the principles of religion, economic development and sense gratification, Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja thought it improper to withdraw his promise to the <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;.</span> To lie or fail to honor a promise given to a <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> is never proper, for lying is the most sinful activity. Everyone should be afraid of the sinful reactions to lying, for mother earth cannot even bear the weight of a sinful liar. The spreading of a kingdom or empire is temporary; if there is no benefit for the general public, such expansion has no value. Previously, all the great kings and emperors expanded their kingdoms with a regard for the welfare of the people in general. Indeed, while engaged in such activities for the benefit of the general public, eminent men sometimes even sacrificed their lives. It is said that one who is glorious in his activities is always living and never dies. Therefore, fame should be the aim of life, and even if one becomes poverty-stricken for the sake of a good reputation, that is not a loss. Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja thought that even if this <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;,</span> V&#257;manadeva, were Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, if the Lord accepted his charity and then again arrested him, Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja would not envy Him. Considering all these points, Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja finally gave in charity everything he possessed.</div>
</div><A NAME="106361"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Lord V&#257;manadeva then immediately extended Himself into a universal body. By the mercy of Lord V&#257;manadeva, Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja could see that the Lord is all-pervading and that everything rests in His body. Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja could see Lord V&#257;manadeva as the supreme Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, wearing a helmet, yellow garments, the mark of &#346;r&#299;vatsa, the Kaustubha jewel, a flower garland, and ornaments decorating His entire body. The Lord gradually covered the entire surface of the world, and by extending His body He covered the entire sky. With His hands He covered all directions, and with His second footstep He covered the entire upper planetary system. Therefore there was no vacant place where He could take His third footstep.</div>

How could he disobey the instruction of &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya, his spiritual master? It is the duty of such a sober personality as Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja to abide by the orders of his spiritual master immediately, as his spiritual master had advised. But Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja also considered that &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya was no longer to be accepted as a spiritual master, for he had deviated from the duty of a spiritual master. According to <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra,</span> the duty of the <span class="Italic">guru</span> is to take the disciple back home, back to Godhead. If he is unable to do so and instead hinders the disciple in going back to Godhead, he should not be a <span class="Italic">guru.</span> <span class="Italic">Gurur na sa sy&#257;t</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="index65b1.html?g=42877">5.5.18</a>). One should not become a <span class="Italic">guru</span> if he cannot enable his disciple to advance in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. The goal of life is to become a devotee of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a so that one may be freed from the bondage of material existence (<span class="Italic">tyaktv&#257; deha&#7745; punar janma naiti mam eti so &rsquo;rjuna</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexe89d.html?g=1505">4.9</a>]). The spiritual master helps the disciple attain this stage by developing K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. Now &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya has advised Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja to deny the promise to V&#257;manadeva. Under the circumstances, therefore, Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja thought that there would be no fault if he disobeyed the order of his spiritual master.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s grave answer to &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya is meaningful. &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya stressed that one&rsquo;s material means of livelihood and one&rsquo;s material reputation, sense gratification and economic development must continue properly. To see to this is the first duty of a man who is a householder, especially one who is interested in material affairs. If a religious principle does not affect one&rsquo;s material condition, it is to be accepted. At the present time, in this age of Kali, this idea is extremely prominent. No one is prepared to accept any religious principle if it hampers material prosperity. &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya, being a person of this material world, did not know the principles of a devotee. A devotee is determined to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead to His full satisfaction. Anything that hampers such determination should certainly be rejected. This is the principle of <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> <span class="Italic">&#256;nuk&#363;lyasya sa&#7749;kalpa&#7717; pr&#257;tik&#363;lyasya varjanam</span> (Cc. <span class="Ref_Italic">Madhya</span> <a href="indexf22c.html?g=129423">22.100</a>). To perform devotional service, one must accept only that which is favorable and reject that which is unfavorable. Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja had the opportunity to contribute everything he possessed to the lotus feet of Lord V&#257;manadeva, but &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya was putting forward a material argument to hamper this process of devotional service. Under the circumstances, Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja decided that such hindrances should certainly be avoided. In other words, he decided immediately to reject the advice of &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya and go on with his duty. Thus he gave all his possessions to Lord V&#257;manadeva.</div>

Although the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> were very learned and advanced in Vedic knowledge, they could not achieve the mercy of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-Balar&#257;ma, whereas their wives achieved complete perfection in devotional service, despite their being women. Similarly, Vairocani, Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, received the mercy of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, and by Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s mercy he also received the mercy of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, who appeared before him as a <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> beggar. Thus Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja became a <span class="Italic">k&#7771;p&#257;-siddha</span> because of the special mercy of both <span class="Italic">guru</span> and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu confirms this favor: <span class="Italic">guru-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-pras&#257;de p&#257;ya bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja</span> (Cc. <span class="Ref_Italic">Madhya</span> <a href="index9884.html?g=124149">19.151</a>). Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, by the grace of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, got the seed of devotional service, and when that seed developed, he achieved the ultimate fruit of that service, namely love of Godhead (<span class="Italic">prem&#257; pum-artho mah&#257;n</span>), immediately upon the appearance of Lord V&#257;manadeva. Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja regularly maintained devotion for the Lord, and because he was purified, the Lord appeared before him. Because of unalloyed love for the Lord, he then immediately decided, &ldquo;I shall give this little dwarf <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> whatever He asks from me.&rdquo; This is a sign of love. Thus Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja is understood to be one who received the highest perfection of devotional service by special mercy.</div>

<div class="Translation">Dadh&#299;ci, &#346;ibi and many other great personalities were willing to sacrifice even their lives for the benefit of the people in general. This is the evidence of history. So why not give up this insignificant land? What is the serious consideration against it?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was prepared to give everything to Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya, being a professional priest, might have been anxiously waiting, doubting whether there had been any such instance in history in which one had given everything in charity. Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, however, cited the tangible examples of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#346;ibi and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Dadh&#299;ci, who had given up their lives for the benefit of the general public. Certainly one has attachment for everything material, especially one&rsquo;s land, but land and other possessions are forcibly taken away at the time of death, as stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">m&#7771;tyu&#7717; sarva-hara&#347; c&#257;ham</span>). The Lord personally appeared to Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja to take away everything he had, and thus he was so fortunate that he could see the Lord face to face. Nondevotees, however, cannot see the Lord face to face; to such persons the Lord appears as death and takes away all their possessions by force. Under the circumstances, why should we not part with our possessions and deliver them to Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u for His satisfaction? &#346;r&#299; C&#257;&#7751;akya Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita says in this regard, <span class="Italic">san-nimitte vara&#7745; ty&#257;go vin&#257;&#347;e niyate sati</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">C&#257;&#7751;akya-&#347;loka</span> 36). Since our money and possessions do not last but will somehow or other be taken away, as long as they are in our possession it is better to use them for charity to a noble cause. Therefore Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja defied the order of his so-called spiritual master.</div>

<div class="First">The difference between the behavior of Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and that of his spiritual master, &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya, was that Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja had already developed love of Godhead, whereas &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya, being merely a priest of routine rituals, had not. Thus &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya was never inspired by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to develop in devotional service. As stated by the Lord Himself in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index0c2e.html?g=3378">10.10</a>):</div>

<div class="Purport">Devotees who actually engage in devotional service with faith and love are inspired by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Such instructions are meant only for devotees. Therefore in this verse the word <span class="Italic">daiva-prahita&#7717;,</span> &ldquo;being inspired by the Supreme Lord,&rdquo; is important. &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya should have encouraged Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja to give everything to Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. This would have been a sign of love for the Supreme Lord. But he did not do so. On the contrary, he wanted to punish his devoted disciple by cursing him.</div>

<div class="Translation">The unlimited Supreme Personality of Godhead, who had assumed the form of V&#257;mana, then began increasing in size, acting in terms of the material energy, until everything in the universe was within His body, including the earth, the planetary systems, the sky, the directions, the various holes in the universe, the seas, the oceans, the birds, beasts, human beings, the demigods and the great saintly persons.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja wanted to give charity to V&#257;manadeva, but the Lord expanded His body in such a way that He showed Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja that everything in the universe is already in His body. Actually, no one can give anything to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for He is full in everything. Sometimes we see a devotee offering Ganges water to the Ganges. After taking his bath in the Ganges, a devotee takes a palmful of water and offers it back to the Ganges. Actually, when one takes a palmful of water from the Ganges, the Ganges does not lose anything, and similarly if a devotee offers a palmful of water to the Ganges, the Ganges does not increase in any way. But by such an offering, the devotee becomes celebrated as a devotee of mother Ganges. Similarly, when we offer anything with devotion and faith, what we offer does not belong to us, nor does it enrich the opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But if one offers whatever he has in his possession, he becomes a recognized devotee. In this regard, the example is given that when one&rsquo;s face is decorated with a garland and sandalwood pulp, the reflection of one&rsquo;s face in a mirror automatically becomes beautiful. The original source of everything is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is our original source also. Therefore when the Supreme Personality of Godhead is decorated, the devotees and all living entities are decorated automatically.</div>

<div class="Translation">My dear King, on the heart of Lord Mur&#257;ri he saw religion; on the chest, both pleasing words and truthfulness; in the mind, the moon; on the bosom, the goddess of fortune, with a lotus flower in her hand; on the neck, all the Vedas and all sound vibrations; on the arms, all the demigods, headed by King Indra; in both ears, all the directions; on the head, the upper planetary systems; on the hair, the clouds; in the nostrils, the wind; on the eyes, the sun; and in the mouth, fire. From His words came all the Vedic mantras, on His tongue was the demigod of water, Varu&#7751;adeva, on His eyebrows were the regulative principles, and on His eyelids were day and night. [When His eyes were open it was daytime, and when they were closed it was night.] On His forehead was anger, and on His lips was greed. O King, in His touch were lusty desires, in His semen were all the waters, on His back was irreligion, and in His wonderful activities or steps was the fire of sacrifice. On His shadow was death, in His smile was the illusory energy, and on the hairs of His body were all the drugs and herbs. In His veins were all the rivers, on His nails were all the stones, in His intelligence were Lord Brahm&#257;, the demigods and the great saintly persons, and throughout His entire body and senses were all living entities, moving and stationary. Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja thus saw everything in the gigantic body of the Lord.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">With the second step the Supreme Personality of Godhead reached the topmost planet of the universe, Brahmaloka, which He diminished in beauty by the effulgence of His toenails. Thus Lord Brahm&#257;, accompanied by great sages like Mar&#299;ci and the predominating deities of all the higher planets, offered humble prayers and worship to the Lord. They washed the Lord&rsquo;s feet and worshiped Him with all paraphernalia. &#7770;k&#7779;ar&#257;ja, J&#257;mbav&#257;n, played his bugle to vibrate the glories of the Lord. When Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was deprived of all his possessions, the demons were very angry. Although Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja warned them not to do so, they took up weapons against Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. All of them were defeated, however, by Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&rsquo;s eternal associates, and, in accordance with Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s order, they all entered the lower planets of the universe. Understanding Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&rsquo;s purpose, Garu&#7693;a, the carrier of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, immediately arrested Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja with the ropes of Varu&#7751;a. When Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was thus reduced to a helpless position, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u asked him for the third step of land. Because Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u appreciated Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s determination and integrity, when Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was unable to fulfill his promise, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u ascertained that the place for him would be the planet Sutala, which is better than the planets of heaven.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Among the great personalities who came to worship the lotus feet of the Lord were those who had attained perfection in self-control and regulative principles, as well as experts in logic, history, general education and the Vedic literature known as kalpe [dealing with old historical incidents]. Others were experts in the Vedic corollaries like Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;, all the other knowledge of the Vedas [S&#257;ma, Yajur, &#7770;g and Atharva], and also the supplementary Vedic knowledge [&#256;yur-veda, Dhanur-veda, etc.]. Others were those who had been freed of the reactions to fruitive activities by transcendental knowledge awakened by practice of yoga. And still others were those who had attained residence in Brahmaloka not by ordinary karma but by advanced Vedic knowledge. After devotedly worshiping the upraised lotus feet of the Supreme Lord with oblations of water, Lord Brahm&#257;, who was born of the lotus emanating from Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&rsquo;s navel, offered prayers to the Lord.</div>

But in the Fifth Canto it is stated that the Ganges began when V&#257;manadeva&rsquo;s left foot pierced the covering of the universe so that the transcendental water of the Causal Ocean leaked through. And elsewhere it is also stated that Lord N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a appeared as the water of the Ganges. The water of the Ganges, therefore, is a combination of three transcendental waters, and thus the Ganges is able to purify the three worlds.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead was pleased by the behavior of Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja.

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was extremely truthful. Being unable to keep his promise, he was very much afraid, for he knew that one who has deviated from truthfulness is insignificant in the eyes of society. An exalted person can suffer the consequences of hellish life, but he is very much afraid of being defamed for deviation from the truth. Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja agreed with great pleasure to accept the punishment awarded him by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s dynasty there were many <span class="Italic">asuras</span> who because of their enmity toward Vi&#7779;&#7751;u had achieved a destination more exalted than that of many mystic <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s.</span> Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja specifically remembered the determination of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja in devotional service. Considering all these points, he decided to give his head in charity as the place for Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&rsquo;s third step. Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja also considered how great personalities give up their family relationships and material possessions to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Indeed, they sometimes even sacrifice their lives for the satisfaction of the Lord, just to become His personal servants. Accordingly, by following in the footsteps of previous <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> and devotees, Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja perceived himself successful.</div>

While Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was present, Lord Brahm&#257; and Bali&rsquo;s wife, Vindhy&#257;vali, described the supremacy of the Supreme Lord. Since Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja had given everything to the Lord, they prayed for his release. The Lord then described how a nondevotee&rsquo;s possession of wealth is a danger whereas a devotee&rsquo;s opulence is a benediction from the Lord.

Because You were working on behalf of Your devotees, You do not regard this as cheating. Never mind. I cannot be considered a devotee. Nonetheless, because although You are the husband of the goddess of fortune You have come to me to beg, I must satisfy You to the best of my ability. So please do not think that I wanted to cheat You; I must fulfill my promise. I still have my body.

By false prestige one is misguided, so the Supreme Lord takes away their position of false prestige as a special favor.</div>

Why should one give up any one of them and take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead? But from the behavior of great personalities like Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja we understand that surrendering to the Lord is the right action for an intelligent person. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja took shelter of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u against the will of his father. Similarly, Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja took shelter of V&#257;manadeva against the will of his spiritual master, &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya, and all the leading demons. People may be surprised that devotees like Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja could seek shelter of the side of the enemy, giving up the natural affinity for family, hearth and home. In this connection, Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja explains that the body, which is the center of all material activities, is also a foreign element. Even though we want to keep the body fit and helpful to our activities, the body cannot continue eternally. Although I am the soul, which is eternal, after using the body for some time I have to accept another body (<span class="Italic">tath&#257; deh&#257;ntara-pr&#257;pti&#7717;</span>), according to the laws of nature, unless I render some service with the body for advancement in devotional service. One should not use the body for any other purpose. One must know that if he uses the body for any other purpose he is simply wasting time, for as soon as the time is ripe, the soul will automatically leave the body.</div>
<div class="Purport">We are very interested in society, friendship and love, but what are they? Those in the garb of friends and relatives merely plunder the hard-earned money of the bewildered soul.

<div class="First">Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja appreciated the actions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although all the members of the demoniac families except Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja considered Vi&#7779;&#7751;u their eternal traditional enemy. As described by Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u was actually not the enemy of the family but the best friend of the family. The principle of this friendship has already been stated. <span class="Italic">Yasy&#257;ham anug&#7771;hn&#257;mi hari&#7779;ye tad-dhana&#7745; &#347;anai&#7717;:</span> the Lord bestows special favor upon His devotee by taking away all his material opulences. Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja appreciated this behavior by the Lord. Therefore he said, <span class="Italic">daivena n&#299;ta&#7717; prasabha&#7745; ty&#257;jita-&#347;r&#299;&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;It is to bring me to the right platform of eternal life that You have put me into these circumstances.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">Actually, everyone should fear the so-called society, friendship and love for which he works so hard all day and night.

Such a person is described as <span class="Italic">pramatta,</span> a madman chasing the will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp. Such men do not know that after a hard struggle for life one must change his body, with no certainty of what kind of body he will receive next. Those who are completely established in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious philosophy and who therefore understand the aim of life will never take to the activities of the materialistic dog race. But if a sincere devotee somehow does fall down, the Lord corrects him and saves him from gliding down to the darkest region of hellish life.</div>

<div class="Translation">&#346;r&#299;mat&#299; Vindhy&#257;vali said: O my Lord, You have created the entire universe for the enjoyment of Your personal pastimes, but foolish, unintelligent men have claimed proprietorship for material enjoyment. Certainly they are shameless agnostics. Falsely claiming proprietorship, they think they can give charity and enjoy. In such a condition, what good can they do for You, who are the independent creator, maintainer and annihilator of this universe?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s wife, who was most intelligent, supported the arrest of her husband and accused him of having no intelligence because he had claimed proprietorship of the property of the Lord. Such a claim is a sign of demoniac life. Although the demigods, who are officials appointed by the Lord for management, are attached to materialistic enjoyment, they never claim to be proprietors of the universe, for they know that the actual proprietor of everything is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the qualification of the demigods. But the demons, instead of accepting the exclusive proprietorship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, claim the property of the universe for themselves through demarcations of nationalism. &ldquo;This part is mine, and that part is yours,&rdquo; they say. &ldquo;This part I can give in charity, and this part I can keep for my enjoyment.&rdquo; These are all demoniac conceptions. This is described in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexae80.html?g=5107">16.13</a>): <span class="Italic">idam adya may&#257; labdham ima&#7745; pr&#257;psye manoratham.</span> &ldquo;Thus far I have acquired so much money and land. Now I have to add more and more. In this way I shall be the greatest proprietor of everything. Who can compete with me?&rdquo; These are all demoniac conceptions.</div>
<div class="Purport">Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s wife accused Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja by saying that although the Supreme Personality of Godhead had arrested him, showing him extraordinary mercy, and although Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was offering his body to the Supreme Lord for the Lord&rsquo;s third step, he was still in the darkness of ignorance. Actually the body did not belong to him, but because of his long-standing demoniac mentality he could not understand this. He thought that since he had been defamed for his inability to fulfill his promise of charity, and since the body belonged to him, he would free himself from defamation by offering his body. Actually, however, the body does not belong to anyone but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by whom the body is given. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index0d72.html?g=5952">18.61</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">&#299;&#347;vara&#7717; sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;n&#257;&#7745;<br>h&#7771;d-de&#347;e &rsquo;rjuna ti&#7779;&#7789;hati<br>bhr&#257;mayan sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;ni<br>yantr&#257;r&#363;&#7693;h&#257;ni m&#257;yay&#257;</div>

<div class="After-Verse">The Lord is situated in the core of everyone&rsquo;s heart, and, according to the material desires of the living entity, the Lord offers a particular type of machine&mdash;the body&mdash;through the agency of the material energy. The body actually does not belong to the living entity; it belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Under the circumstances, how could Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja claim that the body belonged to him?</div>
<div class="Purport">Thus Vindhy&#257;vali, Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s intelligent wife, prayed that her husband be released, by the Lord&rsquo;s causeless mercy. Otherwise, Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was nothing but a shameless demon, specifically described as <span class="Italic">tyakta-hriyas tvad-avaropita-kart&#7771;-v&#257;d&#257;&#7717;,</span> a foolish person claiming proprietorship over the property of the Supreme Person. In the present age, Kali-yuga, the number of such shameless men, who are agnostics disbelieving in the existence of God, has increased. Trying to defy the authority of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, so-called scientists, philosophers and politicians manufacture plans and schemes for the destruction of the world. They cannot do anything good for the world, and unfortunately, because of Kali-yuga, they have plunged the affairs of the world into mismanagement. Thus there is a great need for the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement for the benefit of innocent people who are being carried away by propaganda of such demons. If the present status quo is allowed to continue, people will certainly suffer more and more under the leadership of these demoniac agnostics.</div>

<div class="First">The Supreme Personality of Godhead is fully independent. Thus it is not always a fact that a living being&rsquo;s loss of all opulence is a sign of the Supreme Lord&rsquo;s mercy upon him. The Lord can act any way He likes. He may take away one&rsquo;s opulence, or He may not. There are varieties of forms of life, and the Lord treats them according to the circumstances, as He chooses.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Devotees like Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, who was given unlimited material opulence, have the special mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Once Kuvera wanted to give Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja a benediction, but although Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja could have asked him for any amount of material opulence, he instead begged Kuvera that he might continue his devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When a devotee is fixed in his devotional service, there is no need for the Lord to deprive him of his material opulences. The Supreme Personality of Godhead never takes away material opulences achieved because of devotional service, although He sometimes takes away opulences achieved by pious activities. He does this to make a devotee prideless or put him in a better position in devotional service. If a special devotee is meant for preaching but does not give up his family life or material opulences to take to the service of the Lord, the Lord surely takes away his material opulences and establishes him in devotional service.

<div class="First">In this verse, the words <span class="Italic">s&#299;dann api na muhyati</span> are very important. A devotee is sometimes put into adversity while executing devotional service. In adversity, everyone laments and becomes aggrieved, but by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a devotee, even in the worst condition, can understand that he is going through a severe examination by the Personality of Godhead. Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja passed all such examinations, as explained in the following verses.</div>

That Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja endured all these severe tests and austerities is the mercy of the Supreme Lord. The Lord certainly appreciates the devotee&rsquo;s forbearance, and it is recorded for the future glorification of the devotee. This was not an ordinary test. As described in this verse, hardly anyone could survive such a test, but for the future glorification of Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, one of the <span class="Italic">mah&#257;janas,</span> the Supreme Personality of Godhead not only tested him but also gave him the strength to tolerate such adversity. The Lord is so kind to His devotee that when severely testing him the Lord gives him the necessary strength to be tolerant and continue to remain a glorious devotee.</div>

<div class="First">This is the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even if the Lord takes away a devotee&rsquo;s material opulences, the Lord immediately offers him a position of which the demigods cannot even dream. There are many examples of this in the history of devotional service. One of them is the opulence of Sud&#257;m&#257; Vipra. Sud&#257;m&#257; Vipra suffered severe material scarcity, but he was not disturbed and did not deviate from devotional service. Thus he was ultimately given an exalted position by the mercy of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Here the word <span class="Italic">mad-&#257;&#347;raya&#7717;</span> is very significant. Because the Lord wanted to give Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja the exalted position of Indra, the demigods might naturally have been envious of him and might have fought to disturb his position. But the Supreme Personality of Godhead assured Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja that he would always remain under the Lord&rsquo;s protection (<span class="Italic">mad-&#257;&#347;raya&#7717;</span>).</div>

<div class="First">Vi&#347;vakarm&#257; is the engineer or architect for the palatial buildings in the heavenly planets. Therefore, since he was engaged to construct the residential quarters of Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, the buildings and palaces on the planet Sutala must at least equal those on the heavenly planets. A further advantage of this place designed for Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was that he would not be disturbed by any outward calamity. Moreover, he would not be disturbed by mental or bodily miseries. These are all extraordinary features of the planet Sutala, where Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja would live.</div>
<div class="Purport">In the Vedic literatures we find descriptions of many different planets where there are many, many palaces, hundreds and thousands of times better than those of which we have experience on this planet earth. When we speak of palaces, this naturally includes the idea of great cities and towns. Unfortunately, when modern scientists try to explore other planets they see nothing but rocks and sand. Of course, they may go on their frivolous excursions, but the students of the Vedic literature will never believe them or give them any credit for exploring other planets.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The great soul Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja experienced that the highest gain in life is to attain devotional service under the shelter of the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet in full surrender. Being fixed in this conclusion, his heart full of ecstatic devotion and his eyes full of tears, he offered obeisances to the Personality of Godhead and then, with his associates, entered the planet known as Sutala. Thus the Supreme Personality of Godhead satisfied the desire of Aditi and reinstalled Lord Indra. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, being aware of Bali&rsquo;s release from arrest, then described the transcendental pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in this material world. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja praised the Supreme Lord for creating the material world, for being equal to everyone and for being extremely liberal to the devotees, just like a desire tree. Indeed, Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja said that the Lord is kind not only to His devotees but also to the demons. In this way he described the unlimited causeless mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then, with folded hands, he offered his respectful obeisances unto the Lord, and after circumambulating the Lord he also entered the planet Sutala in accordance with the Lord&rsquo;s order. The Lord then ordered &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya to describe Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s faults and discrepancies in executing the sacrificial ceremony. &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya became free from fruitive actions by chanting the holy name of the Lord, and he explained how chanting can diminish all the faults of the conditioned soul. He then completed Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s sacrificial ceremony. All the great saintly persons accepted Lord V&#257;manadeva as the benefactor of Lord Indra because He had returned Indra to his heavenly planet. They accepted the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the maintainer of all the affairs of the universe. Being very happy, Indra, along with his associates, placed V&#257;manadeva before him and reentered the heavenly planet in their airplane. Having seen the wonderful activities of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u in the sacrificial arena of Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, all the demigods, saintly persons, Pit&#257;s, Bh&#363;tas and Siddhas glorified the Lord again and again. The chapter concludes by saying that the most auspicious function of the conditioned soul is to chant and hear about the glorious activities of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him.&rdquo; The Supreme Personality of Godhead is certainly equal toward all living entities, but a devotee who fully surrenders at the lotus feet of the Lord is different from a nondevotee. In other words, everyone can take shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord to enjoy equal benedictions from the Lord, but nondevotees do not do so, and therefore they suffer the consequences created by the material energy. We can understand this fact by a simple example. The king or government is equal to all citizens. Therefore, if a citizen capable of receiving special favors from the government is offered such favors, this does not mean that the government is partial. One who knows how to receive favors from the authority can receive them, but one who does not neglects these favors and does not receive them. There are two classes of men&mdash;the demons and the demigods. The demigods are fully aware of the Supreme Lord&rsquo;s position, and therefore they are obedient to Him, but even if demons know about the supremacy of the Lord they purposely defy His authority. Therefore, the Lord makes distinctions according to the mentality of the living being, but otherwise He is equal to everyone. Like a desire tree, the Lord fulfills the desires of one who takes shelter of Him, but one who does not take such shelter is distinct from the surrendered soul. One who takes shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord is favored by the Lord, regardless of whether such a person is a demon or a demigod.</div>

The <span class="Italic">kani&#7779;&#7789;ha-adhik&#257;r&#299;,</span> or neophyte devotee, is therefore advised to visit the temple every day and see the form of the Lord regularly. Thus the neophyte devotee can be freed from the bondage of fruitive activities.</div>

<div class="First">When Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja had departed for the planet Sutala, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u asked &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya what the fault was in Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja for which &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya had cursed him. It might be argued that since Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja had now left the scene, how could his faults be judged? In reply to this, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u informed &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya that there was no need for Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s presence, for his faults and discrepancies could be nullified if judged before the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> As will be seen in the next verse, Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja had no faults; &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya had unnecessarily cursed him. Nonetheless, this was better for Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. Being cursed by &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya, Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was deprived of all his possessions, with the result that the Supreme Personality of Godhead favored him for his strong faith in devotional service. Of course, a devotee is not required to engage in fruitive activities. As stated in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra, sarv&#257;rha&#7751;am acyutejy&#257;</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="index588e.html?g=41862">4.31.14</a>).

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting the holy name of the Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way.&rdquo; (<span class="Ref_Italic">B&#7771;han-n&#257;rad&#299;ya Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> 38.126) In this age of Kali, it is extremely difficult to perform Vedic ritualistic ceremonies or sacrifices perfectly. Hardly anyone can chant the Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras</span> with perfect pronunciation or accumulate the paraphernalia for Vedic performances. Therefore the sacrifice recommended in this age is <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana,</span> constant chanting of the holy name of the Lord. <span class="Italic">Yaj&ntilde;ai&#7717; sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana-pr&#257;yair yajanti hi sumedhasa&#7717;</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> 11.5.29). Instead of wasting time performing Vedic sacrifices, those who are intelligent, those who possess good brain substance, should take to the chanting of the Lord&rsquo;s holy name and thus perform sacrifice perfectly. I have seen that many religious leaders are addicted to performing <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;as</span> and spending hundreds and thousands of rupees for imperfect sacrificial performances. This is a lesson for those who unnecessarily execute such imperfect sacrifices. We should take the advice of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu (<span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;ai&#7717; sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana-pr&#257;yair yajanti hi sumedhasa&#7717;</span>). Although &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya was a strict <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> addicted to ritualistic activities, he also admitted, <span class="Italic">ni&#347;chidram anusa&#7749;k&#299;rtana&#7745; tava:</span> &ldquo;My Lord, constant chanting of the holy name of Your Lordship makes everything perfect.&rdquo; In Kali-yuga the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies cannot be performed as perfectly as before. Therefore &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; has recommended that although one should take care to follow all the principles in every kind of spiritual activity, especially in worship of the Deity, there is still a chance of discrepancies, and one should compensate for this by chanting the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement we therefore give special stress to the chanting of the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra</span> in all activities.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The Supreme Personality of Godhead expands Himself by <span class="Italic">sv&#257;&#7745;&#347;a</span> (His personal expansions) and <span class="Italic">vibhinn&#257;&#7745;&#347;a</span> (His expansions as the living entities).

He especially descends to give protection to the cows, the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> the demigods, the devotees and the Vedic system of religion. Thus He appears in various forms&mdash;sometimes as a fish, sometimes a boar, sometimes N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva, sometimes V&#257;manadeva and so on&mdash;but in any form or incarnation, although He comes within the atmosphere of the material modes of nature, He is unaffected. This is a sign of His supreme controlling power. Although He comes within the material atmosphere, <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> cannot touch Him. Therefore, no material qualities can be attributed to Him in any degree.</div>
</div><A NAME="108099"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Once, at the end of the previous <span class="Italic">kalpa,</span> a demon named Hayagr&#299;va wanted to take the Vedic knowledge away from Lord Brahm&#257; at the time of annihilation. Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead took the incarnation of a fish at the beginning of the period of Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu and saved the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> During the reign of C&#257;k&#7779;u&#7779;a Manu there was a king named Satyavrata, who was a great pious ruler. To save him, the Lord appeared as the fish incarnation for a second time. King Satyavrata later became the son of the sun-god and was known as &#346;r&#257;ddhadeva. He was established as Manu by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
</div><A NAME="108100"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">To receive the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, King Satyavrata engaged in the austerity of subsisting only by drinking water. Once, while performing this austerity on the bank of the K&#7771;tam&#257;l&#257; River and offering oblations of water with the palm of his hand, he found a small fish. The fish appealed to the King for protection, asking the King to keep Him in a safe place. Although the King did not know that the small fish was the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, as a king he gave shelter to the fish and kept Him in a water jug. The fish, being the Supreme Personality of Godhead, wanted to show His potency to King Satyavrata, and thus He immediately expanded His body in such a way that He could no longer be kept in the jug of water. The King then put the fish in a big well, but the well was also too small. Then the King put the fish in a lake, but the lake was also unsuitable. Finally the King put the fish in the sea, but even the sea could not accommodate Him. Thus the King understood that the fish was no one else but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he requested the Lord to describe His incarnation as a fish. The Personality of Godhead, being pleased with the King, informed him that within a week there would be an inundation throughout the universe and that the fish incarnation would protect the King, along with the <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is,</span> herbs, seeds and other living entities, in a boat, which would be attached to the fish&rsquo;s horn. After saying this, the Lord disappeared. King Satyavrata offered respectful obeisances to the Supreme Lord and continued to meditate upon Him. In due course of time, annihilation took place, and the King saw a boat coming near. After getting aboard with learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and saintly persons, he offered prayers to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone&rsquo;s heart, and thus he taught Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Satyavrata and the saintly persons about Vedic knowledge from the core of the heart. King Satyavrata took his next birth as Vaivasvata Manu, who is mentioned in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> <span class="Italic">Vivasv&#257;n manave pr&#257;ha:</span> the sun-god spoke the science of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> to his son Manu. Because of being the son of Vivasv&#257;n, this Manu is known as Vaivasvata Manu.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">O my Lord, possessing eyes like the petals of a lotus, the worship of the demigods, who are in the bodily concept of life, is fruitless in all respects. But because You are the supreme friend and dearmost Supersoul of everyone, worship of Your lotus feet is never useless. You have therefore manifested Your form as a fish.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The demigods like Indra, Candra and S&#363;rya are ordinary living entities who are differentiated parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord expands Himself through the living beings (<span class="Italic">nityo nity&#257;n&#257;&#7745; cetana&#347; cetan&#257;n&#257;m</span>). His personal <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-tattva</span> forms, which are all spiritual, are called <span class="Italic">sv&#257;&#7745;&#347;a,</span> and the living entities who are differentiated parts are called <span class="Italic">vibhinn&#257;&#7745;&#347;a.</span> Some of the <span class="Italic">vibhinn&#257;&#7745;&#347;a</span> forms are spiritual, and some are a combination of matter and spirit. The conditioned souls in the material world are different from their external bodies made of material energy. Thus the demigods living in the upper planetary systems and the living entities living in the lower planetary system are of the same nature. Nonetheless, those living as human beings on this planet are sometimes attracted to worshiping the demigods in the higher planetary systems. Such worship is temporary. As the human beings on this planet have to change their bodies (<span class="Italic">tath&#257; deh&#257;ntara-pr&#257;pti&#7717;</span>), the living entities known as Indra, Candra, Varu&#7751;a and so on will also have to change their bodies in due course of time. As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> <span class="Italic">antavat tu phala&#7745; te&#7779;&#257;&#7745; tad bhavaty alpa-medhas&#257;m:</span> &ldquo;Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary.&rdquo; <span class="Italic">K&#257;mais tais tair h&#7771;ta j&ntilde;&#257;n&#257;&#7717; prapadyante &rsquo;nya-devat&#257;&#7717;: </I>[Bg. </I></span><a href="indexda67.html?g=2640">7.20</a>] those who do not know the position of the demigods are inclined to worship the demigods for some material purpose, but the results of such worship are never permanent. Consequently, here it is said, <span class="Italic">yathetare&#7779;&#257;&#7745; p&#7771;thag-&#257;tman&#257;&#7745; sat&#257;m, padopasarpa&#7751;a&#7745; m&#7771;&#7779;&#257; bhavet.</span> In other words, if one is to worship someone else, he must worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then his worship will never be fruitless. <span class="Italic">Svalpam apy asya dharmasya tr&#257;yate mahato bhay&#257;t:</span> even a slight attempt to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead is a permanent asset. Therefore, as recommended in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, tyaktv&#257; sva-dharma&#7745; cara&#7751;&#257;mbuja&#7745; hare&#7717;.</span> One should take to the worship of the lotus feet of Hari, even if this means giving up the so-called occupational duty assigned because of the particular body one has accepted. Because worship in terms of the body is temporary, it does not bear any permanent fruit. But worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead gives immense benefit.</div>

<div class="Translation">Pulling the boat, with you and all the &#7771;&#7779;is in it, O King, I shall travel in the water of devastation until the night of Lord Brahm&#257;&rsquo;s slumber is over.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This particular devastation actually took place not during the night of Lord Brahm&#257; but during his day, for it was during the time of C&#257;k&#7779;u&#7779;a Manu. Brahm&#257;&rsquo;s night takes place when Brahm&#257; goes to sleep, but in the daytime there are fourteen Manus, one of whom is C&#257;k&#7779;u&#7779;a Manu. Therefore, &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura comments that although it was daytime for Lord Brahm&#257;, Brahm&#257; felt sleepy for a short time by the supreme will of the Lord. This short period is regarded as Lord Brahm&#257;&rsquo;s night. This has been elaborately discussed by &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; in his <span class="Italic">Laghu-bh&#257;gavat&#257;m&#7771;ta.</span> The following is a summary of his analysis. Because Agastya Muni cursed Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu, during the time of Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu a devastation took place. This devastation is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Matsya Pur&#257;&#7751;a.</span> During the time of C&#257;k&#7779;u&#7779;a Manu, by the supreme will of the Lord, there was suddenly another <span class="Italic">pralaya,</span> or devastation. This is mentioned by M&#257;rka&#7751;&#7693;eya &#7770;&#7779;i in the <span class="Italic">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u-dharmottara.</span> At the end of Manu&rsquo;s time there is not necessarily a devastation, but at the end of the C&#257;k&#7779;u&#7779;a-<span class="Italic">manvantara,</span> the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by His illusory energy, wanted to show Satyavrata the effects of devastation. &#346;r&#299;la &#346;r&#299;dhara Sv&#257;m&#299; also agrees with this opinion.

That which is revealed to one who fully surrenders is different from what is revealed to one who surrenders partially. Everyone naturally surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, either directly or indirectly. The conditioned soul surrenders to the laws of nature in material existence, but when one fully surrenders to the Lord, material nature does not act upon him. Such a fully surrendered soul is favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly. <span class="Italic">M&#257;m eva ye prapadyante m&#257;y&#257;m et&#257;&#7745; taranti te</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexd990.html?g=2586">7.14</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> One who has fully surrendered to the Lord has no fear of the modes of material nature, for everything is but an expansion of the Lord&rsquo;s glories (<span class="Italic">sarva&#7745; khalv ida&#7745; brahma</span>), and these glories are gradually revealed and realized.

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">One who wants to be free of material entanglement should take to the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and give up the contamination of ignorance, involving pious and impious activities. Thus one regains his original identity, just as a block of gold or silver sheds all dirt and becomes purified when treated with fire. May that inexhaustible Supreme Personality of Godhead become our spiritual master, for He is the original spiritual master of all other spiritual masters.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In human life one is meant to undergo austerity to purify one&rsquo;s existence. <span class="Italic">Tapo divya&#7745; putrak&#257; yena sattva&#7745; &#347;uddhyet.</span> Because of contamination by the modes of material nature, one continues in the cycle of birth and death (<span class="Italic">k&#257;ra&#7751;a&#7745; gu&#7751;a-sa&#7749;go &rsquo;sya sad-asad-yoni janmasu</span>). Therefore the purpose of human life is to purify oneself of this contamination so that one can regain his spiritual form and not undergo this cycle of birth and death. The recommended process of decontamination is devotional service to the Lord. There are various processes for self-realization, such as <span class="Italic">karma, j&ntilde;&#257;na</span> and <span class="Italic">yoga,</span> but none of them is equal to the process of devotional service. As gold and silver can be freed from all dirty contamination by being put into a fire but not merely by being washed, the living entity can be awakened to his own identity by performing devotional service (<span class="Italic">yat-sevay&#257;</span>), but not by <span class="Italic">karma, j&ntilde;&#257;na</span> or <span class="Italic">yoga.</span> Cultivation of speculative knowledge or practice of yogic gymnastics will not be helpful.</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">var&#7751;am</span> refers to the luster of one&rsquo;s original identity. The original luster of gold or silver is brilliant. Similarly, the original luster of the living being, who is part of the <span class="Italic">sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha</span><I> <span class="Italic"></I>[</I>Bs. </span>5.1</I>]<span class="Italic"></I>,</span> is the luster of <span class="Italic">&#257;nanda,</span> or pleasure. <span class="Italic">&#256;nandamayo bhy&#257;s&#257;t.</span> Every living entity has the right to become <span class="Italic">&#257;nandamaya,</span> joyful, because he is part of the <span class="Italic">sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha</span><I> <span class="Italic"></I>[</I>Bs. </span>5.1</I>]<span class="Italic"></I>,</span> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Why should the living being be put into tribulation because of dirty contamination by the material modes of nature? The living entity should become purified and regain his <span class="Italic">svar&#363;pa,</span> his original identity. This he can do only by devotional service. Therefore, one should adopt the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is described here as <span class="Italic">guror guru&#7717;,</span> the spiritual master of all other spiritual masters.</div>
<div class="Purport">Even though we may not have the fortune to contact the Supreme Lord personally, the Lord&rsquo;s representative is as good as the Lord Himself because such a representative does not say anything unless it is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu therefore gives a definition of <span class="Italic">guru.</span> <span class="Italic">Y&#257;re dekha, t&#257;re kaha &lsquo;k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;-upade&#347;a:</I> [</span></I>Cc. <span class="Ref_Italic"></B></I>Madhya</span></B></I> <a href="index89c7.html?g=104673">7.128</a>] the bona fide <span class="Italic">guru</span> is he who advises his disciples exactly in accordance with the principles spoken by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The bona fide <span class="Italic">guru</span> is he who has accepted K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as <span class="Italic">guru.</span> This is the <span class="Italic">guru-parampar&#257;</span> system. The original <span class="Italic">guru</span> is Vy&#257;sadeva because he is the speaker of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> wherein everything spoken relates to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Therefore <span class="Italic">guru-p&#363;j&#257;</span> is known as Vy&#257;sa-p&#363;j&#257;. In the final analysis, the original <span class="Italic">guru</span> is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, His disciple is N&#257;rada, whose disciple is Vy&#257;sa, and in this way we gradually come in touch with the <span class="Italic">guru-parampar&#257;.</span> One cannot become a <span class="Italic">guru</span> if he does not know what the Personality of Godhead K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a or His incarnation wants. The mission of the <span class="Italic">guru</span> is the mission of the Supreme Personality of Godhead: to spread K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness all over the world.</div>

<div class="First">So-called <span class="Italic">gurus</span> instruct their disciples for the sake of material profit.

But although You are within the heart, the foolish, because of lusty desires in the heart, cannot understand You.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Herein the reason for foolishness is described. Because the conditioned soul in this material world is full of materialistic lusty desires, he cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although the Lord is situated in everyone&rsquo;s heart (<span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;vara&#7717; sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;n&#257;&#7745; h&#7771;d-de&#347;e&rsquo;rjuna ti&#7779;&#7789;hati</I> [Bg. </I><a href="index0d72.html?g=5952">18.61</a></I>]</I></span>). It is because of this foolishness that one cannot take instructions from the Lord, although the Lord is ready to instruct everyone both externally and internally. The Lord says, <span class="Italic">dad&#257;mi buddhi-yoga&#7745; tam yena m&#257;m upay&#257;nti te.</span> In other words, the Lord can give instructions on devotional service by which one can return home, back to Godhead. Unfortunately, however, people do not take this devotional service. The Lord, being situated in everyone&rsquo;s heart, can give one complete instructions on going back to Godhead, but because of lusty desires one engages himself in materialistic activities and does not render service to the Lord. Therefore one is bereft of the value of the Lord&rsquo;s instructions. By mental speculation one can understand that one is not the body but a spirit soul, but unless one engages in devotional service, the real purpose of life is never fulfilled. The real purpose of life is to go back home, back to Godhead, and live with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, play with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, dance with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and eat with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. These are different items of <span class="Italic">&#257;nanda,</span> spiritual happiness in spiritual variegatedness. Even though one may come to the platform of <span class="Italic">brahma-bh&#363;ta</span> and understand his spiritual identity by speculative knowledge, one cannot enjoy spiritual life without understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is indicated here by the word <span class="Italic">abh&#299;&#7779;&#7789;a-siddhi&#7717;.</span> One can fulfill the ultimate goal of life only by engaging in devotional service to the Lord. Then the Lord will give one proper instructions on how to go back home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Sometimes it is argued that people do not know who is a spiritual master and that finding a spiritual master from whom to get enlightenment in regard to the destination of life is very difficult. To answer all these questions, King Satyavrata shows us the way to accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the real spiritual master. The Supreme Lord has given full directions in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> about how to deal with everything in this material world and how to return home, back to Godhead. Therefore, one should not be misled by so-called <span class="Italic">gurus</span> who are rascals and fools. Rather, one should directly see the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the <span class="Italic">guru</span> or instructor. It is difficult, however, to understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> without the help of the <span class="Italic">guru.</span> Therefore the <span class="Italic">guru</span> appears in the <span class="Italic">parampar&#257;</span> system. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexc9da.html?g=1729">4.34</a>) the Supreme Personality of Godhead recommends:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">tad viddhi pra&#7751;ip&#257;tena<br>paripra&#347;nena sevay&#257;<br>upadek&#7779;yanti te j&ntilde;&#257;na&#7745;<br>j&ntilde;&#257;ninas tattva-dar&#347;ina&#7717;</div>
</div><A NAME="108784"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.&rdquo; Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a directly instructed Arjuna. Arjuna is therefore <span class="Italic">tattva-dar&#347;&#299;</span> or <span class="Italic">guru.</span> Arjuna accepted the Supreme Personality of Godhead (<span class="Italic">para&#7745; brahma para&#7745; dh&#257;ma pavitra&#7745; parama&#7745; bhav&#257;n</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="index1ba6.html?g=3396">10.12</a></I>]</I>). Similarly, following in the footsteps of &#346;r&#299; Arjuna, who is a personal devotee of the Lord, one should accept the supremacy of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, as supported by Vy&#257;sa, Devala, Asita, N&#257;rada and later by the <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> R&#257;m&#257;nuj&#257;c&#257;rya, Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya, Nimb&#257;rka and Vi&#7779;&#7751;usv&#257;m&#299; and still later by the greatest <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya,</span> &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. Where, then, is the difficulty in finding a <span class="Italic">guru</span>? If one is sincere he can find the <span class="Italic">guru</span> and learn everything. One should take lessons from the <span class="Italic">guru</span> and find out the goal of life. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Satyavrata, therefore, shows us the way of the <span class="Italic">mah&#257;jana.</span> <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;jano yena gata&#7717; sa panth&#257;&#7717;.</span> One should surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead (<span class="Italic">da&#347;&#257;vat&#257;ra</span>) and learn from Him about the spiritual world and the goal of life.</div>

<div class="Translation">I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who pretended to be a gigantic fish, who restored the Vedic literature to Lord Brahm&#257; when Lord Brahm&#257; awakened from sleep, and who explained the essence of Vedic literature to King Satyavrata and the great saintly persons.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Here is a summary of Satyavrata&rsquo;s meeting with the fish incarnation of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&rsquo;s purpose was to take back all the Vedic literatures from the demon Hayagr&#299;va and restore them to Lord Brahm&#257;. Incidentally, by His causeless mercy, the Lord spoke with Satyavrata. The word <span class="Italic">satyavrat&#257;n&#257;m</span> is significant because it indicates that those on the level of Satyavrata can take knowledge from the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> delivered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Whatever is spoken by the Supreme Lord is accepted as <span class="Italic">Veda.</span> As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> <span class="Italic">ved&#257;nta-k&#7771;d veda-vit:</span> the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the compiler of all Vedic knowledge, and He knows the purport of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> Therefore, anyone who takes knowledge from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, or from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as it is, knows the purpose of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> (<span class="Italic">vedai&#347; ca sarvair aham eva vedya&#7717;</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a>]). One cannot understand Vedic knowledge from the <span class="Italic">veda-v&#257;da-rat&#257;s,</span> who read the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and misconstrue their subject matter. One has to know the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Thus-end">Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Twenty-fourth Chapter, of the <span class="non-Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> entitled &ldquo;Matsya, the Lord&rsquo;s Fish Incarnation.&rdquo;</div>
