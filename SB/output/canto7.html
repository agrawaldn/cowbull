<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">In this chapter, in response to a question by Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; gives his conclusions concerning how the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although the Supersoul, friend and protector of everyone, killed the Daityas, the demons, for the sake of Indra, the King of heaven. In his statements, he totally refutes the arguments of people in general who accuse the Supreme Lord of partiality. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; proves that because the body of the conditioned soul is infected by the three qualities of nature, dualities arise such as enmity and friendship, attachment and detachment. For the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, there are no such dualities. Even eternal time cannot control the activities of the Lord. Eternal time is created by the Lord, and it acts under His control. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, therefore, is always transcendental to the influence of the modes of nature, <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> the Lord&rsquo;s external energy, which acts in creation and annihilation. Thus all the demons killed by the Supreme Lord attain salvation immediately.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The second question raised by Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja concerns how &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la, although inimical toward K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a from his very childhood and always blaspheming K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, attained salvation in oneness when K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a killed him. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; explains that because of their offenses at the feet of devotees, two attendants of the Lord in Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha named Jaya and Vijaya became Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu and Hira&#7751;y&#257;k&#7779;a in Satya-yuga, R&#257;va&#7751;a and Kumbhakar&#7751;a in the next <span class="Italic">yuga,</span> Tret&#257;-yuga, and &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la and Dantavakra at the end of Dv&#257;para-yuga. Because of their fruitive acts, Jaya and Vijaya agreed to become the Lord&rsquo;s enemies, and when killed in that mentality, they attained salvation in oneness. Thus even if one thinks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in envy, he attains salvation. What then is to be said of devotees who always engage in the Lord&rsquo;s service with love and faith?</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">King Par&#299;k&#7779;it inquired: My dear br&#257;hma&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, being everyone&rsquo;s well-wisher, is equal and extremely dear to everyone. How, then, did He become partial like a common man for the sake of Indra and thus kill Indra&rsquo;s enemies? How can a person equal to everyone be partial to some and inimical toward others?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index90b5.html?g=3246">9.29</a>) the Lord says, <span class="Italic">samo &rsquo;ha&#7745; sarva-bh&#363;te&#7779;u na me dve&#7779;yo &rsquo;sti na priya&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;I am equal to everyone. No one is dear to Me, nor is anyone My enemy.&rdquo; In the previous canto, however, it has been observed that the Lord sided with Indra by killing the demons on his account (<span class="Italic">hata-putr&#257; diti&#7717; &#347;akra-p&#257;r&#7779;&#7751;i-gr&#257;he&#7751;a vi&#7779;&#7751;un&#257;</span>). Therefore, the Lord was clearly partial to Indra, although He is the Supersoul in everyone&rsquo;s heart. The soul is extremely dear to everyone, and similarly the Supersoul is also dear to everyone. Thus there cannot be any faulty action on the part of the Supersoul. The Lord is always kind to all living entities, irrespective of form and situation, yet He took the side of Indra just like an ordinary friend. This was the subject of Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s inquiry. As a devotee of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, he knew very well that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a cannot be partial to anyone, but when he saw that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a acted as the enemy of the demons, he was somewhat doubtful. Therefore he posed this question to &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; for a clear answer.</div>
<div class="Purport">A devotee cannot accept that Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u has material qualifications. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it knew perfectly well that Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, being transcendental, has nothing to do with material qualities, but to confirm his conviction he wanted to hear from the authority &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura says, <span class="Italic">samasya katha&#7745; vai&#7779;amyam:</span> since the Lord is equally disposed toward everyone, how can He be partial? <span class="Italic">Priyasya katham asure&#7779;u pr&#299;ty-abh&#257;va&#7717;.</span> The Lord, being the Supersoul, is extremely dear to everyone. Why, then, should the Lord display unsympathetic behavior toward the <span class="Italic">asuras</span>? How is this impartial? <span class="Italic">Suh&#7771;da&#347; ca katha&#7745; te&#7779;v asauh&#257;rdam.</span> Since the Lord says that He is <span class="Italic">suh&#7771;da&#7745; sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;n&#257;m,</span> the well-wisher of all living entities, how could He act with partiality by killing demons? These questions arose in the heart of Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, and therefore he inquired from &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;.</div>

<div class="Translation">Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u Himself, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the reservoir of all pleasure. Therefore, what benefit would He derive from siding with the demigods? What interest would He fulfill in this way? Since the Lord is transcendental, why should He fear the asuras, and how could He be envious of them?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">We should always remember the distinction between spiritual and material. That which is material is infected by material qualities, but these qualities cannot touch that which is spiritual, or transcendental. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is absolute, whether He is in the material world or spiritual world. When we see partiality in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, this vision is due to His external energy. Otherwise how could His enemies attain salvation after being killed by Him? Everyone who deals with the Supreme Personality of Godhead gradually acquires the qualities of the Lord. The more one advances in spiritual consciousness, the less he is affected by the duality of material qualities. The Supreme Lord, therefore, must certainly be freed from these qualities. His enmity and friendship are external features presented by the material energy. He is always transcendental. He is absolute, whether He kills or bestows His favor.</div>
<div class="Purport">Envy and friendship arise in one who is imperfect. We fear our enemies because in the material world we are always in need of help. The Lord, however, does not need anyone&rsquo;s help, for He is <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;r&#257;ma.</span> The Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index8855.html?g=3219">9.26</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">patra&#7745; pu&#7779;pa&#7745; phala&#7745; toya&#7745;<br>yo me bhakty&#257; prayacchati<br>tad aha&#7745; bhakty-upah&#7771;tam<br>a&#347;n&#257;mi prayat&#257;tmana&#7717;</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;If a devotee offers Me with devotion a little leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I shall accept it.&rdquo; Why does the Lord say this? Is He dependent on the offering of the devotee? He is not actually dependent, but He likes to be dependent upon His devotee. This is His mercy. Similarly, He does not fear the <span class="Italic">asuras.</span> Thus there is no question of partiality in the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation">The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, is always transcendental to material qualities, and therefore He is called nirgu&#7751;a, or without qualities.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">So-called attachment, detachment and obligations pertain to the material nature, which is an emanation from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but whenever the Lord descends and acts in this material world, He does so in His spiritual position. Although His activities materially appear different, spiritually they are absolute and nondifferent. Thus it is an imposition upon the Supreme Lord to say that He is envious of anyone or friendly to anyone.</div>
<div class="Purport">In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexa12b.html?g=3084">9.11</a>) the Lord clearly says, <span class="Italic">avaj&#257;nanti m&#257;&#7745; m&#363;&#7693;h&#257; m&#257;nu&#7779;&#299;&#7745; tanum &#257;&#347;ritam:</span> &ldquo;Fools deride Me when I descend in a human form.&rdquo; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appears on this earth or within this universe without any change in His spiritual body or spiritual qualities. Indeed, He is never influenced by the material qualities. He is always free from such qualities, but He appears to act under material influence. This understanding is <span class="Italic">&#257;ropita,</span> or an imposition. Therefore K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says, <span class="Italic">janma karma ca me divyam:</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexe89d.html?g=1505">4.9</a>] whatever He does, being always transcendental, has nothing to do with material qualities. <span class="Italic">Eva&#7745; yo vetti tattvata&#7717;:</span> only devotees can understand the truth of how He acts. The fact is that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is never partial to anyone. He is always equal to everyone, but because of imperfect vision, influenced by material qualities, one imposes material qualities upon K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and when one does so he becomes a <span class="Italic">mu-dha,</span> a fool. When one can properly understand the truth, one becomes devoted and <span class="Italic">nirgu&#7751;a,</span> free from material qualities. Simply by understanding the activities of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a one can become transcendental, and as soon as one is transcendental he is fit to be transferred to the transcendental world. <span class="Italic">Tyaktv&#257; deha&#7745; punar janma naiti m&#257;m eti so &rsquo;rjuna:</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexe89d.html?g=1505">4.9</a>] one who understands the activities of the Lord in truth is transferred to the spiritual world after he gives up his material body.</div>

<div class="Translation">When the quality of goodness is prominent, the sages and demigods flourish with the help of that quality, with which they are infused and surcharged by the Supreme Lord. Similarly, when the mode of passion is prominent the demons flourish, and when ignorance is prominent the Yak&#7779;as and R&#257;k&#7779;asas flourish. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is present in everyone&rsquo;s heart, fostering the reactions of sattva-gu&#7751;a, rajo-gu&#7751;a and tamo-gu&#7751;a.<span class="Italic"></span></div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not partial to anyone. The conditioned soul is under the influence of the various modes of material nature, and behind material nature is the Supreme Personality of Godhead; but one&rsquo;s victory and loss under the influence of <span class="Italic">sattva-gu&#7751;a, rajo-gu&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">tamo-gu&#7751;a</span> are reactions of these modes, not of the Supreme Lord&rsquo;s partiality. &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;, in the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata-sandarbha,</span> has clearly said:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">sattv&#257;dayo na sant&#299;&#347;e<br>yatra ca pr&#257;k&#7771;t&#257; gu&#7751;&#257;&#7717;<br>sa &#347;uddha&#7717; sarva-&#347;uddhebhya&#7717;<br>pum&#257;n &#257;dhya&#7717; pras&#299;datu</div>

<div class="After-Verse">According to this statement of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata-sandarbha,</span> the Supreme Lord, being always transcendental to the material qualities, is never affected by the influence of these qualities. This same characteristic is also present in the living being, but because he is conditioned by material nature, even the pleasure potency of the Lord is manifested in the conditioned soul as troublesome. In the material world the pleasure enjoyed by the conditioned soul is followed by many painful conditions. For instance, we have seen that in the two great wars, which were conducted by the <span class="Italic">rajo-gu&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">tamo-gu&#7751;a,</span> both parties were actually ruined. The German people declared war against the English to ruin them, but the result was that both parties were ruined. Although the Allies were apparently victorious, at least on paper, actually neither of them were victorious. Therefore it should be concluded that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not partial to anyone. Everyone works under the influence of various modes of material nature, and when the various modes are prominent, the demigods or demons appear victorious under the influence of these modes.</div>
<div class="Purport">Everyone enjoys the fruits of his qualitative activities. This is also confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexf527.html?g=4695">14.11</a>&ndash;13):</div>

<div class="Purport">The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present in everyone&rsquo;s heart, simply gives the results of the increase in the various qualities, but He is impartial. He supervises victory and loss, but He does not take part in them.</div>
<div class="Purport">The various modes of material nature do not work all at once. The interactions of these modes are exactly like seasonal changes.

<div class="Translation">The all-pervading Personality of Godhead exists within the heart of every living being, and an expert thinker can perceive how He is present there to a large or small extent. Just as one can understand the supply of fire in wood, the water in a waterpot, or the sky within a pot, one can understand whether a living entity is a demon or a demigod by understanding that living entity&rsquo;s devotional performances. A thoughtful man can understand how much a person is favored by the Supreme Lord by seeing his actions.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index8205.html?g=3654">10.41</a>) the Lord says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">yad yad vibh&#363;timat sattva&#7745;<br>&#347;r&#299;mad &#363;rjitam eva v&#257;<br>tat tad ev&#257;vagaccha tva&#7745;<br>mama tejo-&rsquo;&#7745;&#347;a-sambhavam</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Know that all beautiful, glorious and mighty creations spring from but a spark of My splendor.&rdquo; We have the practical experience of seeing that one person is able to do very wonderful things whereas another cannot do those same things and cannot even do things that require only a little common sense. Therefore, how much a devotee has been favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be tested by the activities the devotee has performed. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index0c2e.html?g=3378">10.10</a>) the Lord also says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">te&#7779;&#257;&#7745; satata-yukt&#257;n&#257;&#7745;<br>bhajat&#257;&#7745; pr&#299;ti-p&#363;rvakam<br>dad&#257;mi buddhi-yoga&#7745; ta&#7745;<br>yena m&#257;m upay&#257;nti te<br></I><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index0c2e.html?g=3378">10.10</a></I>]</I></div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;To those who are constantly devoted and who worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.&rdquo; This is very practical. A teacher instructs the student if the student is capable of taking more and more instructions. Otherwise, in spite of being instructed by the teacher, the student cannot make strides in his understanding. This has nothing to do with partiality. When K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says <span class="Italic">te&#7779;&#257;&#7745; satata-yukt&#257;n&#257;&#7745; bhajat&#257;&#7745; pr&#299;ti-p&#363;rvakam/ dad&#257;mi buddhi-yoga&#7745; tam </I>[Bg. </I></span><a href="index0c2e.html?g=3378">10.10</a>]<span class="Italic">,</span> this indicates that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is prepared to give <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> to everyone, but one must be capable of receiving it. That is the secret. Thus when a person exhibits wonderful devotional activities, a thoughtful man understands that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a has been more favorable to this devotee.</div>
<div class="Purport">This is not difficult to understand, but envious persons do not accept that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a has bestowed His favor upon a particular devotee in accordance with his advanced position. Such foolish persons become envious and try to minimize an advanced devotee&rsquo;s activities. That is not Vai&#7779;&#7751;avism. A Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava should appreciate the service rendered to the Lord by other Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas. Therefore a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is described in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> as <span class="Italic">nirmatsara.</span> Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas are never envious of other Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas or of anyone else, and therefore they are called <span class="Italic">nirmatsar&#257;&#7751;&#257;&#7745; sat&#257;m.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">As <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> informs us, one can understand how one is saturated with <span class="Italic">sattva-gu&#7751;a, rajo-gu&#7751;a</span> or <span class="Italic">tamo-gu&#7751;a.</span> In the examples given herewith, fire represents the mode of goodness. One can understand the constitution of a container for wood, petrol or other inflammable substances by the quantity of the fire. Similarly, water represents <span class="Italic">rajo-gu&#7751;a,</span> the mode of passion. A small skin and the vast Atlantic Ocean both contain water, and by seeing the quantity of water in a container one can understand the size of the container. The sky represents the mode of ignorance. The sky is present in a small earthen pot and also in outer space. Thus by proper judgment one can see who is a <span class="Italic">devat&#257;,</span> or demigod, and who is an <span class="Italic">asura,</span> Yak&#7779;a or R&#257;k&#7779;asa according to the quantities of <span class="Italic">sattva-gu&#7751;a, rajo-gu&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">tamo-gu&#7751;a.</span> One cannot judge whether a person is a <span class="Italic">devat&#257;,</span> an <span class="Italic">asura</span> or a R&#257;k&#7779;asa by seeing him, but a sane man can understand this by the activities such a person performs. A general description is given in <span class="Italic">the Padma Pur&#257;&#7751;a:</span> <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-bhakta&#7717; sm&#7771;to daiva &#257;suras tad-viparyaya&#7717;.</span> A devotee of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is a demigod, whereas an <span class="Italic">asura</span> or Yak&#7779;a is just the opposite. An <span class="Italic">asura</span> is not a devotee of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u; instead, for his sense gratification he is a devotee of the demigods, <span class="Italic">bh&#363;tas, pretas</span> and so on. Thus one can judge who is a <span class="Italic">devat&#257;,</span> who is a R&#257;k&#7779;asa and who is an <span class="Italic">asura</span> by how they conduct their activities.</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;nam</span> in this verse means <span class="Italic">param&#257;tm&#257;nam.</span> The Param&#257;tm&#257;, or Supersoul, is situated in the core of everyone&rsquo;s heart (<span class="Italic">antata&#7717;</span>). This is confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index0d72.html?g=5952">18.61</a>). <span class="Italic">&#298;&#347;vara&#7717; sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;n&#257;&#7745; h&#7771;d-de&#347;e &rsquo;rjuna ti&#7779;&#7789;hati.</span> The <span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;vara,</span> the Supreme Personality of Godhead, being situated in everyone&rsquo;s heart, gives directions to everyone in terms of one&rsquo;s capabilities in taking the instructions. The instructions of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> are open to everyone, but some people understand them properly, whereas others understand them so improperly that they cannot even believe in the existence of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, although reading K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s book. Although the <span class="Italic">G&#299;t&#257;</span> says <span class="Italic">&#347;r&#299;-bhagav&#257;n uv&#257;ca,</span> indicating that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a spoke, they cannot understand K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. This is due to their misfortune or incapability, which is caused by <span class="Italic">rajo-gu&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">tamo-gu&#7751;a,</span> the modes of passion and ignorance. It is because of these modes that they cannot even understand K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, whereas an advanced devotee like Arjuna understands Him and glorifies Him, saying, <span class="Italic">para&#7745; brahma para&#7745; dh&#257;ma pavitra&#7745; parama&#7745; bhav&#257;n:</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="index1ba6.html?g=3396">10.12</a></I>]</I> &ldquo;You are the Supreme Brahman, the supreme abode and purifier.&rdquo; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is open to everyone, but one needs the capability to understand Him.</div>
<div class="Purport">By external features one cannot understand who is favored by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and who is not. According to one&rsquo;s attitude, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a becomes one&rsquo;s direct adviser, or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a becomes unknown. This is not K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s partiality; it is His response to one&rsquo;s ability to understand Him. According to one&rsquo;s receptiveness&mdash;whether one be a <span class="Italic">devat&#257;, asura,</span> Yak&#7779;a or R&#257;k&#7779;asa&mdash;K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s quality is proportionately exhibited. This proportionate exhibition of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s power is misunderstood by less intelligent men to be K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s partiality, but actually it is no such thing. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is equal to everyone, and according to one&rsquo;s ability to receive the favor of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, one advances in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura gives a practical example in this connection. In the sky there are many luminaries. At night, even in darkness, the moon is extremely brilliant and can be directly perceived. The sun is also extremely brilliant. When covered by clouds, however, these luminaries are not distinctly visible. Similarly, the more one advances in <span class="Italic">sattva-gu&#7751;a,</span> the more his brilliance is exhibited by devotional service, but the more one is covered by <span class="Italic">rajo-gu&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">tamo-gu&#7751;a,</span> the less visible his brilliance, for he is covered by these qualities. The visibility of one&rsquo;s qualities does not depend on the partiality of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; it is due to various coverings in different proportions. Thus one can understand how far he has advanced in terms of <span class="Italic">sattva-gu&#7751;a</span> and how much he is covered by <span class="Italic">rajo-gu&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">tamo-gu&#7751;a.</span></div>

Then, as the Supersoul, He enters each body and influences the qualities of creation, maintenance and annihilation, using sattva-gu&#7751;a for maintenance, rajo-gu&#7751;a for creation and tamo-gu&#7751;a for annihilation.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">O great King, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the controller of the material and spiritual energies, who is certainly the creator of the entire cosmos, creates the time factor to allow the material energy and the living entity to act within the limits of time. Thus the Supreme Personality is never under the time factor nor under the material energy.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">One should not think that the Lord is dependent on the time factor. He actually creates the situation by which material nature acts and by which the conditioned soul is placed under material nature. Both the conditioned soul and the material nature act within the time factor, but the Lord is not subject to the actions and reactions of time, for time has been created by Him. To be more clear, &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura says that creation, maintenance and annihilation are all under the supreme will of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purport">In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexd622.html?g=1487">4.7</a>) the Lord says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">yad&#257; yad&#257; hi dharmasya<br>gl&#257;nir bhavati bh&#257;rata<br>abhyutth&#257;nam adharmasya<br>tad&#257;tm&#257;na&#7745; s&#7771;j&#257;my aham</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bh&#257;rata, and a predominant rise of irreligion&mdash;at that time I descend Myself.&rdquo; Since K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the controller of everything, when He appears He is not within the limitations of material time (<span class="Italic">janma karma ca me divyam</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexe89d.html?g=1505">4.9</a>]). In this verse the words <span class="Italic">k&#257;la&#7745; caranta&#7745; s&#7771;jat&#299;&#347;a &#257;&#347;rayam</span> indicate that although the Lord acts within time, whether <span class="Italic">sattva-gu&#7751;a, rajo-gu&#7751;a</span> or <span class="Italic">tamo-gu&#7751;a</span> is prominent, one should not think that the Lord is under time&rsquo;s control. Time is within His control, for He creates time to act in a certain way; He is not working under the control of time. The creation of the material world is one of the Lord&rsquo;s pastimes. Everything is fully under His control. Since creation takes place when <span class="Italic">rajo-gu&#7751;a</span> is prominent, the Lord creates the necessary time to give facilities for <span class="Italic">rajo-gu&#7751;a.</span> Similarly, He also creates the necessary times for maintenance and annihilation. Thus this verse establishes that the Lord is not under the limitations of time.</div>
<div class="Purport">As stated in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;, &#299;&#347;vara&#7717; parama&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&#7717;:</span> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the supreme controller. <span class="Italic">Sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha&#7717;: </I>[</I>Bs. </span>5.1</I>]</I> He possesses a blissful, spiritual body. <span class="Italic">An&#257;di&#7717;:</span> He is not subordinate to anything.

<div class="Purport">The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers say that this material world is <span class="Italic">mithy&#257;,</span> false, and that one should therefore not bother about this <span class="Italic">mithy&#257;</span> creation (<span class="Italic">brahma satya&#7745; jagan mithy&#257;</span>).

Here it is said, <span class="Italic">satya-k&#7771;t:</span> whatever is created by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, <span class="Italic">satya&#7745; param,</span> cannot be called <span class="Italic">mithy&#257;.</span> The cause of the creation is <span class="Italic">satya,</span> true, so how can the effect of the cause be <span class="Italic">mithy&#257;</span>? The very word <span class="Italic">satya-k&#7771;t</span> is used to establish that everything created by the Lord is factual, never false. The creation may be temporary, but it is not false.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">O King, this time factor enhances the sattva-gu&#7751;a. Thus although the Supreme Lord is the controller, He favors the demigods, who are mostly situated in sattva-gu&#7751;a. Then the demons, who are influenced by tamo-gu&#7751;a, are annihilated. The Supreme Lord induces the time factor to act in different ways, but He is never partial. Rather, His activities are glorious, therefore He is called Uru&#347;rav&#257;.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index90b5.html?g=3246">9.29</a>), <span class="Italic">samo&rsquo;ha&#7745; sarva-bh&#363;te&#7779;u na me dve&#7779;yo &rsquo;sti na priya&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all.&rdquo; The Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be partial; He is always equal to everyone. Therefore when the demigods are favored and the demons killed, this is not His partiality but the influence of the time factor. A good example in this regard is that an electrician connects both a heater and a cooler to the same electrical energy. The cause of the heating and cooling is the electrician&rsquo;s manipulation of the electrical energy according to his desire, but factually the electrician has nothing to do with causing heat or cold, nor with the enjoyment or suffering that results.</div>
<div class="Purport">There have been many historical incidents in which the Lord killed a demon, but the demon attained a higher position by the mercy of the Lord. P&#363;tan&#257; is an example. P&#363;tan&#257;&rsquo;s purpose was to kill K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. <span class="Italic">Aho bak&#299; ya&#7745; stana-k&#257;la-k&#363;&#7789;am.</span> She approached the house of Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja with the purpose of killing K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a by smearing poison on her breast, yet when she was killed she attained the highest position, achieving the status of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s mother. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is so kind and impartial that because he sucked P&#363;tan&#257;&rsquo;s breast, He immediately accepted her as His mother. This superfluous activity of killing P&#363;tan&#257; did not diminish the Lord&rsquo;s impartiality. He is <span class="Italic">suh&#7771;da&#7745; sama-bh&#363;t&#257;n&#257;m,</span> the friend of everyone. Therefore partiality cannot apply to the character of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who always maintains His position as the supreme controller. The Lord killed P&#363;tan&#257; as an enemy, but because of His being the supreme controller, she attained an exalted position as His mother. &#346;r&#299;la Madhva Muni therefore remarks, <span class="Italic">k&#257;le k&#257;la-vi&#7779;aye &rsquo;p&#299;&#347;it&#257;.</span> <span class="Italic">deh&#257;di-k&#257;ra&#7751;atv&#257;t sur&#257;n&#299;kam iva sthita&#7745; sattvam.</span> Ordinarily a murderer is hanged, and in the <span class="Italic">Manu-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> it is said that a king bestows mercy upon a murderer by killing him, thus saving him from various kinds of suffering. Because of his sinful activities, such a murderer is killed by the mercy of the king. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the supreme judge, deals with matters in a similar way because He is the supreme controller. The conclusion, therefore, is that the Lord is always impartial and always very kind to all living entities.</div>

<div class="Translation">The great sage &#346;r&#299; N&#257;radaj&#299; said: O King, blasphemy and praise, chastisement and respect, are experienced because of ignorance.

The conditioned soul, being seated on this machine, wanders throughout the universe, and because of his bodily conception of life he only suffers. Actually the suffering of being blasphemed and the enjoyment of being praised, the acceptance of a good welcome or of chastisement by harsh words, are felt in the material conception of life; but since the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not material but <span class="Italic">sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha</span><I> <span class="Italic"></I>[</I>Bs. </span>5.1</I>]<span class="Italic"></I>,</span> He is unaffected by insults or greetings, blasphemy or prayers.

Indeed, the Lord is very kind to His so-called enemy because one who always thinks of the Personality of Godhead as an enemy also benefits, although he thinks of the Lord adversely. If a conditioned soul, thinking of the Lord as an enemy or a friend, somehow or other becomes attached to the Lord, he receives great benefit.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Because of the bodily conception of life, the conditioned soul thinks that when the body is annihilated the living being is annihilated. Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the supreme controller, the Supersoul of all living entities. Because He has no material body, He has no false conception of &ldquo;I and mine.&rdquo; It is therefore incorrect to think that He feels pleasure or pain when blasphemed or offered prayers. This is impossible for Him. Thus He has no enemy and no friend. When He chastises the demons it is for their good, and when He accepts the prayers of the devotees it is for their good. He is affected neither by prayers nor by blasphemy.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Because of being covered by material bodies, the conditioned souls, including even greatly learned scholars and falsely educated professors, all think that as soon as the body is finished, everything is finished. This is due to their bodily conception of life. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a has no such bodily conception, nor is His body different from His self. Therefore, since K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a has no material conception of life, how can He be affected by material prayers and accusations? K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s body is described herewith as <span class="Italic">kaivalya,</span> nondifferent from Himself. Since everyone has a material bodily conception of life, if K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a had such a conception what would be the difference between K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and the conditioned soul? K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s instructions in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> are accepted as final because He does not possess a material body. As soon as one has a material body he has four deficiencies, but since K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a does not possess a material body, He has no deficiencies. He is always spiritually conscious and blissful. <span class="Italic">&#298;&#347;vara&#7717; parama&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&#7717; sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha&#7717; </I>[</I>Bs. </span>5.1</I>]<span class="Italic"></I>:</span> His form is eternal, blissful knowledge. <span class="Italic">Sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha&#7717;, &#257;nanda-cinmaya-rasa</span> and <span class="Italic">kaivalya</span> are the same.</div>
<div class="Purport">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a can expand Himself as Param&#257;tm&#257; in the core of everyone&rsquo;s heart. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexc1e9.html?g=4331">13.3</a>) this is confirmed. <span class="Italic">K&#7779;etraj&ntilde;a&#7745; c&#257;pi m&#257;&#7745; viddhi sama-k&#7779;etre&#7779;u bh&#257;rata:</span> the Lord is the Param&#257;tm&#257;&mdash;the <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;</span> or Superself of all individual souls. Therefore it must naturally be concluded that He has no defective bodily conceptions. Although situated in everyone&rsquo;s body, He has no bodily conception of life. He is always free from such conceptions, and thus He cannot be affected by anything in relation to the material body of the <span class="Italic">j&#299;va.</span></div>

<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">t&#257;n aha&#7745; dvi&#7779;ata&#7717; kr&#363;r&#257;n<br>sa&#7745;s&#257;re&#7779;u nar&#257;dham&#257;n<br>k&#7779;ip&#257;my ajasram a&#347;ubh&#257;n<br>&#257;sur&#299;&#7779;v eva yoni&#7779;u</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life.&rdquo; Whenever the Lord punishes persons like demons, however, such punishment is meant for the good of the conditioned soul. The conditioned soul, being envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, may accuse Him, saying, &ldquo;K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is bad, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is a thief&rdquo; and so on, but K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, being kind to all living entities, does not consider such accusations. Instead, He takes account of the conditioned soul&rsquo;s chanting of &ldquo;K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rdquo; so many times. He sometimes punishes such demons for one life by putting them in a lower species, but then, when they have stopped accusing Him, they are liberated in the next life because of chanting K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s name constantly. Blaspheming the Supreme Lord or His devotee is not at all good for the conditioned soul, but K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, being very kind, punishes the conditioned soul in one life for such sinful activities and then takes him back home, back to Godhead. The vivid example for this is V&#7771;tr&#257;sura, who was formerly Citraketu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, a great devotee. Because he derided Lord &#346;iva, the foremost of all devotees, he had to accept the body of a demon called V&#7771;tra, but then he was taken back to Godhead. Thus when K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a punishes a demon or conditioned soul, He stops that soul&rsquo;s habit of blaspheming Him, and when the soul becomes completely pure, the Lord takes him back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Therefore by enmity or by devotional service, by fear, by affection or by lusty desire&mdash;by all of these or any one of them&mdash;if a conditioned soul somehow or other concentrates his mind upon the Lord, the result is the same, for the Lord, because of His blissful position, is never affected by enmity or friendship.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">From this verse one should not conclude that because K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is unaffected by favorable prayers or unfavorable blasphemy one should therefore blaspheme the Supreme Lord. This is not the regulative principle. <span class="Italic">Bhakti-yoga</span> means <span class="Italic">&#257;nuk&#363;lyena k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;&#257;nu&#347;&#299;lanam:</span> one should serve K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a very favorably. This is the real injunction. Here it is said that although an enemy thinks of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a unfavorably, the Lord is unaffected by such antidevotional service. Thus He offers His benedictions even to &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la and similarly inimical conditioned souls. This does not mean, however, that one should be inimical toward the Lord. The stress is given to the favorable execution of devotional service, not purposeful blasphemy of the Lord. It is said:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">nind&#257;&#7745; bhagavata&#7717; &#347;&#7771;&#7751;va&#7745;s<br>tat-parasya janasya v&#257;<br>tato n&#257;paiti ya&#7717; so &rsquo;pi<br>y&#257;ty adha&#7717; suk&#7771;t&#257;c cyuta&#7717;</div>
<div class="After-Verse">One who hears blasphemy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His devotees should immediately take action or should leave. Otherwise he will be put into hellish life perpetually. There are many such injunctions. Therefore as a regulative principle one should not be unfavorable toward the Lord but always favorably inclined toward Him.</div>
<div class="Purport">&#346;i&#347;up&#257;la&rsquo;s achievement of oneness with the Supreme Lord was different because Jaya and Vijaya, from the very beginning of their material existence, were ordained to treat the Supreme Lord as an enemy for three lives and then return home, back to Godhead. Jaya and Vijaya inwardly knew that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but they purposely became His enemies to be delivered from material life. From the very beginning of their lives they thought of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as an enemy, and even though blaspheming Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, they chanted the holy name of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a constantly along with their inimical thoughts. Thus they were purified because of chanting the holy name of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. It is to be understood that even a blasphemer can be freed from sinful activities by chanting the holy name of the Lord. Certainly, therefore, freedom is assured for a devotee who is always favorable to the service of the Lord. This will be clear from the following verse. By rapt attention fixed upon K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, one is purified, and thus one is delivered from material life.</div>
<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura has very nicely explained the word <span class="Italic">bhayena,</span> which means &ldquo;by fear.&rdquo; When the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> went to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in the dead of night, they certainly feared chastisement by their relatives&mdash;their husbands, brothers and fathers&mdash;but nonetheless, not caring for their relatives, they went to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. There was certainly fear, but this fear could not check their devotional service to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>
<div class="Purport">One should not mistakenly think that Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a must be worshiped by an inimical attitude like that of &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la. The injunction is <span class="Italic">&#257;nuk&#363;lyasya graha&#7751;a&#7745; pr&#257;tik&#363;lyasya varjanam:</span> one should give up unfavorable activities and accept only favorable conditions in devotional service. Generally, if one blasphemes the Supreme Personality of Godhead he is punished. As the Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexeb92.html?g=5150">16.19</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">t&#257;n aha&#7745; dvi&#7779;ata&#7717; kr&#363;r&#257;n<br>sa&#7745;s&#257;re&#7779;u nar&#257;dham&#257;n<br>k&#7779;ip&#257;my ajasram a&#347;ubh&#257;n<br>&#257;sur&#299;&#7779;v eva yoni&#7779;u</div>
<div class="After-Verse">There are many such injunctions. One should not try to worship K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a unfavorably; otherwise he must be punished, at least for one life, to be purified. As one should not try to be killed by embracing an enemy, a tiger or a snake, one should not blaspheme the Supreme Personality of Godhead and become His enemy in order to be put into hellish life.</div>
<div class="Purport">The purpose of this verse is to emphasize that even the enemy of the Lord can be delivered, not to speak of His friend. &#346;r&#299;la Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya also says in many ways that one should not blaspheme Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u through one&rsquo;s mind, words or actions, for a blasphemer will go to hellish life along with his forefathers.</div>

Therefore by the grace of his son, Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was also delivered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">The conclusion is that one should not give up pure devotional service. For one&rsquo;s own benefit, one should not imitate Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu or &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la. This is not the way to achieve success.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">&#346;r&#299;m&#257;n N&#257;rada Muni, the topmost pure devotee, praises K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s enemies like &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la because their minds are always completely absorbed in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Indeed, he thinks himself deficient in the inspiration of being feelingly absorbed in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. This does not mean, however, that the enemies of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a are more elevated than K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s pure devotees. In the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">&#256;di</span> <a href="index42b5.html?g=85923">5.205</a>) K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;ad&#257;sa Kavir&#257;ja Gosv&#257;m&#299; also thinks of himself in such a humble way:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">jag&#257;i m&#257;dh&#257;i haite mu&ntilde;i se p&#257;pi&#7779;&#7789;ha<br>pur&#299;&#7779;era k&#299;&#7789;a haite mu&ntilde;i se laghi&#7779;&#7789;ha</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;I am a worse sinner than Jag&#257;i and M&#257;dh&#257;i and am even lower than the worms in the stool.&rdquo; A pure devotee always thinks himself more deficient than everyone else. If a devotee approaches &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;&#7751;&#299; to offer some service to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, even &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;&#7751;&#299; thinks that the devotee is greater than She. Thus N&#257;rada Muni says that according to his opinion the enemies of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a are better situated because they are fully absorbed in thoughts of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in terms of killing Him, just as a very lusty man always thinks of women and their association.</div>
<div class="Purport">The essential point in this connection is that one should be fully absorbed in thoughts of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, twenty-four hours a day. There are many devotees in <span class="Italic">r&#257;ga-m&#257;rga,</span> which is exhibited in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana. Whether in <span class="Italic">d&#257;sya-rasa, sakhya-rasa, v&#257;tsalya-rasa</span> or <span class="Italic">m&#257;dhurya-rasa,</span> all the devotees of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a are always overwhelmed by thoughts of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. When K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is away from V&#7771;nd&#257;vana tending the cows in the forest, the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s,</span> in the <span class="Italic">m&#257;dhurya-rasa,</span> are always absorbed in thoughts of how K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a walks in the forest. The soles of His feet are so soft that the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> would not dare keep His lotus feet on their soft breasts. Indeed, they consider their breasts a very hard place for the lotus feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, yet those lotus feet wander in the forest, which is full of thorny plants. The <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> are absorbed in such thoughts at home, although K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is away from them. Similarly, when K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a plays with His young friends, mother Ya&#347;od&#257; is very much disturbed by thoughts that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, because of always playing and not taking His food properly, must be getting weak. These are examples of the exalted ecstasy felt in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s service as manifested in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana. This service is indirectly praised by N&#257;rada Muni in this verse. Especially for the conditioned soul, N&#257;rada Muni recommends that one somehow or other be absorbed in thoughts of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, for that will save one from all the dangers of material existence. Full absorption in thought of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the highest platform of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span></div>

<div class="Translation">A grassworm confined in a hole of a wall by a bee always thinks of the bee in fear and enmity and later becomes a bee simply because of such remembrance.

Whether thinking of Him as their worshipable Lord or an enemy, because of constantly thinking of Him they will regain their spiritual bodies.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index1340.html?g=1514">4.10</a>) the Lord says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">v&#299;ta-r&#257;ga-bhaya-krodh&#257;<br>man-may&#257; m&#257;m up&#257;&#347;rit&#257;&#7717;<br>bahavo j&ntilde;&#257;na-tapas&#257;<br>p&#363;t&#257; mad-bh&#257;vam &#257;gat&#257;&#7717;</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Being freed from attachment, fear and anger, being fully absorbed in Me and taking refuge in Me, many, many persons in the past became purified by knowledge of Me&mdash;and thus they all attained transcendental love for Me.&rdquo; There are two ways of constantly thinking of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&mdash;as a devotee and as an enemy. A devotee, of course, by his knowledge and <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> becomes free from fear and anger and becomes a pure devotee. Similarly, an enemy, although thinking of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a inimically, thinks of Him constantly and also becomes purified. This is confirmed elsewhere in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexedd3.html?g=3255">9.30</a>), where the Lord says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">api cet su-dur&#257;c&#257;ro<br>bhajate m&#257;m ananya-bh&#257;k<br>s&#257;dhur eva sa mantavya&#7717;<br>samyag vyavasito hi sa&#7717;</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Even if one commits the most abominable actions, if he engages in devotional service he is to be considered saintly because he is properly situated.&rdquo; A devotee undoubtedly worships the Lord with rapt attention. Similarly, if an enemy (<span class="Italic">sudur&#257;c&#257;ra&#7717;</span>) always thinks of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, he also becomes a purified devotee. The example given here concerns the grassworm that becomes beelike because of constantly thinking of the bee that forces it to enter a hole. By always thinking of the bee in fear, the grassworm starts to become a bee. This is a practical example. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appears within this material world for two purposes&mdash;<span class="Italic">paritr&#257;&#7751;&#257;ya s&#257;dh&#363;n&#257;&#7745; vin&#257;&#347;&#257;ya ca du&#7779;k&#7771;t&#257;m:</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexb53f.html?g=1496">4.8</a>] to protect the devotees and annihilate the demons. The <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhus</span> and devotees certainly think of the Lord always, but <span class="Italic">du&#7779;k&#7771;t&#299;s,</span> the demons like Ka&#7745;sa and &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la, also think of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in terms of killing Him. By thinking of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, both the demons and devotees attain liberation from the clutches of material <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">This verse uses the word <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;-manuje.</span> When K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appears in His original spiritual potency (<span class="Italic">sambhav&#257;my &#257;tma-m&#257;yay&#257;</I> [Bg. </I><a href="index333e.html?g=1478">4.6</a></I>]</I></span>), He is not forced to accept a form made by material nature. Therefore the Lord is addressed as <span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;vara,</span> the controller of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> He is not controlled by <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> When a demon continuously thinks of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a because of enmity toward Him, he is certainly freed from the sinful reactions of his life. To think of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in any way, in terms of His name, form, qualities, paraphernalia or anything pertaining to Him, is beneficial for everyone. <span class="Italic">S&#7771;&#7751;vat&#257;&#7745; sva-kath&#257;&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&#7717; pu&#7751;ya-&#347;rava&#7751;a-k&#299;rtana&#7717;</I> [SB </I></span><a href="index03ec.html?g=6478">1.2.17</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> Thinking of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, hearing the holy name of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a or hearing the pastimes of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a will make one pure, and then he will become a devotee. Our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is therefore trying to introduce the system of somehow or other letting everyone hear the holy name of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and take K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da.</span> Thus one will gradually become a devotee, and his life will be successful.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>

If one who hears of the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span>&rsquo; lusty behavior with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a becomes free from lusty desires, certainly the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> who approached K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a became free from all such desires. Similarly, &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la and others who were very much envious of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and who constantly thought of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a became free from envy. Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and mother Ya&#347;od&#257; were fully absorbed in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness because of affection. When the mind is somehow or other fully absorbed in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the material part is very soon vanquished, and the spiritual part&mdash;attraction to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&mdash;becomes manifest. This indirectly confirms that if one thinks of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a enviously, simply because of thinking of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a he becomes free from all sinful reactions and thus becomes a pure devotee.

<div class="First">Different persons achieve different types of <span class="Italic">mukti&mdash;s&#257;yujya, s&#257;lokya, s&#257;r&#363;pya, s&#257;m&#299;pya</span> and <span class="Italic">s&#257;r&#7779;&#7789;i</span>&mdash;according to their own intense desire, which is called <span class="Italic">bh&#257;va.</span> Thus it is described here that the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s,</span> by their lusty desires, which were based upon their intense love for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, became the most beloved devotees of the Lord. Although the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> at V&#7771;nd&#257;vana expressed their lusty desires in relationship with a paramour (<span class="Italic">parak&#299;ya-rasa</span>), they actually had no lusty desires. This is significant of spiritual advancement. Their desires appeared lusty, but actually they were not the lusty desires of the material world. <span class="Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta</span> compares the desires of the spiritual and material world to gold and iron. Both gold and iron are metal, but there is a vast difference in their value. The lusty desires of the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a are compared to gold, and material lusty desires are compared to iron.</div>
<div class="Purport">Ka&#7745;sa and other enemies of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a merged into the existence of Brahman, but why should K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s friends and devotees have the same position? K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s devotees attain the association of the Lord as His constant companions, either in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana or in the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets. Similarly, although N&#257;rada Muni wanders in the three worlds, he has exalted devotion for N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a (<span class="Italic">ai&#347;varyam&#257;n</span>). The V&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;is and Yadus and the father and mother of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana all have familial relationships with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s foster father and mother in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, however, are more exalted than Vasudeva and Devak&#299;.</div>

<div class="Translation">Somehow or other, one must consider the form of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a very seriously.

Atheists like King Vena, however, being unable to think of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s form in any of these five ways, cannot attain salvation. Therefore, one must somehow think of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, whether in a friendly way or inimically.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Impersonalists and atheists always try to circumvent the form of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.

I have to kill Him.&rdquo; They think of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in His actual form, and thus they attain salvation. Devotees, therefore, who constantly think of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s form, are certainly liberated. The only business of the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; atheists is to make K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a formless, and consequently, because of this severe offense at the lotus feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, they cannot expect salvation. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura says in this connection: <span class="Italic">tena &#347;i&#347;up&#257;l&#257;di-bhinna&#7717; pratik&#363;la-bh&#257;va&#7745; didh&#299;&#7779;ur yena iva naraka&#7745; y&#257;t&#299;ti bh&#257;va&#7717;.</span> Except for &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la, those who go against the regulative principles cannot attain salvation and are surely destined for hellish life.

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">The bodies of the inhabitants of Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha are completely spiritual, having nothing to do with the material body, senses or life air. Therefore, kindly explain how associates of the Personality of Godhead were cursed to descend in material bodies like ordinary persons.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This very significant question would be difficult for an ordinary person to answer, but N&#257;rada Muni, being an authority, could answer it. Therefore Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira inquired from him, saying, <span class="Italic">etad &#257;khy&#257;tum arhasi:</span> &ldquo;only you can explain the reason.&rdquo; From authoritative sources it can be discerned that associates of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u who descend from Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha do not actually fall. They come with the purpose of fulfilling the desire of the Lord, and their descent to this material world is comparable to that of the Lord. The Lord comes to this material world through the agency of His internal potency, and similarly, when a devotee or associate of the Lord descends to this material world, he does so through the action of the spiritual energy. Any pastime conducted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is an arrangement by <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;,</span> not <span class="Italic">mah&#257;m&#257;y&#257;.</span> Therefore it is to be understood that when Jaya and Vijaya descended to this material world, they came because there was something to be done for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Otherwise it is a fact that no one falls from Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha.</div>
<div class="Purport">Of course, a living entity who desires <span class="Italic">s&#257;yujya-mukti</span> remains in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s Brahman effulgence, which is dependent on K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s body (<span class="Italic">brahma&#7751;o hi prati&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;ham </I>[Bg. </I></span><a href="index3746.html?g=4826">14.27</a></I><span class="Italic">]</I></span>). Such an impersonalist who takes shelter of the Brahman effulgence must surely fall down. This is stated in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="indexb411.html?g=76083">10.2.32</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">ye &rsquo;nye &rsquo;ravind&#257;k&#7779;a vimukta-m&#257;ninas<br>tvayy asta-bh&#257;v&#257;d avi&#347;uddha-buddhaya&#7717;<br>&#257;ruhya k&#7771;cchre&#7751;a para&#7745; pada&#7745; tata&#7717;<br>patanty adho &rsquo;n&#257;d&#7771;ta-yu&#7779;mad-a&#7749;ghraya&#7717;</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;O Lord, the intelligence of those who think themselves liberated but who have no devotion is impure. Even though they rise to the highest point of liberation by dint of severe penances and austerities, they are sure to fall down again into material existence, for they do not take shelter at Your lotus feet.&rdquo; The impersonalists cannot reach the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets to become associates of the Lord, and therefore, according to their desires, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a gives them <span class="Italic">s&#257;yujya-mukti.</span> However, since <span class="Italic">s&#257;yujya-mukti</span> is partial <span class="Italic">mukti,</span> they must fall again to this material world. When it is said that the individual soul falls from Brahmaloka, this applies to the impersonalist.</div>
<div class="Purport">From authoritative sources it is learned that Jaya and Vijaya were sent to this material world to fulfill the Lord&rsquo;s desire to fight. The Lord also sometimes wants to fight, but who can fight with the Lord but a very confidential devotee of the Lord? Jaya and Vijaya descended to this world to fulfill the Lord&rsquo;s desire. Therefore in each of their three births&mdash;first as Hira&#7751;y&#257;k&#7779;a and Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, second as R&#257;va&#7751;a and Kumbhakar&#7751;a, and third as &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la and Dantavakra&mdash;the Lord personally killed them. In other words, these associates of the Lord, Jaya and Vijaya, descended to the material world to serve the Lord by fulfilling His desire to fight. Otherwise, as Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira says, <span class="Italic">a&#347;raddheya iv&#257;bh&#257;ti:</span> the statement that a servant of the Lord could fall from Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha seems unbelievable. How Jaya and Vijaya came to this material world is explained by N&#257;rada Muni as follows.</div>

Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu reacted very sinfully by trying to diminish the religious activities of people in general. However, he instructed his nephews about a history just to diminish their aggrievement.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">When the Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared as the boar and killed Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu&rsquo;s brother Hira&#7751;y&#257;k&#7779;a, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was very much aggrieved. In anger, he accused the Supreme Personality of Godhead of being partial to His devotees and derided the Lord&rsquo;s appearance as Var&#257;ha to kill his brother. He began to agitate all the demons and R&#257;k&#7779;asas and disturb the ritualistic ceremonies of the peaceful sages and other inhabitants of earth. For want of the performance of <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a,</span> sacrifice, the demigods began wandering unseen on earth.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">After finishing the ritualistic funeral ceremonies of his brother, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu began speaking to his nephews, quoting from the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> about the truth of life. To pacify them, he spoke as follows: &ldquo;My dear nephews, for heroes to die before the enemy is glorious. According to their different fruitive activities, living entities come together within this material world and are again separated by the laws of nature. We should always know, however, that the spirit soul, which is different from the body, is eternal, unadjustable, pure, all-pervading and aware of everything. When bound by the material energy, the soul takes birth in higher or lower species of life according to varying association and in this way receives various types of bodies in which to suffer or enjoy. One&rsquo;s affliction by the conditions of material existence is the cause of happiness and distress; there are no other causes, and one should not be aggrieved upon seeing the superficial actions of <span class="Italic">karma.</span>&rdquo;</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu then related a historical incident concerning a King Suyaj&ntilde;a who resided in the country named U&#347;&#299;nara. When the King was killed, his queens, overwhelmed with grief, received instructions, which Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu quoted to his nephews. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu related an account of a <span class="Italic">kuli&#7749;ga</span> bird pierced by the arrow of a hunter while lamenting for his wife, who had also been shot by the same hunter. By narrating these stories, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu pacified his nephews and other relatives and relieved them of lamentation. Thus having been pacified, Diti and Ru&#7779;&#257;bh&#257;nu, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu&rsquo;s mother and sister-in-law, engaged their minds in spiritual understanding.</div>

<div class="Translation">My insignificant enemies the demigods have combined to kill my very dear and obedient well-wisher, my brother Hira&#7751;y&#257;k&#7779;a. Although the Supreme Lord, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, is always equal to both of us&mdash;namely, the demigods and the demons&mdash;this time, being devoutly worshiped by the demigods, He has taken their side and helped them kill Hira&#7751;y&#257;k&#7779;a.</div>

Since the demigods and demons are both living entities, how is it possible that the Lord was partial to one class of living beings and opposed to another? Actually it is not possible for the Lord to be partial. Nonetheless, since the demigods, the devotees, always strictly follow the Supreme Lord&rsquo;s orders, because of sincerity they are victorious over the demons, who know that the Supreme Lord is Vi&#7779;&#7751;u but do not follow His instructions. Because of constantly remembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the demons generally attain <span class="Italic">s&#257;yujya-mukti</span> after death. The demon Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu accused the Lord of being partial because the demigods worshiped Him, but in fact the Lord, like the government, is not partial at all. The government is not partial to any citizen, but if a citizen is law-abiding he receives abundant opportunities from the state laws to live peacefully and fulfill his real interests.</div>

<div class="Translation">The Supreme Personality of Godhead has given up His natural tendency of equality toward the demons and demigods. Although He is the Supreme Person, now, influenced by m&#257;y&#257;, He has assumed the form of a boar to please His devotees, the demigods, just as a restless child leans toward someone. I shall therefore sever Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&rsquo;s head from His trunk by my trident, and with the profuse blood from His body I shall please my brother Hira&#7751;y&#257;k&#7779;a, who was so fond of sucking blood. Thus shall I too be peaceful.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The defect of the demoniac mentality is expressed in this verse very clearly. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu thought that Vi&#7779;&#7751;u also becomes partial, like a child whose mind is not steady or resolute. The Lord can change His mind at any time, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu thought, and therefore His words and activities are like those of children. Actually, because the demons are ordinary human beings, their minds change, and being materially conditioned, they think that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is conditioned also. As the Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexa12b.html?g=3084">9.11</a>), <span class="Italic">avaj&#257;nanti m&#257;&#7745; m&#363;&#7693;h&#257; m&#257;nu&#7779;&#299;&#7745; tanum &#257;&#347;ritam:</span> &ldquo;Fools deride Me when I descend in a human form.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">Demons always think that Vi&#7779;&#7751;u can be killed. Therefore, being absorbed in thoughts of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&rsquo;s form to kill Him, at least they have the opportunity to think of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u unfavorably. Although they are not devotees, their thinking of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is effective, and thus they generally attain <span class="Italic">s&#257;yujya-mukti.</span> Because the demons consider the Supreme Lord an ordinary living being, they think that they can kill Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u as one might kill an ordinary person. Another fact disclosed herein is that demons are very much fond of sucking blood. Indeed, all of them are meat-eaters and bloodsuckers.</div>
<div class="Purport">Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu accused the Supreme Lord of having a restless mind like that of a small child who can be induced to do anything if simply offered some cakes and <span class="Italic">l&#257;&#7693;&#7693;us.</span> Indirectly, this indicates the true position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index8855.html?g=3219">9.26</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">patra&#7745; pu&#7779;pa&#7745; phala&#7745; toya&#7745;<br>yo me bhakty&#257; prayacchati<br>tad aha&#7745; bhakty-upah&#7771;tam<br>a&#347;n&#257;mi prayat&#257;tmana&#7717;</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it.&rdquo; The Lord accepts the offerings of devotees because of their transcendental love. Because they are in love with the Supreme Lord, they do not eat anything without offering it first to the Lord. The Lord does not hanker for a small leaf or flower; He has enough to eat. Indeed, He is feeding all living entities. Nonetheless, because He is very merciful and is <span class="Italic">bhakta-vatsala,</span> very favorable to the devotees, He certainly eats whatever they offer Him with love and devotion. This quality should not be misjudged to be childish. The highest quality of the Supreme Lord is that He is <span class="Italic">bhakta-vatsala;</span> in other words, He is always extremely pleased with His devotees. As for the word <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> when used in reference to the dealings of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotees, this word means &ldquo;affection.&rdquo; The actions of the Lord to favor His devotees are not disqualifications but signs of His natural affection.</div>
<div class="Purport">As for <span class="Italic">rudhira,</span> or the blood of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, since there is no possibility of severing Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&rsquo;s head from His body, there is no question of blood. But the garland that decorates Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&rsquo;s body is as red as blood. When the demons achieve <span class="Italic">s&#257;yujya-mukti</span> and leave behind their sinful activities, they are blessed by Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&rsquo;s garland, which is red like blood. After attaining <span class="Italic">s&#257;yujya-mukti,</span> the demons are sometimes promoted to the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha world, where they receive the reward of the Lord&rsquo;s garland <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da.</span></div>

<div class="First">Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu&rsquo;s main purpose was to disturb the demigods. He planned first to kill Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u so that with Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&rsquo;s death the demigods would automatically weaken and die. Another of his plans was to disturb the residents of the planet earth. The peace and prosperity of the residents of earth, and all the other planets, were maintained by the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas.</span> The Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexd112.html?g=1541">4.13</a>), <span class="Italic">c&#257;tur-var&#7751;ya&#7745; may&#257; s&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;a&#7745; gu&#7751;a-karma-vibh&#257;ga&#347;a&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;According to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by Me.&rdquo; On all the planets there are different types of residents, but the Lord recommends, referring especially to the planet earth, which is inhabited by human beings, that society be divided into four <span class="Italic">var&#7751;as&mdash;br&#257;hma&#7751;a, k&#7779;atriya, vai&#347;ya</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra.</span> Before the advent of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a on this earth, it is understood that the earth was managed by the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas.</span> The duty of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> is to cultivate <span class="Italic">&#347;ama&#7717;</span> (peacefulness), <span class="Italic">dama&#7717;</span> (self-control), <span class="Italic">titik&#7779;&#257;</span> (tolerance), <span class="Italic">satyam</span> (truthfulness), <span class="Italic">&#347;aucam</span> (cleanliness) and <span class="Italic">&#257;rjavam</span> (simplicity), and then to advise the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> kings how to rule the country or planet. Following the instructions of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> should engage the populace in austerity, sacrifices, Vedic study and adherence to the rules and regulations established by Vedic principles. They should also arrange for charity to be given to the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as, sanny&#257;s&#299;s</span> and temples. This is the godly arrangement of brahminical culture.</div>
<div class="Purport">People are inclined to offer <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a</span> because unless sacrifices are offered there will be insufficient rain (<span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;&#257;d bhavati parjanya&#7717;</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index3c8e.html?g=1158">3.14</a>]), which will hamper agricultural activities (<span class="Italic">parjany&#257;d anna-sambhava&#7717;</span>). By introducing brahminical culture, therefore, a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> government should engage people in performing <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a,</span> studying the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and giving charity. Thus the people will receive their necessities for life very easily, and there will be no disturbances in society. In this regard, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index731a.html?g=1140">3.12</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">i&#7779;&#7789;&#257;n bhog&#257;n hi vo dev&#257;<br>d&#257;syante yaj&ntilde;a-bh&#257;vit&#257;&#7717;<br>tair datt&#257;n aprad&#257;yaibhyo<br>yo bhu&#7749;kte stena eva sa&#7717;</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;In charge of the various necessities of life, the demigods, being satisfied by the performance of <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a</span> [sacrifice], supply all necessities to man. But he who enjoys these gifts, without offering them to the demigods in return, is certainly a thief.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">The demigods are authorized supplying agents who act on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Therefore, they must be satisfied by the performance of prescribed <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;as.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> there are different kinds of <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;as</span> prescribed for different kinds of demigods, but all are ultimately offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For one who cannot understand what the Personality of Godhead is, sacrifice to the demigods is recommended. According to the different material qualities of the persons concerned, different types of <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;as</span> are recommended in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> Worship of different demigods is also on the same basis&mdash;namely, according to different qualities. For example, the meat-eaters are recommended to worship the goddess K&#257;l&#299;, the ghastly form of material nature, and before the goddess the sacrifice of animals is recommended. But for those in the mode of goodness, the transcendental worship of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is recommended. Ultimately, all <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;as</span> are meant for gradual promotion to the transcendental position. For ordinary men, at least five <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;as,</span> known as <span class="Italic">pa&ntilde;ca-mah&#257;yaj&ntilde;a,</span> are necessary.</div>
<div class="Purport">One should know, however, that all the necessities of life that human society requires are supplied by the demigod agents of the Lord. No one can manufacture anything. Consider, for example, all the eatables of human society. These eatables include grains, fruits, vegetables, milk and sugar for persons in the mode of goodness, and also eatables for the nonvegetarians, such as meats, none of which can be manufactured by men. Then again, take for example, heat, light, water and air, which are also necessities of life&mdash;none of them can be manufactured by human society. Without the Supreme Lord, there can be no profuse sunlight, moonlight, rainfall or breeze, without which no one can live. Obviously, our life is dependent on supplies from the Lord. Even for our manufacturing enterprises, we require so many raw materials like metal, sulphur, mercury, manganese and so many essentials&mdash;all of which are supplied by the agents of the Lord, with the purpose that we should make proper use of them to keep ourselves fit and healthy for the purpose of self-realization, leading to the ultimate goal of life, namely, liberation from the material struggle for existence. This aim of life is attained by performance of <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;as.</span> If we forget the purpose of human life and simply take supplies from the agents of the Lord for sense gratification and become more and more entangled in material existence, which is not the purpose of creation, certainly we become thieves, and therefore we are punished by the laws of material nature. A society of thieves can never be happy, for they have no aim in life. The gross materialist thieves have no ultimate goal of life. They are simply directed to sense gratification; nor do they have knowledge of how to perform <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;as.</span> Lord Caitanya, however, inaugurated the easiest performance of <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a,</span> namely the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana-yaj&ntilde;a,</span> which can be performed by anyone in the world who accepts the principles of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purport">Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu planned to kill the inhabitants of earth so that <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a</span> would stop and the demigods, being disturbed, would die automatically when Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;e&#347;vara,</span> was killed.

<div class="Translation">The basic principle of brahminical culture is to satisfy Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the personification of sacrificial and ritualistic ceremonies. Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is the personified reservoir of all religious principles, and He is the shelter of all the demigods, the great pit&#257;s, and the people in general. When the br&#257;hma&#7751;as are killed, no one will exist to encourage the k&#7779;atriyas to perform yaj&ntilde;as, and thus the demigods, not being appeased by yaj&ntilde;a, will automatically die.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Since Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is the central point of brahminical culture, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu&rsquo;s plan was to kill Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, for if Vi&#7779;&#7751;u were killed, naturally the brahminical culture would also be lost. With brahminical culture lost, <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a</span> would no longer be performed, and for want of <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a</span> the regular distribution of rainfall would cease (<span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;&#257;d bhavati parjanya&#7717;</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index3c8e.html?g=1158">3.14</a>]). Thus there would be disturbances all over the world, and naturally the demigods would be defeated. From this verse we get a clear indication of how human society is disturbed when the Vedic &#256;ryan civilization is killed and the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies performed by the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are stopped. <span class="Italic">Kalau &#347;&#363;dra-sambhava&#7717;:</span> because the population of the modern world consists mostly of <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras,</span> the brahminical culture is now lost and is extremely difficult to reestablish in a proper way. Therefore Lord Caitanya has recommended the chanting of the holy name of the Lord, which will revive brahminical culture very easily.</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">harer n&#257;ma harer n&#257;ma<br>harer n&#257;maiva kevalam<br>kalau n&#257;sty eva n&#257;sty eva<br>n&#257;sty eva gatir anyath&#257;<br></I> [Adi </I><a href="indexd751.html?g=93741">17.21</a></I>]</I></div>
<div class="After-Verse">Because of the increment in demoniac population, people have lost brahminical culture. Nor is there a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> government. Instead, the government is a democracy in which any <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> can be voted into taking up the governmental reigns and capture the power to rule. Because of the poisonous effects of Kali-yuga, the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> 12.2.13) says, <span class="Italic">dasyu-pr&#257;ye&#7779;u r&#257;jasu:</span> the government will adopt the policies of <span class="Italic">dasyus,</span> or plunderers. Thus there will be no instructions from the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> and even if there are brahminical instructions, there will be no <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> rulers who can follow them. Aside from Satya-yuga, even formerly, in the days when demons were flourishing, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu planned to destroy the brahminical culture and the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> government and thus create chaos all over the world. Although in Satya-yuga this plan was very difficult to execute, in Kali-yuga, which is full of <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> and demons, the brahminical culture is lost and can be revived only by the chanting of the <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra.</span> Therefore the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, or the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a movement, has been inaugurated to revive brahminical culture very easily so that people may become happy and peaceful in this life and prepare for elevation in the next. In this regard, &#346;r&#299;la Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya quotes this verse from the <span class="Italic">Brahm&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a Pur&#257;&#7751;a:</span></div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;O King, the demons think that Hari, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, exists because of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a,</span> but factually Hari is the cause of everything including the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a.</span>&rdquo; Therefore, through the popularizing of <span class="Italic">hari-k&#299;rtana,</span> or the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> movement, the brahminical culture and <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> government will automatically come back, and people will be extremely happy.</div>

Set fire to those places and cut from the roots the trees there, which are the source of life.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The picture of a proper human civilization is indirectly described here. In a perfect human civilization there must be a class of men fully trained as perfect <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> Similarly, there must be <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> to rule the country very nicely according to the injunctions of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras,</span> and there must be <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas</span> who can protect the cows. The word <span class="Italic">g&#257;va&#7717;</span> indicates that cows should be given protection. Because the Vedic civilization is lost, cows are not protected, but instead indiscriminately killed in slaughterhouses. Such are the acts of demons. Therefore this is a demoniac civilization. The <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> mentioned here is essential for human civilization. Unless there is a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> to guide, a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> to rule perfectly, and a perfect <span class="Italic">vai&#347;ya</span> to produce food and protect the cows, how will people live peacefully? It is impossible.</div>
<div class="Purport">Another point is that trees also should be given protection. During its lifetime, a tree should not be cut for industrial enterprises. In Kali-yuga, trees are indiscriminately and unnecessarily cut for industry, in particular for paper mills that manufacture a profuse quantity of paper for the publication of demoniac propaganda, nonsensical literature, huge quantities of newspapers and many other paper products. This is a sign of a demoniac civilization. The cutting of trees is prohibited unless necessary for the service of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. <span class="Italic">Yaj&ntilde;&#257;rth&#257;t karma&#7751;o&rsquo;nyatra loko&rsquo;ya&#7745; karma-bandhana&#7717;:</I> [Bg. </I><a href="indexde01.html?g=1113">3.9</a></I>]</I></span>) &ldquo;work done as a sacrifice for Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u must be performed, otherwise work binds one to this material world.&rdquo; But if the paper mills stop producing paper, one may argue, how can our ISKCON literature be published? The answer is that the paper mills should manufacture paper only for the publication of ISKCON literature because ISKCON literature is published for the service of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. This literature clarifies our relationship with Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and therefore the publication of ISKCON literature is the performance of <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a.</span> <span class="Italic">Yaj&ntilde;&#257;rth&#257;t karma&#7751;o &rsquo;nyatra loko &rsquo;ya&#7745; karma-bandhana&#7717;</I> [Bg. </I><a href="indexde01.html?g=1113">3.9</a></I>]</I></span>)<span class="Italic">. Yaj&ntilde;a</span> must be performed, as indicated by the superior authorities. The cutting of trees simply to manufacture paper for the publication of unwanted literature is the greatest sinful act.</div>

Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu had clear knowledge of the spirit soul and the subtle and gross bodies, but now we are so degraded that everyone, including the exalted scientists, philosophers and other leaders, is under the bodily conception of life, which is condemned in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras.</span> <span class="Italic">Sa eva go-khara&#7717;:</I> [SB </span></I>10.84.13] such persons are nothing but cows and asses.</div>

<div class="Translation">In his bewildered state, the living entity, accepting the body and mind to be the self, considers some people to be his kinsmen and others to be outsiders. Because of this misconception, he suffers. Indeed, the accumulation of such concocted material ideas is the cause of suffering and so-called happiness in the material world. The conditioned soul thus situated must take birth in different species and work in various types of consciousness, thus creating new bodies. This continued material life is called sa&#7745;s&#257;ra. Birth, death, lamentation, foolishness and anxiety are due to such material considerations. Thus we sometimes come to a proper understanding and sometimes fall again to a wrong conception of life.</div>

<div class="First">Formerly, a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> king was generally the husband of many wives, and after the death of the king, especially in the battlefield, all the queens would agree to accept <span class="Italic">saha-m&#257;ra&#7751;a,</span> dying with the husband who was their life. When P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, the father of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, died, his two wives&mdash;namely, the mother of Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, Bh&#299;ma and Arjuna and the mother of Nakula and Sahadeva&mdash;were both ready to die in the fire with their husband. Later, after a compromise was arranged, Kunt&#299; stayed alive to care for the little children, and the other wife, M&#257;dr&#299;, was allowed to die with her husband. This system of <span class="Italic">saha-m&#257;ra&#7751;a</span> continued in India even until the time of British rule, but later it was discouraged, since the attitude of wives gradually changed with the advancement of Kali-yuga. Thus the system of <span class="Italic">saha-m&#257;ra&#7751;a</span> has practically been abolished. Nevertheless, within the past fifty years I have seen the wife of a medical practitioner voluntarily accept death immediately when her husband died. Both the husband and wife were taken in procession in the mourning cart. Such intense love of a chaste wife for her husband is a special case.</div>

<div class="Translation">The time was appropriate for the body to be burned, but the queens, not allowing it to be taken away, continued lamenting for the dead body, which they kept on their laps. In the meantime, the sun completed its movements for setting in the west.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to the Vedic system, if a person dies during the daytime it is customary for his funeral ceremony to be performed before the sun sets, regardless of whether he is burned or buried, and if he dies at night the funeral must be completed before the next sunrise. Apparently the queens continued lamenting for the dead body, the lump of matter, and would not allow it to be taken away for burning. This illustrates the strong grip of illusion among foolish persons who consider the body the self. Women are generally considered less intelligent. Because of ignorance only, the queens thought of the dead body as their husband and somehow or other thought that if the body were kept their husband would remain with them. Such a conception of the self is certainly for <span class="Italic">go-khara</span>&mdash;cows and asses. We have actually seen that sometimes when a cow&rsquo;s calf has died the milkman cheats the cow by presenting before her the dead body of her calf. Thus the cow, who would not otherwise allow milking, licks the dead body of the calf and allows herself to be milked. This substantiates the description of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra</span> that a foolish man in the bodily concept of life is like a cow. Not only do foolish men and women consider the body the self, but we have even seen that the dead body of a so-called <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> was kept for days by his disciples, who thought that their <span class="Italic">guru</span> was in <span class="Italic">sam&#257;dhi.</span> When decomposition began and a bad smell unfortunately began to overwhelm the yogic power, the disciples allowed the dead body of the so-called <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> to be burned. Thus the bodily concept of life is extremely strong among foolish persons, who are compared to cows and asses. Nowadays, great scientists are trying to freeze dead bodies so that in the future these frozen bodies may again be brought to life. The incident narrated by Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu from history must have taken place millions of years ago because Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu lived millions of years ago and was even then quoting from history. Thus the incident occurred before Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu&rsquo;s lifetime, but the same ignorance in the bodily concept of life is still prevalent, not only among laymen but even among scientists who think they will be able to revive frozen corpses.</div>
<div class="Purport">Apparently the queens did not want to deliver the dead body for burning because they were afraid of dying with the dead body of their husband.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Sometimes the living entity is forced to give up his body and enter another one according to the judgment of Yamar&#257;ja. It is difficult, however, for the conditioned soul to enter another body unless the present dead body is annihilated through cremation or some other means. The living being has attachment for the present body and does not want to enter another, and thus in the interim he remains a ghost. If a living being who has already left his body has been pious, Yamar&#257;ja, just to give him relief, will give him another body. Since the living being in the body of the King had some attachment to his body, he was hovering as a ghost, and therefore Yamar&#257;ja, as a special consideration, approached the lamenting relatives to instruct them personally. Yamar&#257;ja approached them as a child because a child is not restricted but is granted admittance anywhere, even to the palace of a king. Besides this, the child was speaking philosophy. People are very much interested in hearing philosophy when it is spoken by a child.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;All created beings are unmanifest in their beginning, manifest in their interim state, and unmanifest again when they are annihilated. So what need is there for lamentation?&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">Accepting that there are two classes of philosophers, one believing in the existence of the soul and the other not believing in its existence, there is no cause for lamentation in either case. Nonbelievers in the existence of the soul are called atheists by followers of Vedic wisdom. Yet even if for argument&rsquo;s sake we accept the atheistic theory, there is still no cause for lamentation. Apart from the separate existence of the soul, the material elements remain unmanifested before creation. From this subtle state of unmanifestation comes manifestation, just as from ether, air is generated; from air, fire is generated; from fire, water is generated; and from water, earth becomes manifested. From the earth, many varieties of manifestations take place. For example, a big skyscraper is manifested from the earth. When it is dismantled, the manifestation becomes again unmanifested and remains as atoms in the ultimate stage. The law of conservation of energy remains, but in the course of time things are manifested and unmanifested&mdash;that is the difference. Then what cause is there for lamentation, in either manifestation or unmanifestation? Somehow or other, even in the unmanifested stage, things are not lost. Both at the beginning and at the end, all elements remain unmanifested, and this does not make any real material difference.</div>
<div class="Purport">If we accept the Vedic conclusion as stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">antavanta ime deh&#257;&#7717;</span>) that these material bodies are perishable in due course of time (<span class="Italic">nityasyokt&#257;&#7717; &#347;ar&#299;ri&#7751;a&#7717;</span>) but that the soul is eternal, then we must remember always that the body is like a dress; therefore why lament the changing of a dress? The material body has no factual existence in relation to the eternal soul. It is something like a dream. In a dream we may think of flying in the sky or sitting on a chariot as a king, but when we wake up we can see that we are neither in the sky nor seated on the chariot. The Vedic wisdom encourages self-realization on the basis of the nonexistence of the material body. Therefore, in either case, whether one believes in the existence of the soul or one does not believe in the existence of the soul, there is no cause for lamentation for loss of the body.</div>
<div class="Purport">In the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">adar&#347;an&#257;d ih&#257;y&#257;ta&#7717; puna&#347; c&#257;dar&#347;ana&#7745; gata&#7717;.</span> This statement could support the theory of the atheistic scientist that the child in the womb of the mother has no life but is simply a lump of matter. To follow this theory, if the lump of matter is aborted by a surgical operation, no life is killed; the body of a child is like a tumor, and if a tumor is operated upon and thrown away, no sin is involved. The same argument could be put forward in regard to the King and his queens. The body of the King was manifested from an unmanifested source, and again it became unmanifested from manifestation. Since the manifestation exists only in the middle&mdash;between the two points of unmanifestation&mdash;why should one cry for the body manifested in the interim?</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In this regard the queens might argue, &ldquo;If our husband was protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead when in the womb, why has he not been given protection now?&rdquo; To this question the answer is, <span class="Italic">ya icchaye&#347;a&#7717; s&#7771;jat&#299;dam avyayo ya eva rak&#7779;aty avalumpate ca ya&#7717;.</span> One cannot argue with the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is always free, and therefore He can protect and can also annihilate. He is not our order carrier; whatever He likes He will do. Therefore He is the Supreme Lord. The Lord does not create this material world at anyone&rsquo;s request, and therefore He can annihilate everything merely by His will. That is His supremacy. If one argues, &ldquo;Why does He act in this way?&rdquo; the answer is that He can do so because He is supreme. No one can question His activities. If one argues, &ldquo;What is the purpose of this sinful creation and annihilation?&rdquo; the answer is that to prove His omnipotence He can do anything, and no one can question Him. If He were answerable to us concerning why He does something and why He does not, His supremacy would be curtailed.</div>

<div class="Translation">Sometimes one loses his money on a public street, where everyone can see it, and yet his money is protected by destiny and not seen by others. Thus the man who lost it gets it back. On the other hand, if the Lord does not give protection, even money maintained very securely at home is lost. If the Supreme Lord gives one protection, even though one has no protector and is in the jungle, one remains alive, whereas a person well protected at home by relatives and others sometimes dies, no one being able to protect him.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">These are examples of the supremacy of the Lord. Our plans to protect or annihilate do not act, but whatever He thinks of doing actually happens. The examples given in this regard are practical. Everyone has had such practical experiences, and there are also many other clear examples. For instance, Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja said that a child is certainly dependent on his father and mother, but in spite of their presence, the child is harassed in many ways. Sometimes, in spite of a supply of good medicine and an experienced physician, a patient does not survive. Therefore, since everything is dependent on the free will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, our only duty is to surrender unto Him and seek His protection.</div>

<div class="Translation">Every conditioned soul receives a different type of body according to his work, and when the engagement is finished the body is finished. Although the spirit soul is situated in subtle and gross material bodies in different forms of life, he is not bound by them, for he is always understood to be completely different from the manifested body.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Here it is very plainly explained that God is not responsible for the living entity&rsquo;s accepting different types of bodies. One has to accept a body according to the laws of nature and one&rsquo;s own <span class="Italic">karma.</span> Therefore the Vedic injunction is that a person engaged in material activities should be given directions by which he can intelligently apply his activities to the service of the Lord to become free from the material bondage of repeated birth and death (<span class="Italic">sva-karma&#7751;&#257; tam abhyarcya siddhi&#7745; vindati m&#257;nava&#7717;</span>). The Lord is always ready to give directions. Indeed, His directions are elaborately given in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> If we take advantage of these directions, then in spite of our being conditioned by the laws of material nature, we shall become free to attain our original constitution (<span class="Italic">m&#257;m eva ye prapadyante m&#257;y&#257;m et&#257;&#7745; taranti te</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexd990.html?g=2586">7.14</a>]). We should have firm faith that the Lord is supreme and that if we surrender to Him, He will take charge of us and indicate how we can get out of material life and return home, back to Godhead. Without such surrender, one is obliged to accept a certain type of body according to his <span class="Italic">karma,</span> sometimes as an animal, sometimes a demigod and so on. Although the body is obtained and lost in due course of time, the spirit soul does not actually mix with the body, but is subjugated by the particular modes of nature with which he is sinfully associated. Spiritual education changes one&rsquo;s consciousness so that one simply carries out the orders of the Supreme Lord and becomes free from the influence of the modes of material nature.</div>

<div class="First">We transmigrate from one body to another in bodies that are products of our illusion, but as spirit souls we always exist separately from material, conditional life. The example given here is that a house or car is always different from its owner, but because of attachment the conditioned soul thinks it to be identical with him. A car or house is actually made of material elements; as long as the material elements combine together properly, the car or house exists, and when they are disassembled the house or the car is disassembled. The spirit soul, however, always remains as he is.</div>

<div class="Translation">As fire, although situated in wood, is perceived to be different from the wood, as air, although situated within the mouth and nostrils, is perceived to be separate, and as the sky, although all-pervading, never mixes with anything, so the living entity, although now encaged within the material body, of which it is the source, is separate from it.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the Supreme Personality of Godhead has explained that the material energy and spiritual energy both emanate from Him.

But although the eight gross and subtle material energies&mdash;namely, earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego&mdash;are stated to be <span class="Italic">bhinn&#257;,</span> separate from the Lord, actually they are not. As fire appears separate from wood and as the air flowing through the nostrils and mouth of the body appear separate from the body, so the Param&#257;tm&#257;, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appears separate from the living being but is actually separate and not separate simultaneously. This is the philosophy of <span class="Italic"> propounded by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. According to the reactions of <span class="Italic">karma,</span> the living being appears separate from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but actually he is very intimately related with the Lord. Consequently, even though we now seem neglected by the Lord, He is actually always alert to our activities. Under all circumstances, therefore, we should simply depend on the supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus revive our intimate relationship with Him. We must depend upon the authority and control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

After death, when the breath within the nostrils has stopped, one can understand that the person within the body, who was hearing and replying, has now gone. Therefore, in effect, the common man concludes that actually the spirit soul was different from the body and has now gone away. Thus even a common man, coming to his senses, can know that the real person who was within the body and was hearing and replying was never seen.

<div class="Translation">In the body the most important substance is the life air, but that also is neither the listener nor the speaker.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Supreme Personality of Godhead distinctly says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a>), <span class="Italic">sarvasya c&#257;ha&#7745; h&#7771;di sannivi&#7779;&#7789;o matta&#7717; sm&#7771;tir j&ntilde;&#257;nam apohana&#7745; ca:</span> &ldquo;I am seated in everyone&rsquo;s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.&rdquo; Although the <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;,</span> or soul, is present in every material body (<span class="Italic">dehino &rsquo;smin yath&#257; dehe</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexf962.html?g=502">2.13</a></I><span class="Italic">]</I></span>), he is not actually the chief person acting through the senses, mind and so on. The soul can merely act in cooperation with the Supersoul because it is the Supersoul who gives him directions to act or not to act (<span class="Italic">matta&#7717; sm&#7771;tir j&ntilde;&#257;nam apohana&#7745; ca</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a></I>]</I>). One cannot act without His sanction, for the Supersoul is <span class="Italic">upadra&#7779;&#7789;&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">anumant&#257;,</span> the witness and sanctioner. One who studies carefully, under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master, can understand the real knowledge that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is actually the conductor of all the activities of the individual soul, and the controller of their results as well. Although the individual soul possesses the <span class="Italic">indriyas,</span> or senses, he is not actually the proprietor, for the proprietor is the Supersoul. Consequently the Supersoul is called H&#7771;&#7779;&#299;ke&#347;a, and the individual soul is advised by the direction of the Supersoul to surrender to Him and thus be happy (<span class="Italic">sama-dharm&#257;n parityajya m&#257;m eka&#7745; &#347;ara&#7751;a&#7745; vraja</span>). Thus he can become immortal and be transferred to the spiritual kingdom, where he will achieve the highest success of an eternal, blissful life of knowledge. In conclusion, the individual soul is different from the body, senses, living force and the airs within the body, and above him is the Supersoul, who gives the individual soul all facilities. The individual soul who renders everything to the Supersoul lives very happily within the body.</div>

<div class="Translation">The five material elements, the ten senses and the mind all combine to form the various parts of the gross and subtle bodies. The living entity comes in contact with his material bodies, whether high or low, and later gives them up by his personal prowess. This strength can be perceived in a living entity&rsquo;s personal power to possess different types of bodies.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The conditioned soul has knowledge, and if he wants to fully utilize the gross and subtle bodies for his real advancement in life, he can do so. It is therefore said here that by his high intelligence (<span class="Italic">svena tejas&#257;</span>), by the superior power of superior knowledge achieved from the right source&mdash;the spiritual master, or <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya</span>&mdash;he can give up his conditional life in a material body and return home, back to Godhead. However, if he wants to keep himself in the darkness of this material world, he can do so. The Lord confirms this as follows in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index0567.html?g=3210">9.25</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">y&#257;nti deva-vrat&#257; dev&#257;n<br>pit&#7773;n y&#257;nti pit&#7771;-vrat&#257;&#7717;<br>bh&#363;t&#257;ni y&#257;nti bh&#363;tejy&#257;<br>y&#257;nti mad-y&#257;jino &rsquo;pi m&#257;m</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Those who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods; those who worship ghosts and spirits will take birth among such beings; those who worship ancestors go to the ancestors; and those who worship Me will live with Me.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">The human form of body is valuable. One can use this body to go to the higher planetary systems, to Pit&#7771;loka, or he can remain in this lower planetary system, but if one tries he can also return home, back to Godhead. This prowess is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the Supersoul. Therefore the Lord says, <span class="Italic">matta&#7717; sm&#7771;tir j&ntilde;&#257;nam apohana&#7745; ca:</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a></I>]</I> &ldquo;From Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.&rdquo; If one wants to receive real knowledge from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can become free from bondage to repeated acceptance of material bodies. If one takes to the devotional service of the Lord and surrenders unto Him, the Lord is prepared to give one directions by which to return home, back to Godhead, but if one foolishly wants to keep himself in darkness, he can continue in a life of material existence.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">As long as the spirit soul is covered by the subtle body, consisting of the mind, intelligence and false ego, he is bound to the results of his fruitive activities. Because of this covering, the spirit soul is connected with the material energy and must accordingly suffer material conditions and reversals, continually, life after life.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The living entity is bound by the subtle body, consisting of the mind, intelligence and false ego. At the time of death, therefore, the position of the mind becomes the cause for the next body. As confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index473d.html?g=2787">8.6</a>), <span class="Italic">ya&#7745; ya&#7745; v&#257;pi smaran bh&#257;va&#7745; tyajaty ante kalevaram:</span> at the time of death the mind sets the criteria for the spirit soul&rsquo;s being carried to another type of body. If a living being resists the dictation of the mind and engages the mind in the loving service of the Lord, the mind cannot degrade him. The duty of all human beings, therefore, is to keep the mind always engaged at the lotus feet of the Lord (<span class="Italic">sa vai mana&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-pad&#257;ravindayo&#7717;</span>). When the mind is engaged at the lotus feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the intelligence is purified, and then the intelligence gets inspiration from the Supersoul (<span class="Italic">dad&#257;mi buddhi-yoga&#7745; tam</span>). Thus the living entity makes progress toward liberation from material bondage. The individual living soul is subject to the laws of fruitive activity, but the Supersoul, Param&#257;tm&#257;, is not affected by the fruitive activities of the individual soul. As confirmed in the Vedic <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ad,</span> the Param&#257;tm&#257; and the <span class="Italic">j&#299;v&#257;tm&#257;,</span> who are likened to two birds, are sitting in the body. The <span class="Italic">j&#299;v&#257;tm&#257;</span> is enjoying or suffering by eating the fruits of the bodily activities, but the Param&#257;tm&#257;, who is free from such bondage, witnesses and sanctions the activities of the individual soul as the individual soul desires.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">It is fruitless to see and talk of the material modes of nature and their resultant so-called happiness and distress as if they were factual. When the mind wanders during the day and a man begins to think himself extremely important, or when he dreams at night and sees a beautiful woman enjoying with him, these are merely false dreams. Similarly, the happiness and distress caused by the material senses should be understood to be meaningless.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The happiness and distress derived from the activities of the material senses are not actual happiness and distress. Therefore <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> speaks of happiness that is transcendental to the material conception of life (<span class="Italic">sukham &#257;tyantika&#7745; yat tad buddhi-gr&#257;hyam at&#299;ndriyam</span>). When our senses are purified of material contamination, they become <span class="Italic">at&#299;ndriya,</span> transcendental senses, and when the transcendental senses are engaged in the service of the master of the senses, H&#7771;&#7779;&#299;ke&#347;a, one can derive real transcendental pleasure. Whatever distress or happiness we manufacture by mental concoction through the subtle mind has no reality, but is simply a mental concoction. One should therefore not imagine so-called happiness through mental concoction. Rather, the best course is to engage the mind in the service of the Lord, H&#7771;&#7779;&#299;ke&#347;a, and thus feel real blissful life.</div>
<div class="Purport">There is a Vedic statement <span class="Italic">ap&#257;ma-somam am&#7771;t&#257; abh&#363;ma apsarobhir vihar&#257;ma.</span> With reference to such a conception, one wants to go to the heavenly planets to enjoy with the young girls there and drink <span class="Italic">soma-rasa.</span> Such imaginary pleasure, however, has no value. As confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index6165.html?g=2667">7.23</a>), <span class="Italic">antavat tu phala&#7745; te&#7779;&#257;&#7745; tad bhavaty alpa-medhas&#257;m:</span> &ldquo;Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary.&rdquo; Even if by fruitive activity or worship of the demigods one is elevated to the higher planetary systems for sense enjoyment, his situation is condemned in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as <span class="Italic">antavat,</span> perishable. The happiness one enjoys in this way is like the pleasure of embracing a young woman in a dream; for some time it may be pleasing, but actually the basic principle is false. The mental concoctions of happiness and distress in this material world are compared to dreams because of their falseness. All thoughts of obtaining happiness by using the material senses have a false background and therefore have no meaning.</div>

<div class="Translation">The unfortunate baby birds, bereft of their mother, are waiting in the nest for her to feed them. They are still very small and have not yet grown their wings. How shall I be able to maintain them?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The bird is lamenting for the mother of his children because the mother naturally maintains and cares for the children. Yamar&#257;ja, however, in the guise of a small boy, has already explained that although his mother left him uncared for and wandering in the forest, the tigers and other ferocious animals had not eaten him. The real fact is that if the Supreme Personality of Godhead protects one, even though one be motherless and fatherless, one can be maintained by the good will of the Lord. Otherwise, if the Supreme Lord does not give one protection, one must suffer in spite of the presence of his father and mother. Another example is that sometimes a patient dies in spite of a good physician and good medicine. Thus without the protection of the Lord one cannot live, with or without parents.</div>
<div class="Purport">Another point in this verse is that fathers and mothers have protective feelings for their children even in bird and beast society, not to speak of human society. Kali-yuga, however, is so degraded that a father and mother even kill their children in the womb on the plea of their scientific knowledge that within the womb the child has no life. Prestigious medical practitioners give this opinion, and therefore the father and mother of this day kill their children within the womb. How degraded human society has become! Their scientific knowledge is so advanced that they think that within the egg and the embryo there is no life. Now these so-called scientists are receiving Nobel Prizes for advancing the theory of chemical evolution. But if chemical combinations are the source of life, why don&rsquo;t the scientists manufacture something like an egg through chemistry and put it in an incubator so that a chicken will come out? What is their answer? With their scientific knowledge they are unable to create even an egg. Such scientists are described in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as <span class="Italic">m&#257;yay&#257;pah&#7771;ta j&ntilde;&#257;n&#257;&#7717;,</span> fools whose real knowledge has been taken away. They are not men of knowledge, but they pose as scientists and philosophers, although their so-called theoretical knowledge cannot produce practical results.</div>

<div class="First">This is confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexdbe0.html?g=547">2.18</a>). <span class="Italic">Antavanta ime deh&#257; nityasyokt&#257;&#7717; &#347;ar&#299;ri&#7751;a&#7717;:</span> the body is perishable, but the soul within the body is imperishable. Therefore the duty of those advanced in knowledge in human society is to study the constitutional position of the imperishable soul and not waste the valuable time of human life in merely maintaining the body and not considering life&rsquo;s real responsibility. Every human being should try to understand how the spirit soul can be happy and where he can attain an eternal, blissful life of knowledge. Human beings are meant to study these subject matters, not to be absorbed in caring for the temporary body, which is sure to change. No one knows whether he will receive a human body again; there is no guarantee, for according to one&rsquo;s work one may get any body, from that of a demigod to that of a dog.

<div class="Translation">Therefore none of you should be aggrieved for the loss of the body&mdash;whether your own or those of others. Only in ignorance does one make bodily distinctions, thinking &ldquo;Who am I? Who are the others? What is mine? What is for others?&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In this material world, the conception of self-preservation is the first law of nature. According to this conception, one should be interested in his personal safety and should then consider society, friendship, love, nationality, community and so on, which have all developed because of the bodily conception of life and a lack of knowledge of the spirit soul. This is called <span class="Italic">aj&ntilde;&#257;na.</span> As long as human society is in darkness and ignorance, men will continue to make huge arrangements in the bodily conception of life. This is described by Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja as <span class="Italic">bharam.</span> In the materialistic conception, modern civilization makes enormous arrangements for huge roads, houses, mills and factories, and this is man&rsquo;s conception of the advancement of civilization. People do not know, however, that at any time they themselves may be kicked out of the scene and forced to accept bodies that have nothing to do with these enormous houses, palaces, roads and automobiles. Therefore when Arjuna was thinking in terms of his bodily relationships with his kinsmen, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a immediately chastised him, saying, <span class="Italic">kutas tv&#257; ka&#347;malam ida&#7745; vi&#7779;ame samupasthitam an&#257;rya ju&#7779;&#7789;am:</span> &ldquo;This bodily conception of life is befitting the <span class="Italic">an&#257;ryas,</span> the non-&#256;ryans, who are not advanced in knowledge.&rdquo; An &#256;ryan civilization is a civilization advanced in spiritual knowledge. Not merely by stamping oneself an &#256;ryan does one become an &#256;ryan. To keep oneself in the deepest darkness concerning spiritual knowledge and at the same time claim to be an &#256;ryan is a non-&#256;ryan position.

<div class="After-Verse">The purport is that as long as we are in this human form of body, our duty is to understand the soul within the body. The body is not the self; we are different from the body, and therefore there is no question of friends, enemies or responsibilities in terms of the bodily conception of life. One should not be very anxious about the body&rsquo;s changing from childhood to boyhood, from boyhood to old age and then to apparent annihilation. Rather, one should be very seriously concerned about the soul within the body and how to release the soul from the material clutches. The living entity within the body is never annihilated; therefore one should surely know that whether one has many friends or many enemies, his friends cannot help him, and his enemies cannot do him any harm. One should know that he is a spirit soul (<span class="Italic">) and that the constitutional position of the soul is unaffected by the changes of the body. In all circumstances, everyone, as a spirit soul, must be a devotee of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and should not be concerned with bodily relationships, whether with friends or with enemies. One should know that neither we ourselves nor our enemies in the bodily conception of life are ever killed.</div>

She then forgot her grief over her son&rsquo;s death and thus engaged her mind and attention in understanding the real philosophy of life.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">When a relative dies one certainly becomes very much interested in philosophy, but when the funeral ceremony is over one again becomes attentive to materialism. Even Daityas, who are materialistic persons, sometimes think of philosophy when some relative meets death. The technical term for this attitude of the materialistic person is <span class="Italic">&#347;ma&#347;&#257;na-vair&#257;gya,</span> or detachment in a cemetery or place of cremation. As confirmed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> four classes of men receive an understanding of spiritual life and God&mdash;<span class="Italic">&#257;rta</span> (the distressed), <span class="Italic">jij&ntilde;&#257;su</span> (the inquisitive), <span class="Italic">arth&#257;rth&#299;</span> (one who desires material gains) and <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;</span> (one who is searching for knowledge). Especially when one is very much distressed by material conditions, one becomes interested in God. Therefore Kunt&#299;dev&#299; said in her prayers to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a that she preferred distress to a happy mood of life. In the material world, one who is happy forgets K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, or God, but sometimes, if one is actually pious but in distress, he remembers K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Queen Kunt&#299;dev&#299; therefore preferred distress because it is an opportunity for remembering K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. When K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was leaving Kunt&#299;dev&#299; for His own country, Kunt&#299;dev&#299; regretfully said that she was better off in distress because K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was always present, whereas now that the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas were situated in their kingdom, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was going away. For a devotee, distress is an opportunity to remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead constantly.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This chapter describes how Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu performed a severe type of austerity for material benefit, thus causing great distress throughout the universe. Even Lord Brahm&#257;, the chief personality within this universe, became somewhat disturbed and personally went to see why Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was engaged in such a severe austerity.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu wanted to become immortal. He wanted not to be conquered by anyone, not to be attacked by old age and disease, and not to be harassed by any opponent. Thus he wanted to become the absolute ruler of the entire universe. With this desire, he entered the valley of Mandara Mountain and began practicing a severe type of austerity and meditation. Seeing Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu engaged in this austerity, the demigods returned to their respective homes, but while Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was thus engaged, a kind of fire began blazing from his head, disturbing the entire universe and its inhabitants, including the birds, beasts and demigods. When all the higher and lower planets became too hot to live on, the demigods, being disturbed, left their abodes in the higher planets and went to see Lord Brahm&#257;, praying to him that he curtail this unnecessary heat. The demigods disclosed to Lord Brahm&#257; Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu&rsquo;s ambition to become immortal, overcoming his short duration of life, and to be the master of all the planetary systems, even Dhruvaloka.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Upon hearing about the purpose of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu&rsquo;s austere meditation, Lord Brahm&#257;, accompanied by the great sage Bh&#7771;gu and great personalities like Dak&#7779;a, went to see Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu. He then sprinkled water from his <span class="Italic">kama&#7751;&#7693;alu,</span> a type of waterpot, upon Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu&rsquo;s head.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, the King of the Daityas, bowed down before Lord Brahm&#257;, the creator of this universe, offering respectful obeisances again and again and offering prayers. When Lord Brahm&#257; agreed to give him benedictions, he prayed not be killed by any living entity, not to be killed in any place, covered or uncovered, not to die in the daytime or at night, not to be killed by any weapon, on land or in the air, and not to be killed by any human being, animal, demigod or any other entity, living or nonliving. He further prayed for supremacy over the entire universe and requested the eight yogic perfections, such as <span class="Italic">a&#7751;im&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">laghim&#257;.</span></div>

<div class="Translation">N&#257;rada Muni said to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira: The demoniac king Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu wanted to be unconquerable and free from old age and dwindling of the body. He wanted to gain all the yogic perfections like a&#7751;im&#257; and laghim&#257;, to be deathless, and to be the only king of the entire universe, including Brahmaloka.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Such are the goals of the austerities performed by demons. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu wanted to receive a benediction from Lord Brahm&#257; so that in the future he would be able to conquer Lord Brahm&#257;&rsquo;s abode. Similarly, another demon received a benediction from Lord &#346;iva but later wanted to kill Lord &#346;iva through that same benediction. Thus self-interested persons, by demoniac austerity, want to kill even their benedictors, whereas the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava wants to remain an ever-existing servant of the Lord and never to occupy the post of the Lord. Through <span class="Italic">s&#257;yujya-mukti,</span> which is generally demanded by <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> one merges into the existence of the Lord, but although one sometimes thus achieves the goal of the theory of monism, one falls down again to struggle in material existence.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the material world, a servant is provided for by the master but is always planning how to capture the master&rsquo;s post. There have been many instances of this in history. Especially in India during the Mohammedan rule, many servants, by plans and devices, took over the posts of their masters. It is learned from Caitanya literature that one big Zamindar, Subuddhi R&#257;ya, kept a Mohammedan boy as a servant. Of course, he treated the boy as his own child, and sometimes, when the boy would steal something, the master would chastise him by striking him with a cane. There was a mark on the boy&rsquo;s back from this chastisement. Later, after that boy had by crooked means become Hussain Shah, Nawab of Bengal, one day his wife saw the mark on his back and inquired about it. The Nawab replied that in his childhood he had been a servant of Subuddhi R&#257;ya, who had punished him because of some mischievous activities. Upon hearing this, the Nawab&rsquo;s wife immediately became agitated and requested her husband to kill Subuddhi R&#257;ya. Nawab Hussain Shah, of course, was very grateful to Subuddhi R&#257;ya and therefore refused to kill him, but when his wife requested him to turn Subuddhi R&#257;ya into a Mohammedan, the Nawab agreed. Taking some water from his waterpot, he sprinkled it upon Subuddhi R&#257;ya and declared that Subuddhi R&#257;ya had now become a Mohammedan. The point is that this Nawab had been an ordinary menial servant of Subuddhi R&#257;ya but was somehow or other able to occupy the supreme post of Nawab of Bengal. This is the material world. Everyone is trying to become master through various devices, although everyone is servant of his senses. Following this system, a living entity, although servant of his senses, tries to become master of the whole universe. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was a typical example of this, and Brahm&#257; was informed by the demigods of his intentions.</div>

<div class="Translation">O Lord Brahm&#257;, your position within this universe is certainly most auspicious for everyone, especially the cows and br&#257;hma&#7751;as. Brahminical culture and the protection of cows can be increasingly glorified, and thus all kinds of material happiness, opulence and good fortune will automatically increase. But unfortunately, if Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu occupies your seat, everything will be lost.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In this verse the words <span class="Italic">dvija-gav&#257;&#7745; p&#257;rame&#7779;&#7789;hyam</span> indicate the most exalted position of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> brahminical culture and the cows. In Vedic culture, the welfare of the cows and the welfare of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are essential. Without a proper arrangement for developing brahminical culture and protecting cows, all the affairs of administration will go to hell. Being afraid that Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu would occupy the post of Brahm&#257;, all the demigods were extremely disturbed. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was a well-known demon, and the demigods knew that if demons and R&#257;k&#7779;asas were to occupy the supreme post, brahminical culture and protection of cows would come to an end. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index2ceb.html?g=2055">5.29</a>), the original proprietor of everything is Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (<span class="Italic">bhokt&#257;ra&#7745; yaj&ntilde;a-tapas&#257;&#7745; sarva-loka-mahe&#347;varam</span>). The Lord, therefore, knows particularly well how to develop the material condition of the living entities within this material world. In every universe there is one Brahm&#257; engaged on behalf of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, as confirmed in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<span class="Italic">tene brahma h&#7771;daya &#257;di-kavaye</span>). The principal creator in each <span class="Italic">brahm&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</span> is Lord Brahm&#257;, who imparts Vedic knowledge to his disciples and sons. On every planet, the king or supreme controller must be a representative of Brahm&#257;. Therefore, if a R&#257;k&#7779;asa, or demon, were situated in Brahm&#257;&rsquo;s post, then the entire arrangement of the universe, especially the protection of the brahminical culture and cows, would be ruined. All the demigods anticipated this danger, and therefore they went to request Lord Brahm&#257; to take immediate steps to thwart Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu&rsquo;s plan.</div>
<div class="Purport">In the beginning of creation, Lord Brahm&#257; was attacked by two demons&mdash;Madhu and Kai&#7789;abha&mdash;but K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a saved him. Therefore K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is addressed as <span class="Italic">madhu-kai&#7789;abha-hant&#7771;.</span> Now again, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was trying to replace Brahm&#257;. The material world is so situated that even the position of Lord Brahm&#257;, not to speak of ordinary living entities, is sometimes in danger. Nonetheless, until the time of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, no one had tried to replace Lord Brahm&#257;. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, however, was such a great demon that he maintained this ambition.</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">bh&#363;tyai</span> means &ldquo;for increasing opulence,&rdquo; and the word <span class="Italic">&#347;reyase</span> refers to ultimately returning home, back to Godhead. In spiritual advancement, one&rsquo;s material position improves at the same time that the path of liberation becomes clear and one is freed from material bondage. If one is situated in an opulent position in spiritual advancement, his opulence never decreases. Therefore such a spiritual benediction is called <span class="Italic">bh&#363;ti</span> or <span class="Italic">vibh&#363;ti.</span> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a confirms this in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index8205.html?g=3654">10.41</a>). <span class="Italic">Yad yad vibh&#363;timat sattva&#7745;.</span> <span class="Italic">.. mama tejo-&rsquo;&#7745;&#347;a-sambhavam:</span> if a devotee advances in spiritual consciousness and thus becomes materially opulent also, his position is a special gift from the Lord. Such opulence is never to be considered material. At the present, especially on this planet earth, the influence of Lord Brahm&#257; has decreased considerably, and the representatives of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu&mdash;the R&#257;k&#7779;asas and demons&mdash;have taken charge. Therefore there is no protection of brahminical culture and cows, which are the basic prerequisites for all kinds of good fortune. This age is very dangerous because society is being managed by demons and R&#257;k&#7779;asas.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Lord Brahm&#257;, who is carried by a swan airplane, at first could not see where Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was, for Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu&rsquo;s body was covered by an anthill and by grass and bamboo sticks. Because Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu had been there for a long time, the ants had devoured his skin, fat, flesh and blood. Then Lord Brahm&#257; and the demigods spotted him, resembling a cloud-covered sun, heating all the world by his austerity. Struck with wonder, Lord Brahm&#257; began to smile and then addressed him as follows.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The living entity can live merely by his own power, without the help of skin, marrow, bone, blood and so on, because it is said, <span class="Italic">asa&#7749;go&rsquo;ya&#7745; puru&#7779;a&#7717;</span>&mdash;the living entity has nothing to do with the material covering. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu performed a severe type of <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> austerity, for many long years. Indeed, it is said that he performed the <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> for one hundred heavenly years. Since one day of the demigods equals six of our months, certainly this was a very long time. By nature&rsquo;s own way, his body had been almost consumed by earthworms, ants and other parasites, and therefore even Brahm&#257; was at first unable to see him. Later, however, Brahm&#257; could ascertain where Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was, and Brahm&#257; was struck with wonder to see Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu&rsquo;s extraordinary power to execute <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> Anyone would conclude that Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was dead because his body was covered in so many ways, but Lord Brahm&#257;, the supreme living being in this universe, could understand that Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was alive but covered by material elements.</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Purport">It is also to be noted that although Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu performed this austerity for a long, long time, he was nonetheless known as a Daitya and R&#257;k&#7779;asa. It will be seen from verses to follow that even great saintly persons could not perform such a severe type of austerity. Why then was he called a R&#257;k&#7779;asa and Daitya? It is because whatever he did was for his own sense gratification. His son Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was only five years old, and so what could Prahl&#257;da do? Yet simply by performing a little devotional service according to the instructions of N&#257;rada Muni, Prahl&#257;da became so dear to the Lord that the Lord came to save him, whereas Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, in spite of all his austerities, was killed. This is the difference between devotional service and all other methods of perfection. One who performs severe austerities for sense gratification is fearful to the entire world. whereas a devotee who performs even a slight amount of devotional service is a friend to everyone (<span class="Italic">suh&#7771;da&#7745; sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;n&#257;m</span>). Since the Lord is the well-wisher of every living entity and since a devotee assumes the qualities of the Lord, a devotee also acts for everyone&rsquo;s good fortune by performing devotional service. Thus although Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu performed such a severe austerity, he remained a Daitya and a R&#257;k&#7779;asa, whereas Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, although born of the same Daitya father, became the most exalted devotee and was personally protected by the Supreme Lord. <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> is therefore called <span class="Italic">sarvop&#257;dhi-vinirmuktam</span></I> [Cc.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexae45.html?g=3192">9.23</a>&ndash;24):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">ye &rsquo;py anya-devat&#257;-bhakt&#257;<br>yajante &#347;raddhay&#257;nvit&#257;&#7717;<br>te &rsquo;pi m&#257;m eva kaunteya<br>yajanty avidhi-p&#363;rvakam</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Whatever a man may sacrifice to other gods, O son of Kunt&#299;, is really meant for Me alone, but it is offered without true understanding. I am the only enjoyer and the only object of sacrifice. Those who do not recognize My true transcendental nature fall down.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">In effect, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says, &ldquo;Persons engaged in the worship of demigods are not very intelligent, although such worship is indirectly offered to Me.&rdquo; For example, when a man pours water on the leaves and branches of a tree without pouring water on the root, he does so without sufficient knowledge or without observing regulative principles. The process of watering a tree is to pour water on the root. Similarly, the process of rendering service to different parts of the body is to supply food to the stomach. The demigods are, so to speak, different officers and directors in the government of the Supreme Lord. One has to follow the laws made by the government, not by the officers or directors. Similarly, everyone is to offer his worship to the Supreme Lord only. That will automatically satisfy the different officers and directors of the Lord. The officers and directors are engaged as representatives of the government, and to offer some bribe to the officers and directors is illegal. This is stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as <span class="Italic">avidhi-p&#363;rvakam.</span> In other words, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a does not approve the unnecessary worship of the demigods.</div>
<div class="Purport">In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is clearly stated that there are many types of <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a</span> performances recommended in the Vedic literatures, but actually all of them are meant for satisfying the Supreme Lord. <span class="Italic">Yaj&ntilde;a</span> means Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. In the Third Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is clearly stated that one should work only for satisfying Yaj&ntilde;a, or Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. The perfectional form of human civilization, known as <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma,</span> is specifically meant for satisfying Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Therefore, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says, &ldquo;I am the enjoyer of all sacrifices because I am the supreme master.&rdquo; However, less intelligent persons, without knowing this fact, worship demigods for temporary benefit. Therefore they fall down to material existence and do not achieve the desired goal of life. If, however, anyone has any material desire to be fulfilled, he had better pray for it to the Supreme Lord (although that is not pure devotion), and he will thus achieve the desired result.</div>
<div class="Purport">Although Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu offered his obeisances unto Lord Brahm&#257;, he was strongly inimical toward Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. This is the symptom of an <span class="Italic">asura.</span> <span class="Italic">Asuras</span> worship the demigods as being separate from the Lord, not knowing that all the demigods are powerful because of being servants of the Lord. If the Supreme Lord were to withdraw the powers of the demigods, the demigods would no longer be able to offer benedictions to their worshipers. The difference between a devotee and a nondevotee, or <span class="Italic">asura,</span> is that a devotee knows that Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that everyone derives power from Him. Without worshiping the demigods for particular powers, a devotee worships Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, knowing that if he desires a particular power he can get that power while acting as Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&rsquo;s devotee. Therefore in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="indexa0d6.html?g=14064">2.3.10</a>) it is recommended:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">ak&#257;ma&#7717; sarva-k&#257;mo v&#257;<br>mok&#7779;a-k&#257;ma ud&#257;ra-dh&#299;&#7717;<br>t&#299;vre&#7751;a bhakti-yogena<br>yajeta puru&#7779;a&#7745; param</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;A person who has broader intelligence, whether he be full of material desires, free from material desires, or desiring liberation, must by all means worship the supreme whole, the Personality of Godhead.&rdquo; Even if a person has material desires, instead of worshiping the demigods he should pray to the Supreme Lord so that his connection with the Supreme Lord will be established and he will be saved from becoming a demon or a nondevotee. In this regard, &#346;r&#299;la Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya gives the following quotation from the <span class="Italic">Brahma-tarka:</span></div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">eka-sth&#257;naika-k&#257;ryatv&#257;d<br>vi&#7779;&#7751;o&#7717; pr&#257;dh&#257;nyatas tath&#257;<br>j&#299;vasya tad-adh&#299;natv&#257;n<br>na bhinn&#257;dhik&#7771;ta&#7745; vaca&#7717;</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Since Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is the Supreme, by worshiping Vi&#7779;&#7751;u one can fulfill all one&rsquo;s desires. There is no need to divert one&rsquo;s attention to any demigod.</div>

Brahm&#257; receives his mind, intelligence, materials and everything else from K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and then he becomes the secondary creator, the engineer of this universe. In this regard we may note that the creation does not take place accidentally, because of the explosion of a chunk. Such nonsensical theories are not accepted by Vedic students. The first created living being is Brahm&#257;, who is endowed with perfect knowledge and intelligence by the Lord. As stated in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, tene brahma h&#7771;d&#257; ya &#257;di-kavaye:</span> although Brahm&#257; is the first created being, he is not independent, for he receives help from the Supreme Personality of Godhead through his heart. There is no one but Brahm&#257; at the time of creation, and therefore he receives his intelligence directly from the Lord through the heart. This has been discussed in the beginning of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">Lord Brahm&#257; is described in this verse as the original cause of the cosmic manifestation, and this applies to his position in the material world. There are many, many such controllers, all of whom are created by the Supreme Lord, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. This is illustrated by an incident described in <span class="Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta.</span> When the Brahm&#257; of this particular universe was invited by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a to Dv&#257;rak&#257;, he thought that he was the only Brahm&#257;. Therefore when K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a inquired from His servant which Brahm&#257; was at the door to visit, Lord Brahm&#257; was surprised. He replied that of course Lord Brahm&#257;, the father of the four Kum&#257;ras, was waiting at the door. Later, Lord Brahm&#257; asked K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a why He had inquired which Brahm&#257; had come. He was then informed that there are millions of other Brahm&#257;s because there are millions of universes. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a then called all the Brahm&#257;s, who immediately came to visit Him. The <span class="Italic">catur-mukha</span> Brahm&#257;, the four-headed Brahm&#257; of this universe, thought himself a very insignificant creature in the presence of so many Brahm&#257;s with so many heads. Thus although there is a Brahm&#257; who is the engineer of each universe, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the original source of all of them.</div>

The external potency manifests this material world, the internal potency manifests the spiritual world, and the marginal potency manifests the living entities, who are mixtures of internal and external. The living entity, being part and parcel of Parabrahman, is actually internal potency, but because of being in contact with the material energy, he is an emanation of material and spiritual energies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is above the material energy and is engaged in spiritual pastimes. The material energy is only an external manifestation of His pastimes.</div>

His first proposal is that he not be killed by any of the different forms of living entities created by Lord Brahm&#257; within this material world.</div>

<div class="First">Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was very much afraid of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&rsquo;s becoming an animal to kill him because his brother had been killed by Vi&#7779;&#7751;u when the Lord took the shape of a boar. He was therefore very careful to guard against all kinds of animals. But even without taking the shape of an animal, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u could kill him by hurling His Sudar&#347;ana <span class="Italic">cakra,</span> which can go anywhere without the Lord&rsquo;s physical presence. Therefore Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was careful to guard against all kinds of weapons. He guarded against all kinds of time, space and countries because he was afraid of being killed by someone else in another land. There are many other planets, higher and lower, and therefore he prayed for the benediction of not being killed by any resident of any of these planets. There are three original deities&mdash;Brahm&#257;, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and Mahe&#347;vara. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu knew that Brahm&#257; would not kill him, but he also wanted not to be killed by Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u or Lord &#346;iva. Consequently, he prayed for such a benediction. Thus Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu thought himself securely protected from any kind of death caused by any living entity within this universe. He also carefully guarded against natural death, which might take place within his house or outside of the house.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This chapter fully describes how Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu obtained power from Lord Brahm&#257; and misused it by harassing all the living entities within this universe.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">By severe austerities, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu satisfied Lord Brahm&#257; and obtained the benedictions he desired. After he received these benedictions, his body, which had been almost entirely consumed, was revived with full beauty and a luster like gold. Nonetheless, he continued to be envious of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, unable to forget Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&rsquo;s having killed his brother. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu conquered everyone in the ten directions and the three worlds and brought all living entities, both demigods and <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> under his control. Becoming the master of all places, including the residence of Indra, whom he had driven out, he began enjoying life in great luxury and thus became mad. All the demigods but Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord &#346;iva came under his control and began serving him, but despite all his material power he was dissatisfied because he was always puffed up, proud of transgressing the Vedic regulations. All the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> were dissatisfied with him, and they cursed him with determination. Eventually, all the living entities within the universe, represented by the demigods and sages, prayed to the Supreme Lord for relief from Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu&rsquo;s rule.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u informed the demigods that they and the other living entities would be saved from the fearful conditions created by Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu. Since Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was the oppressor of all the demigods, the followers of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> the cows, the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and the religious, saintly persons, and since he was envious of the Supreme Lord, he would naturally be killed very soon. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu&rsquo;s last exploit would be to torment his own son Prahl&#257;da, who was a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata,</span> an exalted Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. Then his life would end. When the demigods were thus reassured by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everyone was satisfied, knowing that the miseries inflicted upon them by Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu would come to an end.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Finally, N&#257;rada Muni describes the characteristics of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, the son of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, and describes how his father envied his own qualified son. In this way the chapter ends.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The word <span class="Italic">garu&#7693;a</span> in this verse indicates that there are planets of great birds like Garu&#7693;a. Similarly, the word <span class="Italic">uraga</span> indicates that there are planets of enormous serpents. Such a description of the various planets of the universe may challenge modern scientists who think that all planets but this earth are vacant. These scientists claim to have launched excursions to the moon, where they have found no living entities but only big craters full of dust and stone, although in fact the moon is so brilliant that it acts like the sun in illuminating the entire universe. Of course, it is not possible to convince modern scientists of the Vedic information about the universe. Nonetheless, we are not very much impressed by the words of scientists who say that all other planets are vacant and that only the earth is full of living entities.</div>

<div class="First">From this description it appears that all the heavenly planets of the upper planetary system are thousands upon thousands of times more opulent than the lower planetary system in which we live. Vi&#347;vakarm&#257;, the famous heavenly architect, is known as the constructor of many wonderful buildings in the upper planets, where there are not only beautiful buildings, but also many opulent gardens and parks, which are described as <span class="Italic">nandana-devody&#257;na,</span> gardens quite fit to be enjoyed by the demigods. This description of the upper planetary system and its opulences is to be understood from authoritative scriptures like the Vedic literatures. Telescopes and the other imperfect instruments of scientists are inadequate for evaluating the upper planetary system. Although such instruments are needed because the vision of the so-called scientists is imperfect, the instruments themselves are also imperfect. Therefore the upper planets cannot be appraised by imperfect men using imperfect man-made instruments. Direct information received from the Vedic literature, however, is perfect, We therefore cannot accept the statement that there are no opulent residences on planets other than this earth.</div>

<div class="Translation">The steps of King Indra&rsquo;s residence were made of coral, the floor was bedecked with invaluable emeralds, the walls were of crystal, and the columns of vaid&#363;rya stone. The wonderful canopies were beautifully decorated, the seats were bedecked with rubies, and the silk bedding, as white as foam, was decorated with pearls. The ladies of the palace, who were blessed with beautiful teeth and the most wonderfully beautiful faces, walked here and there in the palace, their ankle bells tinkling melodiously, and saw their own beautiful reflections in the gems. The demigods, however, being very much oppressed, had to bow down and offer obeisances at the feet of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, who chastised the demigods very severely and for no reason. Thus Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu lived in the palace and severely ruled everyone.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was so powerful in the heavenly planets that all the demigods except Lord Brahm&#257;, Lord &#346;iva and Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u were forced to engage in his service. Indeed, they were afraid of being severely punished if they disobeyed him. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; has compared Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Vena, who was also atheistic and scornful of the ritualistic ceremonies mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> Yet Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Vena was afraid of some of the great sages such as Bh&#7771;gu, whereas Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu ruled in such a way that everyone feared him but Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord &#346;iva. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was so alert against being burnt to ashes by the anger of great sages like Bh&#7771;gu that by dint of austerity he surpassed their power and placed even them under his subordination. It appears that even in the higher planetary systems, to which people are promoted by pious activities, disturbances are created by <span class="Italic">asuras</span> like Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu.

<div class="First">The water of the seas and oceans of this planet, of which we have experience, are salty, but other planets within the universe contain oceans of sugarcane juice, liquor, ghee, milk and sweet water. The rivers are figuratively described as wives of the oceans and seas because they glide down to the oceans and seas as tributaries, like the wives attached to their husbands. Modern scientists attempt excursions to other planets, but they have no information of how many different types of oceans and seas there are within the universe. According to their experience, the moon is full of dust, but this does not explain how it gives us soothing rays from a distance of millions of miles. As far as we are concerned, we follow the authority of Vy&#257;sadeva and &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, who have described the universal situation according to the Vedic literature. These authorities differ from modern scientists who conclude from their imperfect sensual experience that only this planet is inhabited by living beings whereas the other planets are all vacant or full of dust.</div>

Indeed, all of these are ways of seeing Him, for everything done in devotional service is a means of direct contact with the Lord. The vibration of the Lord&rsquo;s voice appeared in the presence of all the devotees, and although the person vibrating the sound was unseen to them, they were meeting or seeing the Lord because they were offering prayers and because the vibration of the Lord was present. Contrary to the laws of the material world, there is no difference between seeing the Lord, offering prayers and hearing the transcendental vibration. Pure devotees, therefore, are fully satisfied by glorifying the Lord. Such glorification is called <span class="Italic">k&#299;rtana.</span> Performing <span class="Italic">k&#299;rtana</span> and hearing the vibration of the sound Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is actually seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Of all sinful activities, an offense to a pure devotee, or Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, is the most severe. An offense at the lotus feet of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is so disastrous that &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu has compared it to a mad elephant that enters a garden and causes great havoc by uprooting many plants and trees. If one is an offender at the lotus feet of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> or Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, his offenses uproot all his auspicious activities. One should therefore very carefully guard against committing <span class="Italic">vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-apar&#257;dha,</span> or offenses at the lotus feet of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. Here the Lord clearly says that although Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu had received benedictions from Lord Brahm&#257;, these benedictions would be null and void as soon as he committed an offense at the lotus feet of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, his own son. A Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava like Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja is described herein as <span class="Italic">nirvaira,</span> having no enemies. Elsewhere in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="index1916.html?g=25981">3.25.21</a>) it is said, <span class="Italic">aj&#257;ta-&#347;atrava&#7717; &#347;&#257;nt&#257;&#7717; s&#257;dhava&#7717; s&#257;dhu-bh&#363;&#7779;a&#7751;&#257;&#7717;:</span> a devotee has no enemies, he is peaceful, he abides by the scriptures, and all his characteristics are sublime. A devotee does not create enmity with anyone, but if someone becomes his enemy, that person will be vanquished by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, despite whatever benedictions he may have received from other sources. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was certainly enjoying the fruitful results of his austerities, but here the Lord says that as soon as he committed an offense at the lotus feet of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja he would be ruined. One&rsquo;s longevity, opulence, beauty, education and whatever else one may possess as a result of pious activities cannot protect one if one commits an offense at the lotus feet of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. Despite whatever one possesses, if one offends the lotus feet of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava he will be vanquished.</div>

<div class="Translation">Who could list the innumerable transcendental qualities of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja? He had unflinching faith in V&#257;sudeva, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a [the son of Vasudeva], and unalloyed devotion to Him.

Therefore when this verse says <span class="Italic">v&#257;sudeve bhagavati,</span> one should understand that Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s attachment for N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva was attachment for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, V&#257;sudeva, the son of Vasudeva. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, therefore, is described as a great <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;.</span> As the Lord Himself confirms in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index4112.html?g=2631">7.19</a>):</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">From the very beginning of his childhood, Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was uninterested in childish playthings. Indeed, he gave them up altogether and remained silent and dull, being fully absorbed in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. Since his mind was always affected by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, he could not understand how the world goes on being fully absorbed in the activities of sense gratification.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja is the vivid example of a great person fully absorbed in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness.

As confirmed in the <span class="Ref_Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> (5.38):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">prem&#257;&ntilde;jana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena<br>santa&#7717; sadaiva h&#7771;daye&#7779;u vilokayanti<br>ya&#7745; &#347;y&#257;masundaram acintya-gu&#7751;a-svar&#363;pa&#7745;<br>govindam &#257;di-puru&#7779;a&#7745; tam aha&#7745; bhaj&#257;mi</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;I worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, who is always seen by the devotee whose eyes are anointed with the pulp of love. He is seen in His eternal form of &#346;y&#257;masundara, situated within the heart of the devotee.&rdquo; An exalted devotee, or <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;,</span> who is rarely to be seen, remains fully conscious of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and constantly sees the Lord within the core of his heart. It is sometimes said that when one is influenced by evil stars like Saturn, R&#257;hu or Ketu, he cannot make advancement in any prospective activity. In just the opposite way, Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was influenced by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the supreme planet, and thus he could not think of the material world and live without K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. That is the sign of a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata.</span> Even if one is an enemy of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata</span> sees him to be also engaged in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s service. Another crude example is that everything appears yellow to the jaundiced eye. Similarly, to a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata,</span> everyone but himself appears to be engaged in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s service.</div>
<div class="Purport">Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja is the approved <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata,</span> the supreme devotee. In the previous verse it was stated that he had natural attachment (<span class="Italic">naisargik&#299; rati&#7717;</span>). The symptoms of such natural attachment for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a are described in this verse. Although Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was only a boy, he had no interest in playing. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (11.2.42), <span class="Italic">viraktir anyatra ca:</span> the symptom of perfect K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness is that one loses interest in all material activities. For a small boy to give up playing is impossible, but Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, being situated in first-class devotional service, was always absorbed in a trance of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. Just as a materialistic person is always absorbed in thoughts of material gain, a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata</span> like Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja is always absorbed in thoughts of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">A small child, while being cared for by his mother, does not know how the needs of the body for eating, sleeping, lying down, passing water and evacuating are being fulfilled.

The necessary activities of his body were performed without his knowledge. As a father and mother care for their child, Govinda cared for Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, who remained always absorbed in thoughts of Govinda. This is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness.

<div class="Translation">Sometimes, upon seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja would loudly call in full anxiety. He sometimes lost his shyness in jubilation and began dancing in ecstasy, and sometimes, being fully absorbed in thoughts of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, he felt oneness and imitated the pastimes of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja sometimes felt that the Lord was far away from him and therefore called Him loudly. When he saw that the Lord was before him, he was fully jubilant. Sometimes, thinking himself one with the Supreme, he imitated the Lord&rsquo;s pastimes, and in separation from the Lord he would sometimes show symptoms of madness. These feelings of a devotee would not be appreciated by impersonalists. One must go further and further into spiritual understanding. The first realization is impersonal Brahman, but one must go still further to realize Param&#257;tm&#257; and eventually the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is worshiped by the transcendental feelings of a devotee in a relationship of <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;nta, d&#257;sya, sakhya, v&#257;tsalya</span> or <span class="Italic">m&#257;dhurya.</span> Here the feelings of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja were in the mellow of <span class="Italic">v&#257;tsalya,</span> filial love and affection. As a child cries when left by his mother, when Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja felt that the Lord was away from him he began to cry (<span class="Italic">nadati</span>). Again, a devotee like Prahl&#257;da sometimes sees that the Lord is coming from a long distance to pacify him, like a mother responding to a child, saying, &ldquo;My dear child, do not cry. I am coming.&rdquo; Then the devotee, without being ashamed due to his surroundings and circumstances, begins to dance, thinking, &ldquo;Here is my Lord! My Lord is coming!&rdquo; Thus the devotee, in full ecstasy, sometimes imitates the pastimes of the Lord, just as the cowherd boys used to imitate the behavior of the jungle animals. However, he does not actually become the Lord. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja achieved the spiritual ecstasies described herein by his advancement in spiritual understanding.</div>

<div class="First">Apparently Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was placed in circumstances in which he was always tortured by his father. In such material conditions, one cannot have an undisturbed mind, but since <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is unconditional (<span class="Italic">ahaituky apratihat&#257;</span>), Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was never disturbed by the chastisements of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu. On the contrary, the bodily symptoms of his ecstatic love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead turned the minds of his friends, who had also been born in atheistic families. Instead of being disturbed by the torments of his father, Prahl&#257;da influenced these friends and cleansed their minds. A devotee is never contaminated by material conditions, but persons subjected to material conditions can become spiritually advanced and blissful upon seeing the behavior of a pure devotee.</div>

I wish to know about this subject from you.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">To know about the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the characteristics of His pure devotee, one must inquire from authorities like Devar&#7779;i N&#257;rada. One cannot inquire about transcendental subject matters from a layman. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="indexf0bf-2.html?g=26017">3.25.25</a>), <span class="Italic">sat&#257;&#7745; prasa&#7749;g&#257;n mama v&#299;rya-sa&#7745;vido bhavanti h&#7771;t-kar&#7751;a-ras&#257;yan&#257;&#7717; kath&#257;&#7717;:</span> only by association with devotees can one authoritatively understand the position of the Lord and His devotees. A devotee like N&#257;rada Muni is addressed as <span class="Italic">suvrata.</span> <span class="Italic">Su</span> means &ldquo;good,&rdquo; and <span class="Italic">vrata</span> means &ldquo;vow.&rdquo; Thus the word <span class="Italic">suvrata</span> refers to a person who has nothing to do with the material world, which is always bad. One cannot understand anything spiritual from a materialistic scholar puffed up with academic knowledge. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexbf7d.html?g=5898">18.55</a>), <span class="Italic">bhakty&#257; m&#257;m abhij&#257;n&#257;ti:</span> one must try to understand K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a by devotional service and from a devotee.

As described in this chapter, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu tried to kill Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, even by having a snake bite him and by putting him under the feet of elephants, yet he was unsuccessful.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu&rsquo;s spiritual master, &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya, had two sons named &#7778;a&#7751;&#7693;a and Amarka, to whom Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was entrusted for education. Although the teachers tried to educate the boy Prahl&#257;da in politics, economics and other material activities, he did not care for their instructions. Instead, he continued to be a pure devotee. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja never liked the idea of discriminating between one&rsquo;s friends and enemies. Because he was spiritually inclined, he was equal toward everyone.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Once upon a time, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu inquired from his son what the best thing was that he had learned from his teachers. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja replied that a man engrossed in the material consciousness of duality, thinking, &ldquo;This is mine, and that belongs to my enemy,&rdquo; should give up his householder life and go to the forest to worship the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">When Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu heard from his son about devotional service, he decided that this small boy had been polluted by some friend in school. Thus he advised the teachers to take care of the boy so that he would not become a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious devotee. However, when the teachers inquired from Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja why he was going against their teachings, Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja taught the teachers that the mentality of ownership is false and that he was therefore trying to become an unalloyed devotee of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. The teachers, being very angry at this answer, chastised and threatened the boy with many fearful conditions. They taught him to the best of their ability and then brought him before his father.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu affectionately took his son Prahl&#257;da on his lap and then inquired from him what the best thing was that he had learned from his teachers. As usual, Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja began praising the nine processes of devotional service, such as <span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;am</span> and <span class="Italic">k&#299;rtanam.</span> Thus the King of the demons, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, being extremely angry, chastised the teachers, &#7778;a&#7751;&#7693;a and Amarka, for having wrongly trained Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. The so-called teachers informed the King that Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was automatically a devotee and did not listen to their instructions. When they proved themselves innocent, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu inquired from Prahl&#257;da where he had learned <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-bhakti.</span> Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja replied that those who are attached to family life do not develop K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, either personally or collectively. Instead, they suffer repeated birth and death in this material world and continue simply chewing the chewed. Prahl&#257;da explained that the duty of every man is to take shelter of a pure devotee and thus become eligible to understand K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Enraged at this answer, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu threw Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja from his lap. Since Prahl&#257;da was so treacherous that he had become a devotee of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, who had killed his uncle Hira&#7751;y&#257;k&#7779;a, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu asked his assistants to kill him. The assistants of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu struck Prahl&#257;da with sharp weapons, threw him under the feet of elephants, subjected him to hellish conditions, threw him from the peak of a mountain and tried to kill him in thousands of other ways, but they were unsuccessful. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu therefore became increasingly afraid of his son Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and arrested him. The sons of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu&rsquo;s spiritual master, &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya, began teaching Prahl&#257;da in their own way, but Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja did not accept their instructions. While the teachers were absent from the classroom, Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja began to preach K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness in the school, and by his instructions all his class friends, the sons of the demons, became devotees like him.</div>

<div class="Translation">Prahl&#257;da certainly heard and recited the topics of politics and economics taught by the teachers, but he understood that political philosophy involves considering someone a friend and someone else an enemy, and thus he did not like it.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Politics involves accepting one group of men as enemies and another group as friends. Everything in politics is based on this philosophy, and the entire world, especially at the present, is engrossed in it. The public is concerned with friendly countries and friendly groups or enemy countries and enemy groups, but as stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> a learned person does not make distinctions between enemies and friends. Devotees, especially, do not create friends and enemies. A devotee sees that every living being is part and parcel of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (<span class="Italic">mamaiv&#257;&#7745;&#347;o j&#299;va-bh&#363;ta&#7717;</span><I> </I>[15.7]). Therefore a devotee treats friends and enemies equally by trying to educate them both in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. Of course, atheistic men do not follow the instructions of pure devotees, but instead consider a devotee their enemy. A devotee, however, never creates a situation of friendship and enmity. Although Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was obliged to hear the instructions of &#7778;a&#7751;&#7693;a and Amarka, he did not like the philosophy of friends and enemies, which forms the basis of politics. He was not interested in this philosophy.</div>

It is impossible, practically speaking, for ordinary men to challenge scientists or philosophers concerning genuine knowledge, but a devotee can challenge them because the best of everything is known to a devotee by the grace of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.

The Vedic injunction is <span class="Italic">asato m&#257; jyotir gama:</span> everyone should give up the platform of temporary existence and approach the eternal platform. The soul is eternal, and topics concerning the eternal soul are actually knowledge. Elsewhere it is said, <span class="Italic">apa&#347;yat&#257;m &#257;tma-tattva&#7745; g&#7771;he&#7779;u g&#7771;ha-medhin&#257;m:</I> [SB </span></I><a href="index825e.html?g=13330">2.1.2</a>] those who are attached to the bodily conception of life and who thus stick to life as a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha,</span> or householder, on the platform of material sense enjoyment, cannot see the welfare of the eternal soul. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja confirmed this by saying that if one wants success in life, he should immediately understand from the right sources what his self-interest is and how he should mold his life in spiritual consciousness. One should understand himself to be part and parcel of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and thus completely take shelter of His lotus feet for guaranteed spiritual success. Everyone in the material world is in the bodily conception, struggling hard for existence, life after life. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja therefore recommended that to stop this material condition of repeated birth and death, one should go to the forest (<span class="Italic">vana</span>).</div>

<div class="First">In our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, the tactic of dressing oneself like an ordinary <span class="Italic">karm&#299;</span> is necessary because everyone in the demoniac kingdom is against the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava teachings. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness is not at all to the liking of the demons of the present age. As soon as they see a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava dressed in saffron garments with beads on his neck and <span class="Italic">tilaka</span> on his forehead, they are immediately irritated. They criticize the Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas by sarcastically saying Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and some people also chant Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a sincerely. In either case, since Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is absolute, whether one chants it jokingly or sincerely, it will have its effect. The Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas are pleased when the demons chant Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a because this shows that the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a movement is taking ground. The greater demons, like Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, are always prepared to chastise the Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas, and they try to make arrangements so that Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas will not come to sell their books and preach K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. Thus what was done by Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu long, long ago is still being done. That is the way of materialistic life. Demons or materialists do not at all like the advancement of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, and they try to hinder it in many ways. Yet the preachers of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness must go forward&mdash;in their Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava dress or any other dress&mdash;for the purpose of preaching. C&#257;&#7751;akya Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita says that if an honest person deals with a great cheater, it is necessary for him to become a cheater also, not for the purpose of cheating but to make his preaching successful.</div>

Oneness is possible through this understanding, not through artificially thinking that every one of us is God or equal to God. The true understanding is that God is the supreme master and that all of us are servants of the Supreme Lord and are therefore on the same platform. This had already been taught to Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja by his spiritual master, N&#257;rada, but Prahl&#257;da was nonetheless surprised by how a bewildered soul thinks one person his enemy and another his friend.</div>

According to the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava philosophy, the master is one, and the servants are also one, but the distinction between the master and servant must continue even in the liberated stage. In the conditioned stage we think that some living beings are our friends whereas others are enemies, and thus we are in duality. In the liberated stage, however, the conception is that God is the master and that all living entities, being servants of God, are one.</div>

<div class="Translation">When the Supreme Personality of Godhead is pleased with the living entity because of his devotional service, one becomes a pa&#7751;&#7693;ita and does not make distinctions between enemies, friends and himself. Intelligently, he then thinks, &ldquo;Every one of us is an eternal servant of God, and therefore we are not different from one another.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">When Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s teachers and demoniac father asked him how his intelligence had been polluted, Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja said, &ldquo;As far as I am concerned, my intelligence has not been polluted. Rather, by the grace of my spiritual master and by the grace of my Lord, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, I have now learned that no one is my enemy and no one is my friend. We are all actually eternal servants of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, but under the influence of the external energy we think that we are separately situated from the Supreme Personality of Godhead as friends and enemies of one another. This mistaken idea has now been corrected, and therefore, unlike ordinary human beings, I no longer think that I am God and that others are my friends and enemies. Now I am rightly thinking that everyone is an eternal servant of God and that our duty is to serve the supreme master, for then we shall stand on the platform of oneness as servants.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">Demons think of everyone as a friend or enemy, but Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas say that since everyone is a servant of the Lord, everyone is on the same platform. Therefore a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava treats other living entities neither as friends nor as enemies, but instead tries to spread K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, teaching everyone that we are all one as servants of the Supreme Lord but are uselessly wasting our valuable lives by creating nations, communities and other groups of friends and enemies. Everyone should come to the platform of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness and thus feel oneness as a servant of the Lord. Although there are 8,400,000 species of life, a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava feels this oneness. The <span class="Italic">&#298;&#347;opani&#7779;ad</span> advises, <span class="Italic">ekatvam anupa&#347;yata&#7717;.</span> A devotee should see the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be situated in everyone&rsquo;s heart and should also see every living entity as an eternal servant of the Lord. This vision is called <span class="Italic">ekatvam,</span> oneness. Although there is a relationship of master and servant, both master and servant are one because of their spiritual identity. This is also <span class="Italic">ekatvam.</span> Thus the conception of <span class="Italic">ekatvam</span> for the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is different from that of the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;.</div>
<div class="Purport">Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu asked Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja how he had become antagonistic to his family. When a family member is killed by an enemy, all the members of the family would naturally be inimical to the murderer, but Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu saw that Prahl&#257;da had become friendly with the murderer. Therefore he asked, &ldquo;Who has created this kind of intelligence in you? Have you developed this consciousness by yourself? Since you are a small boy, someone must have induced you to think this way.&rdquo; Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja wanted to reply that an attitude favorable toward Vi&#7779;&#7751;u can develop only when the Lord is favorable (<span class="Italic">sa yad&#257;nuvrata&#7717;</span>). As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the friend of everyone (<span class="Italic">suh&#7771;da&#7745; sama-bh&#363;t&#257;n&#257;&#7745; j&ntilde;&#257;tv&#257; m&#257;&#7745; &#347;&#257;ntim &#7771;cchati</span>). The Lord is never an enemy to any of the millions of living entities, but is always a friend to everyone. This is true understanding. If one thinks that the Lord is an enemy, his intelligence is <span class="Italic">pa&#347;u-buddhi,</span> the intelligence of an animal. He falsely thinks, &ldquo;I am different from my enemy, and my enemy is different from me. The enemy has done this, and therefore my duty is to kill him.&rdquo; This misconception is described in this verse as <span class="Italic">bheda-gat&#257;sat&#299;.</span> The actual fact is that everyone is a servant of the Lord, as confirmed in <span class="Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta</span> by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu (<span class="Italic">j&#299;vera &lsquo;svar&#363;pa&rsquo; haya&mdash;k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;era &lsquo;nitya-d&#257;sa</span>&rsquo;<span class="Italic"> </I>[</span></I>Cc. <span class="Ref_Italic">Madhya</span> <a href="indexf61a.html?g=125576">20.108</a>]). As servants of the Lord, we are one, and there can be no questions of enmity or friendship. If one actually understands that every one of us is a servant of the Lord, where is the question of enemy or friend?</div>
<div class="Purport">Everyone should be friendly for the service of the Lord. Everyone should praise another&rsquo;s service to the Lord and not be proud of his own service. This is the way of Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava thinking, Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha thinking. There may be rivalries and apparent competition between servants in performing service, but in the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets the service of another servant is appreciated, not condemned. This is Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha competition. There is no question of enmity between servants. Everyone should be allowed to render service to the Lord to the best of his ability, and everyone should appreciate the service of others. Such are the activities of Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha. Since everyone is a servant, everyone is on the same platform and is allowed to serve the Lord according to his ability. As confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a>), <span class="Italic">sarvasya c&#257;ha&#7745; h&#7771;di sannivi&#7779;&#7789;o matta&#7717; sm&#7771;tir j&ntilde;&#257;nam apohana&#7745; ca:</span> the Lord is situated in everyone&rsquo;s heart, giving dictation according to the attitude of the servant. However, the Lord gives different dictation to the nondevotees and devotees. The nondevotees challenge the authority of the Supreme Lord, and therefore the Lord dictates in such a way that the nondevotees forget the Lord&rsquo;s service, life after life, and are punished by the laws of nature. But when a devotee very sincerely wants to render service to the Lord, the Lord dictates in a different way. As the Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index0c2e.html?g=3378">10.10</a>):</div>

<div class="Translation">O br&#257;hma&#7751;as [teachers], as iron attracted by a magnetic stone moves automatically toward the magnet, my consciousness, having been changed by His will, is attracted by Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, who carries a disc in His hand. Thus I have no independence.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">For iron to be attracted by a magnet is natural. Similarly, for all living entities to be attracted toward K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is natural, and therefore the Lord&rsquo;s real name is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, meaning He who attracts everyone and everything. The typical examples of such attraction are found in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, where everything and everyone is attracted by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The elderly persons like Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and Ya&#347;od&#257;dev&#299;, the friends like &#346;r&#299;d&#257;m&#257;, Sud&#257;m&#257; and the other cowherd boys, the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> like &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;&#7751;&#299; and Her associates, and even the birds, beasts, cows and calves are attracted. The flowers and fruits in the gardens are attracted, the waves of the Yamun&#257; are attracted, and the land, sky, trees, plants, animals and all other living beings are attracted by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. This is the natural situation of everything in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana.</div>
<div class="Purport">Just contrary to the affairs of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana is the material world, where no one is attracted by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and everyone is attracted by <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> This is the difference between the spiritual and material worlds. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, who was in the material world, was attracted by women and money, whereas Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, being in his natural position, was attracted by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. In replying to Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu&rsquo;s question about why Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja had a deviant view, Prahl&#257;da said that his view was not deviant, for the natural position of everyone is to be attracted by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu found this view deviant, Prahl&#257;da said, because of being unnaturally unattracted by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu therefore needed purification.</div>
<div class="Purport">As soon as one is purified of material contamination, he is again attracted by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (<span class="Italic">sarvop&#257;dhi-vinirmukta&#7745; tat-paratvena nirmalam</span></I> [Cc. Madhya </I><a href="index663c.html?g=124289">19.170</a></I>]</I>). In the material world, everyone is contaminated by the dirt of sense gratification and is acting according to different designations, sometimes as a human being, sometimes a beast, sometimes a demigod or tree, and so on. One must be cleansed of all these designations. Then one will be naturally attracted to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> process purifies the living entity of all unnatural attractions. When one is purified he is attracted by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and begins to serve K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a instead of serving <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> This is his natural position. A devotee is attracted by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, whereas a nondevotee, being contaminated by the dirt of material enjoyment, is not. This is confirmed by the Lord in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index49d1.html?g=2712">7.28</a>):</div>

<div class="Translation">Oh, please bring me a stick! This Prahl&#257;da is damaging our name and fame. Because of his bad intelligence, he has become like a cinder in the dynasty of the demons. Now he needs to be treated by the fourth of the four kinds of political diplomacy.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In political affairs, when a person disobediently agitates against the government, four principles are used to suppress him&mdash;legal orders, pacification, the offer of a post, or, finally, weapons. When there are no other arguments, he is punished. In logic, this is called <span class="Italic">argumentum ad baculum.</span> When the two seminal <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> &#7778;a&#7751;&#7693;a and Amarka failed to extract from Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja the cause for his having opinions different from those of his father, they called for a stick with which to chastise him to satisfy their master, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu. Because Prahl&#257;da had become a devotee, they considered him to be contaminated by bad intelligence and to be the worst descendant in the family of demons. As it is said, where ignorance is bliss, it is folly to be wise. In a society or family in which everyone is a demon, for someone to become a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is certainly folly. Thus Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was charged with bad intelligence because he was among demons, including his teachers, who were supposedly <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">The members of our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement are in a position similar to that of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. All over the world, ninety-nine percent of the people are godless demons, and therefore our preaching of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, following in the footsteps of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, is always hampered by many impediments. Because of their fault of being devotees, the American boys who have sacrificed everything for preaching K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness are charged with being members of the CIA. Moreover, the seminal <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> in India, who say that one can become a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> only if born in a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> family, charge us with ruining the Hindu system of religion. Of course, the fact is that one becomes a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> by qualification. Because we are training Europeans and Americans to become qualified and are awarding them brahminical status, we are being charged with destroying the Hindu religion. Nonetheless, confronting all kinds of difficulties, we must spread the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement with great determination, like that of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. In spite of being the son of the demon Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, Prahl&#257;da never feared the chastisements of the seminal <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> sons of a demoniac father.</div>

This is the way they educated him.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In this verse the words <span class="Italic">prahr&#257;da&#7745; gr&#257;hay&#257;m &#257;sa</span> are important. The words <span class="Italic">gr&#257;hay&#257;m &#257;sa</span> literally mean that they tried to induce Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja to accept the paths of <span class="Italic">dharma, artha</span> and <span class="Italic">k&#257;ma</span> (religion, economic development and sense gratification). People are generally preoccupied with these three concerns, without interest in the path of liberation. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, the father of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, was simply interested in gold and sense enjoyment. The word <span class="Italic">hira&#7751;ya</span> means &ldquo;gold,&rdquo; and <span class="Italic">ka&#347;ipu</span> refers to soft cushions and bedding on which people enjoy sense gratification. The word <span class="Italic">prahl&#257;da,</span> however, refers to one who is always joyful in understanding Brahman (<span class="Italic">brahma-bh&#363;ta&#7717; prasann&#257;tm&#257;</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexc2a1.html?g=5889">18.54</a>]). <span class="Italic">Prahl&#257;da</span> means <span class="Italic">prasann&#257;tm&#257;,</span> always joyful. Prahl&#257;da was always joyful in worshiping the Lord, but in accordance with the instructions of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, the teachers were interested in teaching him about material things. Materialistic persons think that the path of religion is meant for improving their material conditions. The materialist goes to a temple to worship many varieties of demigods just to receive some benediction to improve his material life. He goes to a <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhu</span> or so-called <span class="Italic">sv&#257;m&#299;</span> to take advantage of an easy method for achieving material opulence. In the name of religion, the so-called <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhus</span> try to satisfy the senses of the materialists by showing them shortcuts to material opulence. Sometimes they give some talisman or blessing. Sometimes they attract materialistic persons by producing gold. Then they declare themselves God, and foolish materialists are attracted to them for economic development. As a result of this process of cheating, others are reluctant to accept a religious process, and instead they advise people in general to work for material advancement. This is going on all over the world. Not only now but since time immemorial, no one is interested in <span class="Italic">mok&#7779;a,</span> liberation. There are four principles&mdash;<span class="Italic">dharma</span> (religion), <span class="Italic">artha</span> (economic development), <span class="Italic">k&#257;ma</span> (sense gratification) and <span class="Italic">mok&#7779;a</span> (liberation). People accept religion to become materially opulent. And why should one be materially opulent? For sense gratification. Thus people prefer these three <span class="Italic">m&#257;rgas,</span> the three paths of materialistic life. No one is interested in liberation, and <span class="Italic">bhagavad-bhakti,</span> devotional service to the Lord, is above even liberation. Therefore the process of devotional service, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, is extremely difficult to understand. This will be explained later by Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. The teachers &#7778;a&#7751;&#7693;a and Amarka tried to induce Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja to accept the materialistic way of life, but actually their attempt was a failure.</div>

Then, one day, after Prahl&#257;da&rsquo;s mother had personally washed the boy and dressed him nicely with sufficient ornaments, they presented him before his father.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">It is essential for a student who is going to be a ruler or king to learn the four diplomatic principles. There is always rivalry between a king and his citizens. Therefore, when a citizen agitates the public against the king, the duty of the king is to call him and try to pacify him with sweet words, saying, &ldquo;You are very important in the state. Why should you disturb the public with some new cause for agitation?&rdquo; If the citizen is not pacified, the king should then offer him some lucrative post as a governor or minister&mdash;any post that draws a high salary&mdash;so that he may be agreeable. If the enemy still goes on agitating the public, the king should try to create dissension in the enemy&rsquo;s camp, but if he still continues, the king should employ <span class="Italic">argumentum ad baculum</span>&mdash;severe punishment&mdash;by putting him in jail or placing him before a firing squad. The teachers appointed by Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu taught Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja how to be a diplomat so that he could rule over the citizens very nicely.</div>

<div class="Translation">Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja said: Hearing and chanting about the transcendental holy name, form, qualities, paraphernalia and pastimes of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, remembering them, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering the Lord respectful worship with sixteen types of paraphernalia, offering prayers to the Lord, becoming His servant, considering the Lord one&rsquo;s best friend, and surrendering everything unto Him (in other words, serving Him with the body, mind and words)&mdash;these nine processes are accepted as pure devotional service. One who has dedicated his life to the service of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a through these nine methods should be understood to be the most learned person, for he has acquired complete knowledge.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">When Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was asked by his father to say something from whatever he had learned, he considered that what he had learned from his spiritual master was the best of all teachings whereas what he had learned about diplomacy from his material teachers, &#7778;a&#7751;&#7693;a and Amarka, was useless. <span class="Italic">Bhakti&#7717; pare&#347;&#257;nubhavo viraktir anyatra ca</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> 11.2.42). This is the symptom of pure devotional service. A pure devotee is interested only in devotional service, not in material affairs. To execute devotional service, one should always engage in hearing and chanting about K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, or Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. The process of temple worship is called <span class="Italic">arcana.</span> How to perform <span class="Italic">arcana</span> will be explained herein. One should have complete faith in the words of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who says that He is the great well-wishing friend of everyone (<span class="Italic">suh&#7771;da&#7745; sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;n&#257;m</span>). A devotee considers K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a the only friend. This is called <span class="Italic">sakhyam.</span> <span class="Italic">Pu&#7745;s&#257;rpit&#257; vi&#7779;&#7751;au.</span> The word <span class="Italic">pu&#7745;s&#257;</span> means &ldquo;by all living entities.&rdquo; There are no distinctions permitting only a man or only a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> to offer devotional service to the Lord. Everyone can do so. As confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index27a1.html?g=3273">9.32</a>), <span class="Italic">striyo vai&#347;y&#257;s tath&#257; &#347;&#363;dr&#257;s te &rsquo;pi y&#257;nti par&#257;&#7745; gatim:</span> although women, <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> are considered less intelligent, they also can become devotees and return home, back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purport">After performing sacrifices, sometimes a person engaged in fruitive activity customarily offers the results to Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. But here it is said, <span class="Italic">bhagavaty addh&#257;:</span> one must directly offer everything to Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. This is called <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> (not merely <span class="Italic">ny&#257;sa</span>). A <span class="Italic">trida&#7751;&#7693;i-sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> carries three <span class="Italic">da&#7751;&#7693;as,</span> signifying <span class="Italic">kaya-mano-v&#257;kya</span>&mdash;body, mind and words. All of these should be offered to Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and then one can begin devotional service. Fruitive workers first perform some pious activities and then formally or officially offer the results to Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. The real devotee, however, first offers his surrender to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a with his body, mind and words and then uses his body, mind and words for the service of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a desires.</div>
<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299;la Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura gives the following explanation in his <span class="Italic">Tathya.</span> The word <span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;a</span> refers to giving aural reception to the holy name and descriptions of the Lord&rsquo;s form, qualities, entourage and pastimes as explained in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and similar authorized scriptures. After aurally receiving such messages, one should memorize these vibrations and repeat them (<span class="Italic">k&#299;rtanam</span>). <span class="Italic">Smara&#7751;am</span> means trying to understand more and more about the Supreme Lord, and <span class="Italic">p&#257;da-sevanam</span> means engaging oneself in serving the lotus feet of the Lord according to the time and circumstances. <span class="Italic">Arcanam</span> means worshiping Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u as one does in the temple, and <span class="Italic">vandanam</span> means offering respectful obeisances. <span class="Italic">Man-man&#257; bhava mad-bhakto mad-y&#257;j&#299; m&#257;&#7745; namaskuru</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index673b.html?g=5988">18.65</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> <span class="Italic">Vandanam</span> means <span class="Italic">namaskuru</span>&mdash;offering obeisances or offering prayers. Thinking oneself to be <span class="Italic">nitya-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-d&#257;sa,</span> everlastingly a servant of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, is called <span class="Italic">d&#257;syam,</span> and <span class="Italic">sakhyam</span> means being a well-wisher of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a wants everyone to surrender unto Him because everyone is constitutionally His servant. Therefore, as a sincere friend of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, one should preach this philosophy, requesting everyone to surrender unto K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. <span class="Italic">&#256;tma-nivedanam</span> means offering K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a everything, including one&rsquo;s body, mind, intelligence and whatever one may possess.</div>
<div class="Purport">One&rsquo;s sincere endeavor to perform these nine processes of devotional service is technically called <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> The word <span class="Italic">addh&#257;</span> means &ldquo;directly&rdquo; One should not be like the <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s,</span> who perform pious activities and then formally offer the results to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. That is <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a.</span> One should not aspire for the results of his pious activities, but should dedicate oneself fully and then act piously. In other words, one should act for the satisfaction of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, not for the satisfaction of his own senses. That is the meaning of the word <span class="Italic">addh&#257;,</span> &ldquo;directly.&rdquo;</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">any&#257;bhil&#257;&#7779;it&#257;-&#347;&#363;nya&#7745;<br>j&ntilde;&#257;na-karm&#257;dy-an&#257;v&#7771;tam<br>&#257;nuk&#363;lyena k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;&#257;nu-<br>&#347;&#299;lana&#7745; bhaktir uttam&#257;<br></I> [Madhya </I><a href="index9f17.html?g=124267">19.167</a></I>]</I></div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service.&rdquo; One should simply satisfy K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, without being influenced by fruitive knowledge or fruitive activity.</div>
<div class="Purport">The <span class="Italic">Gop&#257;la-t&#257;pan&#299; Upani&#7779;ad</span> says that the word <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> means engagement in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, not of anyone else. This <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ad</span> describes that <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is the offering of devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. To perform devotional service, one should be relieved of the bodily conception of life and aspirations to be happy through elevation to the higher planetary systems. In other words, work performed simply for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, without any desire for material benefits, is called <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> is also called <span class="Italic">ni&#7779;karma,</span> or freedom from the results of fruitive activity. <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> and <span class="Italic">ni&#7779;karma</span> are on the same platform, although devotional service and fruitive activity appear almost the same.</div>
<div class="Purport">The nine different processes enunciated by Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, who learned them from N&#257;rada Muni, may not all be required for the execution of devotional service; if a devotee performs only one of these nine without deviation, he can attain the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sometimes it is found that when one performs one of the processes, other processes are mixed with it. That is not improper for a devotee. When a devotee executes any one of the nine processes (<span class="Italic">nava-lak&#7779;a&#7751;&#257;</span>), this is sufficient; the other eight processes are included. Now let us discuss these nine different processes.</div>
<div class="Purport">(1) <span class="Italic">&#346;rava&#7751;am.</span> Hearing of the holy name of the Lord (<span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;am</span>) is the beginning of devotional service. Although any one of the nine processes is sufficient, in chronological order the hearing of the holy name of the Lord is the beginning. Indeed, it is essential. As enunciated by Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, <span class="Italic">ceto-darpa&#7751;a-m&#257;rjanam:</I> [Cc. Antya </I><a href="index0860.html?g=154712">20.12</a></I>]</span></I> by chanting the holy name of the Lord, one is cleansed of the material conception of life, which is due to the dirty modes of material nature. When the dirt is cleansed from the core of one&rsquo;s heart, one can realize the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead&mdash;<span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;vara&#7717; parama&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&#7717; sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha&#7717; </I>[</I>Bs. </span>5.1</I>]<span class="Italic"></I>.</span> Thus by hearing the holy name of the Lord, one comes to the platform of understanding the personal form of the Lord. After realizing the Lord&rsquo;s form, one can realize the transcendental qualities of the Lord, and when one can understand His transcendental qualities one can understand the Lord&rsquo;s associates. In this way a devotee advances further and further toward complete understanding of the Lord as he awakens in realization of the Lord&rsquo;s holy name, transcendental form and qualities, His paraphernalia, and everything pertaining to Him. Therefore the chronological process is <span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;a&#7745; k&#299;rtana&#7745; vi&#7779;&#7751;o&#7717; </I>[SB </span></I><a href="indexda76.html?g=55355">7.5.23</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> This same process of chronological understanding holds true in chanting and remembering. When the chanting of the holy name, form, qualities and paraphernalia is heard from the mouth of a pure devotee, his hearing and chanting are very pleasing. &#346;r&#299;la San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299; has forbidden us to hear the chanting of an artificial devotee or nondevotee.</div>
<div class="Purport">Hearing from the text of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is considered the most important process of hearing. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is full of transcendental chanting of the holy name, and therefore the chanting and hearing of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> are transcendentally full of mellows. The transcendental holy name of the Lord may be heard and chanted accordingly to the attraction of the devotee. One may chant the holy name of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, or one may chant the holy name of Lord R&#257;ma or N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva (<span class="Italic">r&#257;m&#257;di-m&#363;rti&#7779;u kal&#257;-niyamena ti&#7779;&#7789;han</I> [Bs. </span></I>5.39]). The Lord has innumerable forms and names, and devotees may meditate upon a particular form and chant the holy name according to his attraction. The best course is to hear of the holy name, form and so on from a pure devotee of the same standard as oneself. In other words, one who is attached to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a should chant and hear from other pure devotees who are also attached to Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The same principle applies for devotees attracted by Lord R&#257;ma, Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;ha and other forms of the Lord. Because K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the ultimate form of the Lord (<span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;as tu bhagav&#257;n svayam</span>), it is best to hear about Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s name, form and pastimes from a realized devotee who is particularly attracted by the form of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. In <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> great devotees like &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; have specifically described Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s holy name, form and qualities. Unless one hears about the holy name, form and qualities of the Lord, one cannot clearly understand the other processes of devotional service. Therefore &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu recommends that one chant the holy name of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. <span class="Italic">para&#7745; vijayate &#347;r&#299;-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-sa&#7749;k&#299;rtanam.</span> If one is fortunate enough to hear from the mouth of realized devotees, he is very easily successful on the path of devotional service. Therefore hearing of the holy name, form and qualities of the Lord is essential.</div>
<div class="Purport">In <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="indexd459.html?g=7422">1.5.11</a>) there is this verse:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">tad-v&#257;g-visargo janat&#257;gha-viplavo<br>yasmin prati-&#347;lokam abaddhavaty api<br>n&#257;m&#257;ny anantasya ya&#347;o-&rsquo;&#7749;kit&#257;ni yat<br>&#347;&#7771;&#7751;vanti g&#257;yanti g&#7771;&#7751;anti s&#257;dhava&#7717;</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Verses describing the name, form and qualities of Anantadeva, the unlimited Supreme Lord, are able to vanquish all the sinful reactions of the entire world. Therefore even if such verses are improperly composed, devotees hear them, describe them and accept them as bona fide and authorized.&rdquo; In this connection, &#346;r&#299;dhara Sv&#257;m&#299; has remarked that a pure devotee takes advantage of another pure devotee by trying to hear from him about the holy name, form and qualities of the Lord. If there is no such opportunity, he alone chants and hears the Lord&rsquo;s holy name.</div>
<div class="Purport">(2) <span class="Italic">K&#299;rtanam.</span> The hearing of the holy name has been described above. Now let us try to understand the chanting of the holy name, which is the second item in the consecutive order. It is recommended that such chanting be performed very loudly. In <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> N&#257;rada Muni says that without shame he began traveling all over the world, chanting the holy name of the Lord. Similarly, &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu has advised:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">t&#7771;&#7751;&#257;d api sun&#299;cena<br>taror api sahi&#7779;&#7751;un&#257;<br>am&#257;nin&#257; m&#257;nadena<br>k&#299;rtan&#299;ya&#7717; sad&#257; hari&#7717;<br></I> [Cc. adi </I><a href="index5365.html?g=93806">17.31</a></I>]</I></div>
<div class="After-Verse">A devotee can very peacefully chant the holy name of the Lord by behaving more humbly than the grass, being tolerant like a tree and offering respects to everyone, without expecting honor from anyone else. Such qualifications make it easier to chant the holy name of the Lord. The process of transcendental chanting can be easily performed by anyone. Even if one is physically unfit, classified lower than others, devoid of material qualifications or not at all elevated in terms of pious activities, the chanting of the holy name is beneficial. An aristocratic birth, an advanced education, beautiful bodily features, wealth and similar results of pious activities are all unnecessary for advancement in spiritual life, for one can very easily advance simply by chanting the holy name. It is understood from the authoritative source of Vedic literature that especially in this age, Kali-yuga, people are generally short-living, extremely bad in their habits, and inclined to accept methods of devotional service that are not bona fide. Moreover, they are always disturbed by material conditions, and they are mostly unfortunate. Under the circumstances, the performance of other processes, such as <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a, d&#257;na, tapa&#7717;</span> and <span class="Italic">kriy&#257;</span>&mdash;sacrifices, charity and so on&mdash;are not at all possible. Therefore it is recommended:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">harer n&#257;ma harer n&#257;ma<br>harer n&#257;maiva kevalam<br>kalau n&#257;sty eva n&#257;sty eva<br>n&#257;sty eva gatir anyath&#257;<br></I> [Adi </I><a href="indexd751.html?g=93741">17.21</a></I>]</I></div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting of the holy name of the Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way.&rdquo; Simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord, one advances perfectly in spiritual life. This is the best process for success in life. In other ages, the chanting of the holy name is equally powerful, but especially in this age, Kali-yuga, it is most powerful. <span class="Italic">K&#299;rtan&#257;d eva k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;asya mukta-sa&#7749;ga&#7717; para&#7745; vrajet:</span> simply by chanting the holy name of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, one is liberated and returns home, back to Godhead. Therefore, even if one is able to perform other processes of devotional service, one must adopt the chanting of the holy name as the principal method of advancing in spiritual life. <span class="Italic">Yaj&ntilde;ai&#7717; sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana-pr&#257;yair yajanti hi sumedhasa&#7717;:</span></I> [SB </I>11.5.32</I>]</I> those who are very sharp in their intelligence should adopt this process of chanting the holy names of the Lord. One should not, however, manufacture different types of chanting. One should adhere seriously to the chanting of the holy name as recommended in the scriptures: Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare Hare/ Hare R&#257;ma, Hare R&#257;ma, R&#257;ma R&#257;ma, Hare Hare.</div>
<div class="Purport">While chanting the holy name of the Lord, one should be careful to avoid ten offenses. From Sanat-kum&#257;ra it is understood that even if a person is a severe offender in many ways, he is freed from offensive life if he takes shelter of the Lord&rsquo;s holy name. Indeed, even if a human being is no better than a two-legged animal, he will be liberated if he takes shelter of the holy name of the Lord. One should therefore be very careful not to commit offenses at the lotus feet of the Lord&rsquo;s holy name. The offenses are described as follows: (<span class="Italic">a</span>) to blaspheme a devotee, especially a devotee engaged in broadcasting the glories of the holy name, (<span class="Italic">b</span>) to consider the name of Lord &#346;iva or any other demigod to be equally as powerful as the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (no one is equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, nor is anyone superior to Him), (<span class="Italic">c</span>) to disobey the instructions of the spiritual master, (<span class="Italic">d</span>) to blaspheme the Vedic literatures and literatures compiled in pursuance of the Vedic literatures, (<span class="Italic">e</span>) to comment that the glories of the holy name of the Lord are exaggerated, (<span class="Italic">f</span>) to interpret the holy name in a deviant way, (<span class="Italic">g</span>) to commit sinful activities on the strength of chanting the holy name, (<span class="Italic">h</span>) to compare the chanting of the holy name to pious activities, (<span class="Italic">i</span>) to instruct the glories of the holy name to a person who has no understanding of the chanting of the holy name, (<span class="Italic">j</span>) not to awaken in transcendental attachment for the chanting of the holy name, even after hearing all these scriptural injunctions.</div>
<div class="Purport">There is no way to atone for any of these offenses. It is therefore recommended that an offender at the feet of the holy name continue to chant the holy name twenty-four hours a day. Constant chanting of the holy name will make one free of offenses, and then he will gradually be elevated to the transcendental platform on which he can chant the pure holy name and thus become a lover of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purport">It is recommended that even if one commits offenses, one should continue chanting the holy name. In other words, the chanting of the holy name makes one offenseless. In the book <span class="Italic">N&#257;ma-kaumud&#299;</span> it is recommended that if one is an offender at the lotus feet of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, he should submit to that Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava and be excused; similarly, if one is an offender in chanting the holy name, he should submit to the holy name and thus be freed from his offenses. In this connection there is the following statement, spoken by Dak&#7779;a to Lord &#346;iva: &ldquo;I did not know the glories of your personality, and therefore I committed an offense at your lotus feet in the open assembly. You are so kind, however, that you did not accept my offense. Instead, when I was falling down because of accusing you, you saved me by your merciful glance. You are most great. Kindly excuse me and be satisfied with your own exalted qualities.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">One should be very humble and meek to offer one&rsquo;s desires and chant prayers composed in glorification of the holy name, such as <span class="Italic">ayi mukta-kulair up&#257;sya m&#257;nam</span> and <span class="Italic">niv&#7771;tta-tar&#7779;air upag&#299;yam&#257;n&#257;d</I> [SB </span></I><a href="indexc06b-2.html?g=75257">10.1.4</a><span class="Italic"></I>]</I>.</span> One should chant such prayers to become free from offenses at the lotus feet of the holy name.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;O King, for great <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> who have completely renounced all material connections, for those who desire all material enjoyment and for those who are self-satisfied by dint of transcendental knowledge, constant chanting of the holy name of the Lord is recommended.&rdquo; According to different relationships with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there are varieties of <span class="Italic">n&#257;m&#257;nuk&#299;rtanam,</span> chanting of the holy name, and thus according to different relationships and mellows there are five kinds of remembering. These are as follows: (<span class="Italic">a</span>) conducting research into the worship of a particular form of the Lord, (<span class="Italic">b</span>) concentrating the mind on one subject and withdrawing the mind&rsquo;s activities of thinking, feeling and willing from all other subjects, (<span class="Italic">c</span>) concentrating upon a particular form of the Lord (this is called meditation), (<span class="Italic">d</span>) concentrating one&rsquo;s mind continuously on the form of the Lord (this is called <span class="Italic">dhruv&#257;nusm&#7771;ti,</span> or perfect meditation), and (<span class="Italic">e</span>) awakening a likening for concentration upon a particular form (this is called <span class="Italic">sam&#257;dhi,</span> or trance). Mental concentration upon particular pastimes of the Lord in particular circumstances is also called remembrance. Therefore <span class="Italic">sam&#257;dhi,</span> trance, can be possible in five different ways in terms of one&rsquo;s relationship. Specifically, the trance of devotees on the stage of neutrality is called mental concentration.</div>
<div class="Purport">(4) <span class="Italic">p&#257;da-sevanam.</span> According to one&rsquo;s taste and strength, hearing, chanting and remembrance may be followed by <span class="Italic">p&#257;da-sevanam.</span> One obtains the perfection of remembering when one constantly thinks of the lotus feet of the Lord. Being intensely attached to thinking of the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet is called <span class="Italic">p&#257;da-sevanam.</span> When one is particularly adherent to the process of <span class="Italic">p&#257;da-sevanam,</span> this process gradually includes other processes, such as seeing the form of the Lord, touching the form of the Lord, circumambulating the form or temple of the Lord, visiting such places as Jagann&#257;tha Pur&#299;, Dv&#257;rak&#257; and Mathur&#257; to see the Lord&rsquo;s form, and bathing in the Ganges or Yamun&#257;. Bathing in the Ganges and serving a pure Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava are also known as <span class="Italic">tad&#299;ya-up&#257;sanam.</span> This is also <span class="Italic">p&#257;da-sevanam.</span> The word <span class="Italic">tad&#299;ya</span> means &ldquo;in relationship with the Lord.&rdquo; Service to the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, Tulas&#299;, Ganges and Yamun&#257; are included in <span class="Italic">p&#257;da-sevanam.</span> All these processes of <span class="Italic">p&#257;da-sevanam</span> help one advance in spiritual life very quickly.</div>
<div class="Purport">(5) <span class="Italic">Arcanam.</span> After <span class="Italic">p&#257;da-sevanam</span> comes the process of <span class="Italic">arcanam,</span> worship of the Deity. If one is interested in the process of <span class="Italic">arcanam,</span> one must positively take shelter of a bona fide spiritual master and learn the process from him. There are many books for <span class="Italic">arcana,</span> especially <span class="Italic">N&#257;rada-pa&ntilde;car&#257;tra.</span> In this age, the <span class="Italic">pa&ntilde;car&#257;tra</span> system is particularly recommended for <span class="Italic">arcana,</span> Deity worship. There are two systems of <span class="Italic">arcana</span>&mdash;the <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavata</span> system and <span class="Italic">p&#257;&ntilde;car&#257;trik&#299;</span> system. In the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> there is no recommendation of <span class="Italic">p&#257;&ntilde;car&#257;trik&#299;</span> worship because in this Kali-yuga, even without Deity worship, everything can be perfectly performed simply through hearing, chanting, remembering and worship of the lotus feet of the Lord. R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; states:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">&#347;r&#299;-vi&#7779;&#7751;o&#7717; &#347;rava&#7751;e par&#299;k&#7779;id abhavad vaiy&#257;saki&#7717; k&#299;rtane<br>prahl&#257;da&#7717; smara&#7751;e tad-a&#7749;ghri-bhajane lak&#7779;m&#299;&#7717; p&#7771;thu&#7717; p&#363;jane<br>akr&#363;ras tv abhivandane kapi-patir d&#257;sye &rsquo;tha sakhye &rsquo;rjuna&#7717;<br>sarvasv&#257;tma-nivedane balir abh&#363;t k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;&#257;ptir e&#7779;&#257;&#7745; param</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja attained salvation simply by hearing, and &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; attained salvation simply by chanting. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja attained salvation by remembering the Lord. The goddess of fortune, Lak&#7779;m&#299;dev&#299;, attained perfection by worshiping the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet. P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja attained salvation by worshiping the Deity of the Lord. Akr&#363;ra attained salvation by offering prayers, Hanum&#257;n by rendering service, Arjuna by establishing friendship with the Lord, and Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja by offering everything to the service of the Lord.&rdquo; All these great devotees served the Lord according to a particular process, but every one of them attained salvation and became eligible to return home, back to Godhead. This is explained in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">It is therefore recommended that initiated devotees follow the principles of <span class="Italic">N&#257;rada-pa&ntilde;car&#257;tra</span> by worshiping the Deity in the temple. Especially for householder devotees who are opulent in material possessions, the path of Deity worship is strongly recommended. An opulent householder devotee who does not engage his hard-earned money in the service of the Lord is called a miser. One should not engage paid <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> to worship the Deity. If one does not personally worship the Deity but engages paid servants instead, he is considered lazy, and his worship of the Deity is called artificial. An opulent householder can collect luxurious paraphernalia for Deity worship, and consequently for householder devotees the worship of the Deity is compulsory. In our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement there are <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;s, g&#7771;hasthas, v&#257;naprasthas</span> and <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s,</span> but the Deity worship in the temple should be performed especially by the householders. The <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;s</span> can go with the <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s</span> to preach, and the <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprasthas</span> should prepare themselves for the next status of renounced life, <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa.</span> <span class="Italic">G&#7771;hastha</span> devotees, however, are generally engaged in material activities, and therefore if they do not take to Deity worship, their falling down is positively assured. Deity worship means following the rules and regulations precisely. That will keep one steady in devotional service. Generally householders have children, and then the wives of the householders should be engaged in caring for the children, just as women acting as teachers care for the children in a nursery school.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">G&#7771;hastha</span> devotees must adopt the <span class="Italic">arcana-vidhi,</span> or Deity worship according to the suitable arrangements and directions given by the spiritual master. Regarding those unable to take to the Deity worship in the temple, there is the following statement in the <span class="Italic">Agni Pur&#257;&#7751;a.</span> Any householder devotee circumstantially unable to worship the Deity must at least see the Deity worship, and in this way he may achieve success also. The special purpose of Deity worship is to keep oneself always pure and clean. <span class="Italic">G&#7771;hastha</span> devotees should be actual examples of cleanliness.</div>
<div class="Purport">Deity worship should be continued along with hearing and chanting. Therefore every <span class="Italic">mantra</span> is preceded by the word <span class="Italic">nama&#7717;.</span> In all the <span class="Italic">mantras</span> there are specific potencies, of which the <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> devotees must take advantage. There are many <span class="Italic">mantras</span> preceded by the word <span class="Italic">nama&#7717;,</span> but if one chants the holy name of the Lord, he receives the result of chanting <span class="Italic">nama&#7717;</span> many times. By chanting the holy name of the Lord, one can reach the platform of love of Godhead. One might ask, then what is the necessity of being initiated? The answer is that even though the chanting of the holy name is sufficient to enable one to progress in spiritual life to the standard of love of Godhead, one is nonetheless susceptible to contamination because of possessing a material body. Consequently, special stress is given to the <span class="Italic">arcana-vidhi.</span> One should therefore regularly take advantage of both the <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavata</span> process and <span class="Italic">p&#257;&ntilde;car&#257;trik&#299;</span> process.</div>
<div class="Purport">Deity worship has two divisions, namely pure and mixed with fruitive activities. For one who is steady, Deity worship is compulsory. Observing the various types of festivals, such as <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299; Janm&#257;&#7779;&#7789;am&#299;, R&#257;ma-navam&#299;</span> and <span class="Italic">N&#7771;si&#7745;ha-caturda&#347;&#299;,</span> is also included in the process of Deity worship. In other words, it is compulsory for householder devotees to observe these festivals.</div>
<div class="Purport">Now let us discuss the offenses in Deity worship. The following are offenses: (<span class="Italic">a</span>) to enter the temple with shoes or being carried on a palanquin, (<span class="Italic">b</span>) not to observe the prescribed festivals, (<span class="Italic">c</span>) to avoid offering obeisances in front of the Deity, (<span class="Italic">d</span>) to offer prayers in an unclean state, not having washed one&rsquo;s hands after eating, (<span class="Italic">e</span>) to offer obeisances with one hand, (<span class="Italic">f</span>) to circumambulate directly in front of the Deity, (<span class="Italic">g</span>) to spread one&rsquo;s legs before the Deity, (<span class="Italic">h</span>) to sit before the Deity while holding one&rsquo;s ankles with one&rsquo;s hands, (<span class="Italic">i</span>) to lie down before the Deity, (<span class="Italic">j</span>) to eat before the Deity, (<span class="Italic">k</span>) to speak lies before the Deity, (<span class="Italic">l</span>) to address someone loudly before the Deity, (<span class="Italic">m</span>) to talk nonsense before the Deity, (<span class="Italic">n</span>) to cry before the Deity, (<span class="Italic">o</span>) to argue before the Deity, (<span class="Italic">p</span>) to chastise someone before the Deity, (<span class="Italic">q</span>) to show someone favor before the Deity, (<span class="Italic">r</span>) to use harsh words before the Deity, (<span class="Italic">s</span>) to wear a woolen blanket before the Deity, (<span class="Italic">t</span>) to blaspheme someone before the Deity, (<span class="Italic">u</span>) to worship someone else before the Deity, (<span class="Italic">v</span>) to use vulgar language before the Deity, (<span class="Italic">w</span>) to pass air before the Deity, (<span class="Italic">x</span>) to avoid very opulent worship of the Deity, even though one is able to perform it, (<span class="Italic">y</span>) to eat something not offered to the Deity, (<span class="Italic">z</span>) to avoid offering fresh fruits to the Deity according to the season, (<span class="Italic">aa</span>) to offer food to the Deity which has already been used or from which has first been given to others (in other words, food should not be distributed to anyone else until it has been offered to the Deity), (<span class="Italic">bb</span>) to sit with one&rsquo;s back toward the Deity, (<span class="Italic">cc</span>) to offer obeisances to someone else in front of the Deity, (<span class="Italic">dd</span>) not to chant proper prayers when offering obeisances to the spiritual master, (<span class="Italic">ee</span>) to praise oneself before the Deity, and (<span class="Italic">ff</span>) to blaspheme the demigods. In the worship of the Deity, these thirty-two offenses should be avoided.</div>
<div class="Purport">In the <span class="Italic">Var&#257;ha Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> the following offenses are mentioned: (<span class="Italic">a</span>) to eat in the house of a rich man, (<span class="Italic">b</span>) to enter the Deity&rsquo;s room in the dark, (<span class="Italic">c</span>) to worship the Deity without following the regulative principles, (<span class="Italic">d</span>) to enter the temple without vibrating any sound, (<span class="Italic">e</span>) to collect food that has been seen by a dog, (<span class="Italic">f</span>) to break silence while offering worship to the Deity, (<span class="Italic">g</span>) to go to the toilet during the time of worshiping the Deity, (<span class="Italic">h</span>) to offer incense without offering flowers, (<span class="Italic">i</span>) to worship the Deity with forbidden flowers, (<span class="Italic">j</span>) to begin worship without having washed one&rsquo;s teeth, (<span class="Italic">k</span>) to begin worship after sex, (<span class="Italic">l</span>) to touch a lamp, dead body or a woman during her menstrual period, or to put on red or bluish clothing, unwashed clothing, the clothing of others or soiled clothing. Other offenses are to worship the Deity after seeing a dead body, to pass air before the Deity, to show anger before the Deity, and to worship the Deity just after returning from a crematorium. After eating, one should not worship the Deity until one has digested his food, nor should one touch the Deity or engage in any Deity worship after eating safflower oil or hing. These are also offenses.</div>
<div class="Purport">In other places, the following offenses are listed: (<span class="Italic">a</span>) to be against the scriptural injunctions of the Vedic literature or to disrespect within one&rsquo;s heart the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> while externally falsely accepting its principles, (<span class="Italic">b</span>) to introduce differing <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras,</span> (<span class="Italic">c</span>) to chew pan and betel before the Deity, (<span class="Italic">d</span>) to keep flowers for worship on the leaf of a castor oil plant, (<span class="Italic">e</span>) to worship the Deity in the afternoon, (<span class="Italic">f</span>) to sit on the altar or to sit on the floor to worship the Deity (without a seat), (<span class="Italic">g</span>) to touch the Deity with the left hand while bathing the Deity, (<span class="Italic">h</span>) to worship the Deity with a stale or used flower, (<span class="Italic">i</span>) to spit while worshiping the Deity, (<span class="Italic">j</span>) to advertise one&rsquo;s glory while worshiping the Deity, (<span class="Italic">k</span>) to apply <span class="Italic">tilaka</span> to one&rsquo;s forehead in a curved way, (<span class="Italic">l</span>) to enter the temple without having washed one&rsquo;s feet, (<span class="Italic">m</span>) to offer the Deity food cooked by an uninitiated person, (<span class="Italic">n</span>) to worship the Deity and offer <span class="Italic">bhoga</span> to the Deity within the vision of an uninitiated person or non-Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, (<span class="Italic">o</span>) to offer worship to the Deity without worshiping Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha deities like Ga&#7751;e&#347;a, (<span class="Italic">p</span>) to worship the Deity while perspiring, (<span class="Italic">q</span>) to refuse flowers offered to the Deity, (<span class="Italic">r</span>) to take a vow or oath in the holy name of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purport">If one commits any of the above offenses, one must read at least one chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> This is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Skanda-Pur&#257;&#7751;a, Avant&#299;-kha&#7751;&#7693;a.</span> Similarly, there is another injunction, stating that one who reads the thousand names of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u can be released from all offenses. In the same <span class="Italic">Skanda-Pur&#257;&#7751;a, Rev&#257;-kha&#7751;&#7693;a,</span> it is said that one who recites prayers to <span class="Italic">tulas&#299;</span> or sows a <span class="Italic">tulas&#299;</span> seed is also freed from all offenses. Similarly, one who worships the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;lagr&#257;ma-&#347;il&#257;</span> can also be relieved of offenses. In the <span class="Italic">Brahma-&#7751;&#7693;a Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> it is said that one who worships Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, whose four hands bear a conchshell, disc, lotus flower and club, can be relieved from the above offenses. In the <span class="Italic">&#256;di-var&#257;ha Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> it is said that a worshiper who has committed offenses may fast for one day at the holy place known as &#346;aukarava and then bathe in the Ganges.</div>
<div class="Purport">In the process of worshiping the Deity it is sometimes enjoined that one worship the Deity within the mind. In the <span class="Italic">Padma Pur&#257;&#7751;a, Uttara-kha&#7751;&#7693;a,</span> it is said, &ldquo;All persons can generally worship within the mind.&rdquo; The <span class="Italic">Gautam&#299;ya Tantra</span> states, &ldquo;For a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> who has no home, worship of the Deity within the mind is recommended.&rdquo; In the <span class="Italic">N&#257;rada-pa&ntilde;car&#257;tra</span> it is stated by Lord N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a that worship of the Deity within the mind is called <span class="Italic">m&#257;nasa-p&#363;j&#257;,</span> One can become free from the four miseries by this method. Sometimes worship from the mind can be independently executed. According to the instruction of Avirhotra Muni, one of the <span class="Italic">nava-yogendras,</span> as mentioned in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> one may worship the Deity by chanting all the <span class="Italic">mantras.</span> Eight kinds of Deities are mentioned in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra,</span> and the mental Deity is one of them. In this regard, the following description is given in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-vaivarta Pur&#257;&#7751;a.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">In the city of Prati&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;na-pura, long ago, there resided a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> who was poverty-stricken but innocent and not dissatisfied. One day he heard a discourse in an assembly of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> concerning how to worship the Deity in the temple. In that meeting, he also heard that the Deity may be worshiped within the mind. After this incident, the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> having bathed in the God&#257;var&#299; River, began mentally worshiping the Deity. He would wash the temple within his mind, and then in his imagination he would bring water from all the sacred rivers in golden and silver waterpots. He collected all kinds of valuable paraphernalia for worship, and he worshiped the Deity very gorgeously, beginning from bathing the Deity and ending with offering <span class="Italic">&#257;rati.</span> Thus he felt great happiness. After many years had passed in this way, one day within his mind he cooked nice sweet rice with ghee to worship the Deity. He placed the sweet rice on a golden dish and offered it to Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, but he felt that the sweet rice was very hot, and therefore he touched it with his finger. He immediately felt that his finger had been burned by the hot sweet rice, and thus he began to lament. While the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> was in pain, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u in Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha began smiling, and the goddess of fortune inquired from the Lord why He was smiling. Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u then ordered His associates to bring the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> to Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha. Thus the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> attained the liberation of <span class="Italic">s&#257;m&#299;pya,</span> the facility of living near the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purport">(6) <span class="Italic">Vandanam.</span> Although prayers are a part of Deity worship, they may be considered separately like the other items, such as hearing and chanting, and therefore separate statements are given herewith. The Lord has unlimited transcendental qualities and opulences, and one who feels influenced by the Lord&rsquo;s qualities in various activities offers prayers to the Lord. In this way he becomes successful. In this connection, the following are some of the offenses to be avoided: (<span class="Italic">a</span>) to offer obeisances on one hand, (<span class="Italic">b</span>) to offer obeisances with one&rsquo;s body covered, (<span class="Italic">c</span>) to show one&rsquo;s back to the Deity, (<span class="Italic">d</span>) to offer obeisances on the left side of the Deity, (<span class="Italic">e</span>) to offer obeisances very near the Deity.</div>
<div class="Purport">(7) <span class="Italic">D&#257;syam.</span> There is the following statement in regard to assisting the Lord as a servant. After many, many thousands of births, when one comes to understand that he is an eternal servant of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, one can deliver others from this universe. If one simply continues to think that he is an eternal servant of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, even without performing any other process of devotional service, he can attain full success, for simply by this feeling one can perform all nine processes of devotional service.</div>
<div class="Purport">(8) <span class="Italic">Sakhyam.</span> In regard to worshiping the Lord as a friend, the <span class="Italic">Agastya-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> states that a devotee engaged in performing devotional service by <span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;am</span> and <span class="Italic">k&#299;rtanam</span> sometimes wants to see the Lord personally, and for this purpose he resides in the temple. Elsewhere there is this statement: &ldquo;O my Lord, Supreme Personality and eternal friend, although You are full of bliss and knowledge, You have become the friend of the residents of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana. How fortunate are these devotees!&rdquo; In this statement the word &ldquo;friend&rdquo; is specifically used to indicate intense love. Friendship, therefore, is better than servitude. In the stage above <span class="Italic">d&#257;sya-rasa,</span> the devotee accepts the Supreme Personality of Godhead as a friend. This is not at all astonishing, for when a devotee is pure in heart the opulence of his worship of the Deity diminishes as spontaneous love for the Personality of Godhead is manifested. In this regard, &#346;r&#299;dhara Sv&#257;m&#299; mentions &#346;r&#299;d&#257;ma Vipra, who expressed to himself his feelings of obligation, thinking, &ldquo;Life after life, may I be connected with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in this friendly attitude.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">(9) <span class="Italic">&#256;tma-nivedanam.</span> The word <span class="Italic">&#256;tma-nivedanam</span> refers to the stage at which one who has no motive other than to serve the Lord surrenders everything to the Lord and performs his activities only to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a devotee is like a cow that is cared for by its master. When cared for by its master, a cow is not in anxiety over its maintenance. Such a cow is always devoted to its master, and it never acts independently, but only for the master&rsquo;s benefit. Some devotees, therefore, consider dedication of the body to the Lord to be <span class="Italic">&#257;tma-nivedanam,</span> and as stated in the book known as <span class="Italic">Bhakti-viveka,</span> sometimes dedication of the soul to the Lord is called <span class="Italic">&#257;tma-nivedanam.</span> The best examples of <span class="Italic">&#257;tma-nivedanam</span> are found in Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and Ambar&#299;&#7779;a Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. <span class="Italic">&#256;tma-nivedanam</span> is also sometimes found in the behavior of Rukmi&#7751;&#299;dev&#299; at Dv&#257;rak&#257;.</div>

<div class="Translation">Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja replied: Because of their uncontrolled senses, persons too addicted to materialistic life make progress toward hellish conditions and repeatedly chew that which has already been chewed. Their inclinations toward K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a are never aroused, either by the instructions of others, by their own efforts, or by a combination of both.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In this verse the words <span class="Italic">matir na k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;e</span> refer to devotional service rendered to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. So-called politicians, erudite scholars and philosophers who read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> try to twist some meaning from it to suit their material purposes, but their misunderstandings of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a will not yield them any profit. Because such politicians, philosophers and scholars are interested in using <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as a vehicle for adjusting things materially, for them constant thought of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, is impossible (<span class="Italic">matir na k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;e</span>). As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexbf7d.html?g=5898">18.55</a>), <span class="Italic">bhakty&#257; m&#257;m abhij&#257;n&#257;ti:</span> only through devotional service can one understand K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as He is. The so-called politicians and scholars think of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as fictitious. The politician says that his K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is different from the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a depicted in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> Even though he accepts K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and R&#257;ma as the Supreme he thinks of R&#257;ma and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as impersonal because he has no idea of service to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.

The aim of such politicians and academic scholars is to enjoy this material world with their bodily senses. Therefore it is clearly stated here that those who are <span class="Italic">g&#7771;ha-vrata,</span> whose only aim is to live comfortably with the body in the material world, cannot understand K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The two expressions <span class="Italic">g&#7771;ha-vrata</span> and <span class="Italic">carvita-carva&#7751;&#257;n&#257;m</span> indicate that a materialistic person tries to enjoy sense gratification in different bodily forms, life after life, but is still unsatisfied. In the name of personalism, this ism or that ism, such persons always remain attached to the materialistic way of life.

Unless one is properly trained by a <span class="Italic">mahat</span>&mdash;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;,</span> or unalloyed devotee of the Lord&mdash;there is no possibility of one&rsquo;s understanding K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and His devotional service.&rdquo;</div>

<div class="Translation">Persons who are strongly entrapped by the consciousness of enjoying material life, and who have therefore accepted as their leader or guru a similar blind man attached to external sense objects, cannot understand that the goal of life is to return home, back to Godhead, and engage in the service of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. As blind men guided by another blind man miss the right path and fall into a ditch, materially attached men led by another materially attached man are bound by the ropes of fruitive labor, which are made of very strong cords, and they continue again and again in materialistic life, suffering the threefold miseries.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Since there must always be a difference of opinion between demons and devotees, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, when criticized by his son Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, should not have been surprised that Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja differed from his way of life. Nonetheless, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was extremely angry and wanted to rebuke his son for deriding his teacher or spiritual master, who had been born in the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> family of the great <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya</span> &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya. The word <span class="Italic">&#347;ukra</span> means &ldquo;semen,&rdquo; and <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya</span> refers to a teacher or <span class="Italic">guru.</span> Hereditary <span class="Italic">gurus,</span> or spiritual masters, have been accepted everywhere since time immemorial, but Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja declined to accept such a seminal <span class="Italic">guru</span> or take instruction from him. An actual <span class="Italic">guru</span> is <span class="Italic">&#347;rotriya,</span> one who has heard or received perfect knowledge through <span class="Italic">parampar&#257;,</span> the disciplic succession. Therefore Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja did not recognize a seminal spiritual master. Such spiritual masters are not at all interested in Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Indeed, they are hopeful of material success (<span class="Italic">bahir-artha-m&#257;nina&#7717;</span>). The word <span class="Italic">bahi&#7717;</span> means &ldquo;external,&rdquo; <span class="Italic">artha</span> means &ldquo;interest,&rdquo; and <span class="Italic">m&#257;nina</span> means &ldquo;taking very seriously.&rdquo; Generally speaking, practically everyone is unaware of the spiritual world. The knowledge of the materialists is restricted within the four-billion-mile limit of this material world, which is in the dark portion of the creation; they do not know that beyond the material world is the spiritual world. Unless one is a devotee of the Lord, one cannot understand the existence of the spiritual world. <span class="Italic">Gurus,</span> teachers, who are simply interested in this material world are described in this verse as <span class="Italic">andha,</span> blind. Such blind men may lead many other blind followers without true knowledge of material conditions, but they are not accepted by devotees like Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. Such blind teachers, being interested in the external, material world, are always bound by the strong ropes of material nature.</div>

<div class="Translation">Unless they smear upon their bodies the dust of the lotus feet of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava completely freed from material contamination, persons very much inclined toward materialistic life cannot be attached to the lotus feet of the Lord, who is glorified for His uncommon activities. Only by becoming K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious and taking shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord in this way can one be freed from material contamination.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Becoming K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious brings about <span class="Italic">anartha-apagama&#7717;,</span> the disappearance of all <span class="Italic">anarthas,</span> the miserable conditions we have unnecessarily accepted. The material body is the basic principle of these unwanted miserable conditions. The entire Vedic civilization is meant to relieve one from these unwanted miseries, but persons bound by the laws of nature do not know the destination of life. As described in the previous verse, <span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;a-tantry&#257;m uru-d&#257;mni baddh&#257;&#7717;:</span> they are conditioned by the three strong modes of material nature. The education that keeps the conditioned soul bound life after life is called materialistic education. &#346;r&#299;la Bhaktivinoda &#7788;h&#257;kura has explained that materialistic education expands the influence of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> Such an education induces the conditioned soul to be increasingly attracted to materialistic life and to stray further and further away from liberation from unwanted miseries.</div>
<div class="Purport">One may ask why highly educated persons do not take to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. The reason is explained in this verse. Unless one takes shelter of a bona fide, fully K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious spiritual master, there is no chance of understanding K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The educators, scholars and big political leaders worshiped by millions of people cannot understand the goal of life and take to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, for they have not accepted a bona fide spiritual master and the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> Therefore in the <span class="Ref_Italic">Mu&#7751;&#7693;aka Upani&#7779;ad</span> (3.2.3) it is said, <span class="Italic">n&#257;yam &#257;tm&#257; pravacanena labhyo na medhay&#257; na bahun&#257; &#347;rutena:</span> one cannot become self-realized simply by having an academic education, by presenting lectures in an erudite way (<span class="Italic">pravacanena labhya&#7717;</span>), or by being an intelligent scientist who discovers many wonderful things. One cannot understand K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a unless one is graced by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Only one who has surrendered to a pure devotee of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and taken the dust of his lotus feet can understand K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. First one must understand how to get out of the clutches of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> The only means is to become K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious. And to become K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious very easily, one must take shelter of a realized soul&mdash;a <span class="Italic">mahat,</span> or <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;</span>&mdash;whose only interest is to engage in the service of the Supreme Lord.

<div class="Translation">Although a medicinal herb, being born in the forest, does not belong to the same category as a man, if beneficial it is kept very carefully. Similarly, if someone outside one&rsquo;s family is favorable, he should be given protection like a son. On the other hand, if a limb of one&rsquo;s body is poisoned by disease, it must be amputated so that the rest of the body may live happily. Similarly, even one&rsquo;s own son, if unfavorable, must be rejected, although born of one&rsquo;s own body.</div>

<div class="First">&#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu has instructed all devotees of the Lord to be humbler than the grass and more tolerant than trees; otherwise there will always be disturbances to their execution of devotional service. Here is a vivid example of how a devotee is disturbed by a nondevotee, even though the nondevotee is an affectionate father. The material world is such that a nondevotee father becomes an enemy of a devotee son. Having determined to kill even his son, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu gave the example of amputating a part of one&rsquo;s body that has become septic and therefore injurious to the rest of the body. The same example, of course, may also be applied to nondevotees. C&#257;&#7751;akya Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita advises, <span class="Italic">tyaja durjana-sa&#7745;sarga&#7745; bhaja s&#257;dhu-sam&#257;gamam.</span> Devotees actually serious about advancing in spiritual life should give up the company of nondevotees and always keep company with devotees. To be too attached to material existence is ignorance because material existence is temporary and miserable. Therefore devotees who are determined to perform <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> (penances and austerities) to realize the self, and who are determined to become advanced in spiritual consciousness, must give up the company of atheistic nondevotees. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja maintained an attitude of noncooperation with the philosophy of his father, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, yet he was tolerant and humble. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, however, being a nondevotee, was so polluted that he was even prepared to kill his own son. He justified this by putting forward the logic of amputation.</div>

<div class="Translation">Even though a person who has no assets in pious activities performs some good deed, it will have no result. Thus the weapons of the demons had no tangible effects upon Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja because he was a devotee undisturbed by material conditions and fully engaged in meditating upon and serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is unchangeable, who cannot be realized by the material senses, and who is the soul of the entire universe.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was constantly and fully engaged in thought of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As it is said, <span class="Italic">govinda-parirambhita&#7717;.</span> Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja engaged himself always in meditation, and thus he was protected by Govinda. Just as a small child on the lap of his father or mother is fully protected, a devotee, in all conditions, is protected by the Supreme Lord. Does this mean that when Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was attacked by the demons, the R&#257;k&#7779;asas, Govinda was also attacked by the demons? This is not possible. There have been many attempts by the demons to hurt or kill the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but He cannot be injured by any material means because He is always in transcendence. Therefore the words <span class="Italic">pare brahma&#7751;i</span> are used here. The demons, the R&#257;k&#7779;asas, can neither see nor touch the Supreme Lord, although they may superficially think that they are striking the Lord&rsquo;s transcendental body with their material weapons. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is described in this verse as <span class="Italic">anirde&#347;ye.</span> We cannot understand Him to be in a particular place, for He is all-pervasive. Moreover, He is <span class="Italic">akhil&#257;tm&#257;,</span> the active principle of everything, even material weapons. Those who cannot understand the position of the Lord are unfortunate. They may think that they can kill the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotee, but all their attempts will be futile. The Lord knows how to deal with them.</div>

The word <span class="Italic">dharma</span> here does not refer to some religious faith.

The other students were very much advanced in enjoying materialistic life through religion, economic development and sense gratification, but Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja laughed at them, knowing that this was not actual happiness, for real happiness is advancement in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. The duty of those who follow in the footsteps of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja is to teach the entire world how to be K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious and thus be really happy. Materialistic persons take to so-called religion to get some blessings so that they can improve their economic position and enjoy the material world through sense gratification. But devotees like Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja laugh at how foolish they are to be busy in a temporary life without knowledge of the soul&rsquo;s transmigration from one body to another. Materialistic persons are engaged in striving for temporary benefits, whereas persons advanced in spiritual knowledge, such as Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, are not interested in the materialistic way of life.

In speaking to his friends, who were all sons of demons, Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja stressed that every living entity, especially in human society, must be interested in spiritual realization from the very beginning of life. When human beings are children, they should be taught that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the worshipable Deity for everyone. One should not be very much interested in material enjoyment; instead, one should be satisfied with whatever material profits are easily obtainable, and because the duration of one&rsquo;s life is very short, one should utilize every moment for spiritual advancement. One may wrongly think, &ldquo;In the beginning of our lives let us enjoy material facilities, and in old age we may become K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious.&rdquo; Such materialistic thoughts are always useless because in old age one cannot be trained in the spiritual way of life. Therefore, from the very beginning of life, one should engage in devotional service (<span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;a&#7745; k&#299;rtana&#7745; vi&#7779;&#7751;o&#7717; </I>[SB </span></I><a href="indexda76.html?g=55355">7.5.23</a>]). This is the duty of all living entities. Material education is infected by the three modes of nature, but spiritual education, for which there is a great need in human society, is transcendental. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja disclosed the secret of how he had received instructions from N&#257;rada Muni. By accepting the lotus feet of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, who is in the <span class="Italic">parampar&#257;</span> succession, one will be able to understand the mode of spiritual life.

<div class="Translation">Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja said: One who is sufficiently intelligent should use the human form of body from the very beginning of life&mdash;in other words, from the tender age of childhood&mdash;to practice the activities of devotional service, giving up all other engagements. The human body is most rarely achieved, and although temporary like other bodies, it is meaningful because in human life one can perform devotional service. Even a slight amount of sincere devotional service can give one complete perfection.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The whole purpose of Vedic civilization and of reading the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is to attain the perfect stage of devotional service in the human form of life. According to the Vedic system, therefore, from the very beginning of life the <span class="Italic">brahmacarya</span> system is introduced so that from one&rsquo;s very childhood&mdash;from the age of five years&mdash;one can practice modifying one&rsquo;s human activities so as to engage perfectly in devotional service. As confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index5584.html?g=745">2.40</a>), <span class="Italic">svalpam apy asya dharmasya tr&#257;yate mahato bhay&#257;t:</span> &ldquo;Even a little advancement on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear.&rdquo; Modern civilization, not referring to the verdicts of Vedic literature, is so cruel to the members of human society that instead of teaching children to become <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;s,</span> it teaches mothers to kill their children even in the womb, on the plea of curbing the increase of population. And if by chance a child is saved, he is educated only for sense gratification. Gradually, throughout the entire world, human society is losing interest in the perfection of life. Indeed, men are living like cats and dogs, spoiling the duration of their human lives by actually preparing to transmigrate again to the degraded species among the 8,400,000 forms of life. The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is anxious to serve human society by teaching people to perform devotional service, which can save a human being from being degraded again to animal life.

For this transcendental happiness, the living entity has wandered throughout the universe in different forms of life and different planetary systems, but because he has forgotten his intimate relationship with Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, he has merely suffered, life after life. Therefore, the educational system in the human form of life should be so perfect that one will understand his intimate relationship with God, or Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Every living entity has an intimate relationship with God. One should therefore glorify the Lord in the adoration of <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;nta-rasa</span> or revive his eternal relationship with Vi&#7779;&#7751;u as a servant in <span class="Italic">d&#257;sya-rasa,</span> a friend in <span class="Italic">sakhya-rasa,</span> a parent in <span class="Italic">v&#257;tsalya-rasa</span> or a conjugal lover in <span class="Italic">m&#257;dhurya-rasa.</span> All these relationships are on the platform of love. Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is the center of love for everyone, and therefore the duty of everyone is to engage in the loving service of the Lord.

Such happiness is automatically obtained without endeavor, just as we obtain distress.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the material world, in any form of life, there is some so-called happiness and so-called distress. No one invites distress in order to suffer, but still it comes. Similarly, even if we do not endeavor to obtain the advantages of material happiness, we shall obtain them automatically. This happiness and distress are obtainable in any form of life, without endeavor. Thus there is no need to waste time and energy fighting against distress or working very hard for happiness. Our only business in the human form of life should be to revive our relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus become qualified to return home, back to Godhead. Material happiness and distress come as soon as we accept a material body, regardless of what form. We cannot avoid such happiness and distress under any circumstances. The best use of human life, therefore, lies in reviving our relationship with the Supreme Lord, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u.</div>

Nor do they know what the real problem of life is. This is due to a lack of spiritual education. Especially in the present age, every man is in darkness, in the bodily conception of life, not knowing anything of the spirit soul and its needs. Misguided by the blind leaders of society, people consider the body to be everything, and they are engaged in trying to keep the body materially comfortable. Such a civilization is condemned because it does not lead humanity toward knowing the real goal of life. People are simply wasting time and the valuable gift of the human form because a human being who does not cultivate spiritual life but dies like the cats and dogs is degraded in his next life. From human life, such a person is put into the cycle of continuous birth and death. Thus one loses the true benefit of human life, which is to become K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious and solve life&rsquo;s problems.</div>

Materialistic life is full of anxieties and fear (<span class="Italic">bhayam</span>). Similarly, accepting the reading <span class="Italic">bhavam &#257;&#347;rita&#7717;,</span> the word <span class="Italic">bhavam</span> refers to unnecessary trouble and problems. For want of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, one is put into <span class="Italic">bhavam,</span> being perpetually embarrassed by birth, death, old age and disease. Thus one is surely full of anxieties.</div>

A sane man, therefore, is always fearful of falling from his position. This is a regulative principle. One should not fall from his exalted position. The highest goal of life can be achieved as long as one&rsquo;s body is stout and strong. We should therefore live in such a way that we keep ourselves always healthy and strong in mind and intelligence so that we can distinguish the goal of life from a life full of problems. A thoughtful man must act in this way, learning to distinguish right from wrong, and thus attain the goal of life.</div>

<div class="First">Lord Brahm&#257;, a human being and an ant all live for one hundred years, but their lifetimes of one hundred years are different from one another. This world is a relative world, and its relative moments of time are different. Thus the one hundred years of Brahm&#257; are not the same as the one hundred years of a human being. From <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> we times 1,000 years (<span class="Italic">sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahma&#7751;o vidu&#7717;</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index4a77.html?g=2886">8.17</a>]). Thus the <span class="Italic">var&#7779;a-&#347;atam,</span> or one hundred years, are relatively different according to time, person and circumstances. As far as human beings are concerned, the calculation given here is right for the general public. Although one has a maximum of one hundred years of life, by sleeping one loses fifty years. Eating, sleeping, sex life and fear are the four bodily necessities, but to utilize the full duration of life a person desiring to advance in spiritual consciousness must reduce these activities.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This is the account of one hundred years of life. Although in this age a lifetime of one hundred years is generally not possible, even if one has one hundred years, the calculation is that fifty years are wasted in sleeping, twenty years in childhood and boyhood, and twenty years in invalidity (<span class="Italic">jar&#257;-vy&#257;dhi</span>). This leaves only a few more years, but because of too much attachment to household life, those years are also spent with no purpose, without God consciousness. Therefore, one should be trained to be a perfect <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> in the beginning of life and then to be perfect in sense control, following the regulative principles, if one becomes a householder. From household life one is ordered to accept <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha</span> life and go to the forest and then accept <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa.</span> That is the perfection of life. From the very beginning of life, those who are <span class="Italic">ajitendriya,</span> who cannot control their senses, are educated only for sense gratification, as we have seen in the Western countries.

For this purpose K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a personally advises, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharm&#257;n parityajya m&#257;m eka&#7745; &#347;ara&#7751;a&#7745; vraja:</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="index3a32.html?g=5997">18.66</a>] &ldquo;Give up all other duties and surrender unto Me.&rdquo; While in the material world we manufacture so many duties in the name of so many isms, but our actual duty is to free ourselves from the cycle of birth, death, old age and disease. For this purpose, one must first be liberated from material bondage, and especially from household life. Household life is actually a kind of license for a materially attached person by which to enjoy sense gratification under regulative principles. Otherwise there is no need of entering household life.</div>
<div class="Purport">Before entering household life, one should be trained as a <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;,</span> living under the care of the <span class="Italic">guru,</span> whose place is known as the <span class="Italic">guru-kula.</span> <span class="Italic">Brahmac&#257;r&#299; guru-kule vasan d&#257;nto guror hitam</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="index0fc2.html?g=58216">7.12.1</a>). From the very beginning, a <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> is trained to sacrifice everything for the benefit of the <span class="Italic">guru.</span> A <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> is advised to go begging alms door to door, addressing all women as mother, and whatever he collects goes to the benefit of the <span class="Italic">guru.</span> In this way he learns how to control his senses and sacrifice everything for the <span class="Italic">guru.</span> When he is fully trained, if he likes he is allowed to marry. Thus he is not an ordinary <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> who has learned only how to satisfy his senses. A trained <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> can gradually give up household life and go to the forest to become increasingly enlightened in spiritual life and at last take <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa.</span> Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja explained to his father that to be freed from all material anxieties one should go to the forest. <span class="Italic">Hitv&#257;tma-p&#257;ta&#7745; g&#7771;ham andha-k&#363;pam.</span> One should give up his household, which is a place for going further and further down into the darkest regions of material existence. The first advice, therefore, is that one must give up household life (<span class="Italic">g&#7771;ham andha-k&#363;pam</span>). However, if one prefers to remain in the dark well of household life because of uncontrolled senses, he becomes increasingly entangled by ropes of affection for his wife, children, servants, house, money and so on. Such a person cannot attain liberation from material bondage. Therefore children should be taught from the very beginning of life to be first-class <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;s.</span> Then it will be possible for them to give up household life in the future.</div>
<div class="Purport">To return home, back to Godhead, one must be completely free from material attachment. Therefore, <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> means <span class="Italic">vair&#257;gya-vidy&#257;,</span> the art that can help one develop a distaste for material enjoyment.</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">v&#257;sudeve bhagavati<br>bhakti-yoga&#7717; prayojita&#7717;<br>janayaty &#257;&#347;u vair&#257;gya&#7745;<br>j&ntilde;&#257;na&#7745; ca yad ahaitukam</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;By rendering devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead, &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, one immediately acquires causeless knowledge and detachment from the world.&rdquo; (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="indexbe51.html?g=6388">1.2.7</a>) If one engages in devotional service from the beginning of life, he easily attains <span class="Italic">vair&#257;gya-vidy&#257;,</span> or <span class="Italic">asakti,</span> detachment, and becomes <span class="Italic">jitendriya,</span> the controller of his senses. One who perfectly engages in devotional service is therefore called <span class="Italic">gosv&#257;m&#299;</span> or <span class="Italic">sv&#257;m&#299;,</span> master of the senses. Unless one is master of the senses, he should not accept the renounced order of life, <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa.</span> A strong inclination for sense enjoyment is the cause of the material body. Without full knowledge one cannot be unattached to material enjoyment, but as long as one is not in that position one is not fit to return home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Money is so dear that one conceives of money as being sweeter than honey. Therefore, who can give up the desire to accumulate money, especially in household life? Thieves, professional servants [soldiers] and merchants try to acquire money even by risking their very dear lives.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">How money can be dearer than life is indicated in this verse. Thieves may enter the house of a rich man to steal money at the risk of their lives. Because of trespassing, they may be killed by guns or attacked by watchdogs, but still they try to commit burglary. Why do they risk their lives? Only to get some money. Similarly, a professional soldier is recruited into the army, and he accepts such service, with the risk of dying on the battlefield, only for the sake of money. In the same way, merchants go from one country to another on boats at the risk of their lives, or they dive into the water of the sea to collect pearls and valuable gems. Thus it is practically proved&mdash;and everyone will admit&mdash;that money is sweeter than honey. One may risk everything to acquire money, and this is especially true of rich men who are too attached to household life. Formerly, of course, the members of the higher castes&mdash;the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as, k&#7779;atriyas</span> and <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas</span> (everyone but the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span>)&mdash;were trained in the <span class="Italic">guru-kula</span> to adhere to a life of renunciation and sense control by practicing <span class="Italic">brahmacarya</span> and mystic <span class="Italic">yoga.</span> Then they were allowed to enter household life. There have consequently been many instances in which great kings and emperors have given up household life. Although they were extremely opulent and were the masters of kingdoms, they could give up all their possessions because they were trained early as <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;s.</span> Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s advice is therefore very appropriate:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">kaum&#257;ra &#257;caret pr&#257;j&ntilde;o<br>dharm&#257;n bh&#257;gavat&#257;n iha<br>durlabha&#7745; m&#257;nu&#7779;a&#7745; janma<br>tad apy adhruvam arthadam<br><span class="Italic"> </I>[SB </span></I><a href="indexc835.html?g=55645">7.6.1</a></I>]</I></div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;One who is sufficiently intelligent should use the human form of body from the very beginning of life&mdash;in other words, from the tender age of childhood&mdash;to practice the activities of devotional service, giving up all other engagements. The human body is most rarely achieved, and although temporary like other bodies, it is meaningful because in human life one can perform devotional service. Even a slight amount of sincere devotional service can give one complete perfection.&rdquo; Human society should take advantage of this instruction.</div>

<div class="Translation">How can a person who is most affectionate to his family, the core of his heart being always filled with their pictures, give up their association? Specifically, a wife is always very kind and sympathetic and always pleases her husband in a solitary place. Who could give up the association of such a dear and affectionate wife? Small children talk in broken language, very pleasing to hear, and their affectionate father always thinks of their sweet words. How could he give up their association? One&rsquo;s elderly parents and one&rsquo;s sons and daughters are also very dear. A daughter is especially dear to her father, and while living at her husband&rsquo;s house she is always in his mind. Who could give up that association? Aside from this, in household affairs there are many decorated items of household furniture, and there are also animals and servants. Who could give up such comforts? The attached householder is like a silkworm, which weaves a cocoon in which it becomes imprisoned, unable to get out. Simply for the satisfaction of two important senses&mdash;the genitals and the tongue&mdash;one is bound by material conditions. How can one escape?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In household affairs the first attraction is the beautiful and pleasing wife, who increases household attraction more and more. One enjoys his wife with two prominent sense organs, namely the tongue and the genitals. The wife speaks very sweetly. This is certainly an attraction. Then she prepares very palatable foods to satisfy the tongue, and when the tongue is satisfied one gains strength in the other sense organs, especially the genitals. Thus the wife gives pleasure in sexual intercourse. Household life means sex life (<span class="Italic">yan maithun&#257;di-g&#7771;hamedhi-sukha&#7745; hi tuccham</I> [SB </span></I><a href="indexaa4a.html?g=57238">7.9.45</a>]). This is encouraged by the tongue. Then there are children. A baby gives pleasure by speaking sweet words in broken language, and when the sons and daughters are grown up one becomes involved in their education and marriage. Then there are one&rsquo;s own father and mother to be taken care of, and one also becomes concerned with the social atmosphere and with pleasing his brothers and sisters. A man becomes increasingly entangled in household affairs, so much so that leaving them becomes almost impossible. Thus the household becomes <span class="Italic">g&#7771;ham andha-k&#363;pam,</span> a dark well into which the man has fallen. For such a man to get out is extremely difficult unless he is helped by a strong person, the spiritual master, who helps the fallen person with the strong rope of spiritual instructions. A fallen person should take advantage of this rope, and then the spiritual master, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, will take him out of the dark well.</div>

Although he knows that one who takes the wealth of others will be punished by the law of the government, and by the laws of Yamar&#257;ja after death, he continues cheating others to acquire money.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Especially in these days, people do not believe in a next life or in the court of Yamar&#257;ja and the various punishments of the sinful. But at least one should know that one who cheats others to acquire money will be punished by the laws of the government. Nonetheless, people do not care about the laws of this life or those governing the next. Despite whatever knowledge one has, one cannot stop his sinful activities if he is unable to control his senses.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">O my friends, sons of demons! In this material world, even those who are apparently advanced in education have the propensity to consider, &ldquo;This is mine, and that is for others.&rdquo; Thus they are always engaged in providing the necessities of life to their families in a limited conception of family life, just like uneducated cats and dogs. They are unable to take to spiritual knowledge; instead, they are bewildered and overcome by ignorance.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In human society there are attempts to educate the human being, but for animal society there is no such system, nor are animals able to be educated. Therefore animals and unintelligent men are called <span class="Italic">vim&#363;&#7693;ha,</span> or ignorant, bewildered, whereas an educated person is called <span class="Italic">vidv&#257;n.</span> The real <span class="Italic">vidv&#257;n</span> is one who tries to understand his own position within this material world. For example, when San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299; submitted to the lotus feet of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, his first question was <span class="Italic">&lsquo;ke &#257;mi&rsquo;, &lsquo;kene &#257;m&#257;ya j&#257;re t&#257;pa-traya&rsquo;.</span> In other words, he wanted to know his constitutional position and why he was suffering from the threefold miseries of material existence. This is the process of education. If one does not ask, &ldquo;Who am I? What is the goal of my life?&rdquo; but instead follows the same animal propensities as cats and dogs, what is the use of his education? As discussed in the previous verse, a living being is entrapped by his fruitive activities, exactly like a silkworm trapped in its own cocoon. Foolish persons are generally encaged by their fruitive actions (<span class="Italic">karma</span>) because of a strong desire to enjoy this material world. Such attracted persons become involved in society, community and nation and waste their time, not having profited from having obtained human forms. Especially in this age, Kali-yuga, great leaders, politicians, philosophers and scientists are all engaged in foolish activities, thinking, &ldquo;This is mine, and this is yours.&rdquo; The scientists invent nuclear weapons and collaborate with the big leaders to protect the interests of their own nation or society. In this verse, however, it is clearly stated that despite their so-called advanced knowledge, they actually have the same mentality as cats and dogs. As cats, dogs and other animals, not knowing their true interest in life, become increasingly involved in ignorance, the so-called educated person who does not know his own self-interest or the true goal of life becomes increasingly involved in materialism. Therefore Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja advises everyone to follow the principles of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma.</span> Specifically, at a certain point one must give up family life and take to the renounced order of life to cultivate spiritual knowledge and thus become liberated. This is further discussed in the following verses.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">My dear friends, O sons of the demons, it is certain that no one bereft of knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead has been able to liberate himself from material bondage at any time or in any country. Rather, those bereft of knowledge of the Lord are bound by the material laws. They are factually addicted to sense gratification, and their target is woman. Indeed, they are actually playthings in the hands of attractive women. Victimized by such a conception of life, they become surrounded by children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and thus they are shackled to material bondage. Those who are very much addicted to this conception of life are called demons. Therefore, although you are sons of demons, keep aloof from such persons and take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, the origin of all the demigods, because the ultimate goal for the devotees of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a is liberation from the bondage of material existence.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja has maintained the philosophical point of view that one should give up the dark well of family life and go to the forest to take shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (<span class="Italic">hitv&#257;tma-p&#257;ta&#7745; g&#7771;ham andha-k&#363;pa&#7745; vana&#7745; gato yad dharim &#257;&#347;rayeta</I> [SB </span></I><a href="indexd2be.html?g=55189">7.5.5</a>]). In this verse also, he stresses the same point. In the history of human society, no one, at any time or any place, has been liberated because of too much affection and attachment for his family. Even in those who are apparently very educated, the same family attachment is there. They cannot give up the association of their families, even in old age or invalidity, for they are attached to sense enjoyment. As we have several times discussed, <span class="Italic">yan maithun&#257;di-g&#7771;hamedhi-sukha&#7745; hi tuccham:</I> [SB </span></I><a href="indexaa4a.html?g=57238">7.9.45</a>] so-called householders are simply attracted by sexual enjoyment. Thus they keep themselves shackled in family life, and furthermore they want their children to be shackled in the same way. Playing the parts of playboys in the hands of women, they glide down to the darkest regions of material existence. <span class="Italic">Ad&#257;nta-gobhir vi&#347;at&#257;&#7745; tamisra&#7745; puna&#7717; puna&#347; carvita-carva&#7751;&#257;n&#257;m</I> [SB </span></I><a href="index24fb.html?g=55414">7.5.30</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> Because they are unable to control their senses, they continue a life of chewing the chewed and therefore descend to the darkest material regions. One should give up the association of such demons and adhere to the association of devotees. Thus one will be able to be liberated from material bondage.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">My dear sons of demons, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, is the original Supersoul, the father of all living entities. Consequently there are no impediments to pleasing Him or worshiping Him under any conditions, whether one be a child or an old man. The relationship between the living entities and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always a fact, and therefore there is no difficulty in pleasing the Lord.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">One may ask, &ldquo;One is certainly very attached to family life, but if one gives up family life to be attached to the service of the Lord, one must undergo the same endeavor and trouble. Therefore, what is the benefit of taking the trouble to engage in the service of the Lord?&rdquo; This is not a valid objection. The Lord asserts in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexf156.html?g=4632">14.4</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">sarva-yoni&#7779;u kaunteya<br>m&#363;rtaya&#7717; sambhavanti y&#257;&#7717;<br>t&#257;s&#257;&#7745; brahma mahad yonir<br>aha&#7745; b&#299;ja-prada&#7717; pit&#257;</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;It should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kunt&#299;, are made possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father.&rdquo; The Supreme Lord, N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, is the seed-giving father of all living entities because the living entities are parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord (<span class="Italic">mamaiv&#257;&#7745;&#347;o.</span> <span class="Italic">.. j&#299;va-bh&#363;ta&#7717;</span><I> </I>[15.7]). As there is no difficulty in establishing the intimate relationship between a father and son, there is no difficulty in reestablishing the natural, intimate relationship between N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a and the living entities. <span class="Italic">Svalpam apy asya dharmasya tr&#257;yate mahato bhay&#257;t:</span> if one performs even very slight devotional service, N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a is always ready to save one from the greatest danger. The definite example is Aj&#257;mila. Aj&#257;mila separated himself from the Supreme Personality of Godhead by performing many sinful activities and was condemned by Yamar&#257;ja to be very severely punished, but because at the time of death he chanted the name of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, although he was calling not for the Supreme Lord N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a but for his son named N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, he was saved from the hands of Yamar&#257;ja. Therefore, pleasing N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a does not require as much endeavor as pleasing one&rsquo;s family, community and nation. We have seen important political leaders killed for a slight discrepancy in their behavior. Therefore pleasing one&rsquo;s society, family, community and nation is extremely difficult. Pleasing N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, however, is not at all difficult; it is very easy.</div>
<div class="Purport">One&rsquo;s duty is to revive one&rsquo;s relationship with N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. A slight endeavor in this direction will make the attempt successful, whereas one will never be successful in pleasing his so-called family, society and nation, even if one endeavors to sacrifice his life. The simple endeavor involved in the devotional service of <span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;a&#7745; k&#299;rtana&#7745; vi&#7779;&#7751;o&#7717; </I>[SB </span></I><a href="indexda76.html?g=55355">7.5.23</a>]<span class="Italic">,</span> hearing and chanting the holy name of the Lord, can make one successful in pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu has therefore bestowed His blessings by saying, <span class="Italic">para&#7745; vijayate &#347;r&#299;-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-sa&#7749;k&#299;rtanam:</span> &ldquo;All glories to &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana!</span>&rdquo; If one wants to derive the actual benefit from this human form, he must take to the chanting of the holy name of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the supreme controller, who is infallible and indefatigable, is present in different forms of life, from the inert living beings [sth&#257;vara], such as the plants, to Brahm&#257;, the foremost created living being. He is also present in the varieties of material creations and in the material elements, the total material energy and the modes of material nature [sattva-gu&#7751;a, rajo-gu&#7751;a and tamo-gu&#7751;a], as well as the unmanifested material nature and the false ego. Although He is one, He is present everywhere, and He is also the transcendental Supersoul, the cause of all causes, who is present as the observer in the cores of the hearts of all living entities. He is indicated as that which is pervaded and as the all-pervading Supersoul, but actually He cannot be indicated. He is changeless and undivided. He is simply perceived as the supreme sac-cid-&#257;nanda [eternity, knowledge and bliss]. Being covered by the curtain of the external energy, to the atheist He appears nonexistent.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Not only is the Supreme Personality of Godhead present as the Supersoul of all living entities; at the same time, He pervades everything in the entire creation. He exists in all circumstances and at all times. He exists in the heart of Lord Brahm&#257; and also in the cores of the hearts of the hogs, dogs, trees, plants and so on. He is present everywhere. He is present not only in the heart of the living entity, but also in material things, even in the atoms, protons and electrons being explored by material scientists.</div>
<div class="Purport">The Lord is present in three features&mdash;as Brahman, Param&#257;tm&#257; and Bhagav&#257;n. Because He is present everywhere, He is described as <span class="Italic">sarva&#7745; khalv ida&#7745; brahma.</span> Vi&#7779;&#7751;u exists beyond Brahman. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> confirms that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, by His Brahman feature, is all-pervading (<span class="Italic">may&#257; tatam ida&#7745; sarvam</span>), but Brahman depends upon K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (<span class="Italic">brahma&#7751;o hi prati&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;ham</I>[Bg. </I></span><a href="index3746.html?g=4826">14.27</a></I><span class="Italic">]</I></span>). Without K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, there could be no existence of Brahman or Param&#257;tm&#257;. Therefore, Bhagav&#257;n, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the ultimate realization of the Absolute Truth. Although He is present as the Param&#257;tm&#257; in the core of everyone&rsquo;s heart, He is nonetheless one, either as an individual or as the all-pervading Brahman.</div>
<div class="Purport">The supreme cause is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and devotees who have surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead can realize Him and His presence within the universe and within the atom (<span class="Italic">a&#7751;&#7693;&#257;ntara-stha-param&#257;&#7751;u-cay&#257;ntara-stham</span>). This realization is possible only for devotees who have fully surrendered unto the lotus feet of the Lord; for others it is not possible. This is confirmed by the Lord Himself in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexd990.html?g=2586">7.14</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">daiv&#299; hy e&#7779;&#257; gu&#7751;a-may&#299;<br>mama m&#257;y&#257; duratyay&#257;<br>m&#257;m eva ye prapadyante<br>m&#257;y&#257;m et&#257;&#7745; taranti te</div>
<div class="After-Verse">The process of surrender in a devotional attitude is accepted by a fortunate living being. After wandering through many varieties of life on many planetary systems, when one comes to the real understanding of the Absolute Truth by the grace of a devotee, one surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as confirmed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">bah&#363;n&#257;&#7745; janman&#257;m ante j&ntilde;&#257;nav&#257;n m&#257;&#7745; prapadyate</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index4112.html?g=2631">7.19</a>]).</div>
<div class="Purport">Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s class friends, who were born of Daitya families, thought that realizing the Absolute was extremely difficult. Indeed, we have experience that many, many people say this very thing. Actually, however, this is not so. The Absolute, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is most intimately related to all living entities. Therefore if one understands the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava philosophy, which explains how He is present everywhere and how He acts everywhere, to worship the Supreme Lord or to realize Him is not at all difficult. Realization of the Lord, however, is possible only in the association of devotees. Therefore &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, in His teachings to R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; said (Cc. <span class="Ref_Italic">Madhya</span> <a href="index9884.html?g=124149">19.151</a>):</div>

<div class="After-Verse">The living entity in the material condition wanders through many varieties of life and many varieties of circumstances, but if he comes in contact with a pure devotee and is intelligent enough to take instructions from the pure devotee regarding the process of devotional service, he can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the origin of Brahman and Param&#257;tm&#257;, without difficulty. In this regard, &#346;r&#299;la Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">antary&#257;m&#299; pratyag-&#257;tm&#257;<br>vy&#257;pta&#7717; k&#257;lo hari&#7717; sm&#7771;ta&#7717;<br>prak&#7771;ty&#257; tamas&#257;v&#7771;tatv&#257;t<br>harer ai&#347;varya&#7745; na j&ntilde;&#257;yate</div>
<div class="After-Verse">The Lord is present as <span class="Italic">antary&#257;m&#299;</span> in everyone&rsquo;s heart and is visible in the individual soul covered by a body. Indeed, He is everywhere at every time and every condition, but because He is covered by the curtain of material energy, to an ordinary person there appears to be no God.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexbf7d.html?g=5898">18.55</a>), <span class="Italic">bhakty&#257; m&#257;m abhij&#257;n&#257;ti y&#257;v&#257;n ya&#347; c&#257;smi tattvata&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service.&rdquo; Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja ultimately instructed his class friends, the sons of the demons, to accept the process of devotional service by preaching the science of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness to everyone. Preaching is the best service to the Lord. The Lord will immediately be extremely satisfied with one who engages in this service of preaching K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. This is confirmed by the Lord Himself in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexaa3c.html?g=6024">18.69</a>). <span class="Italic">Na ca tasm&#257;n manu&#7779;ye&#7779;u ka&#347;cin me priya-k&#7771;ttama&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;There is no servant in this world more dear to Me than he, nor will there ever be one more dear.&rdquo; If one sincerely tries his best to spread K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness by preaching the glories of the Lord and His supremacy, even if he is imperfectly educated, he becomes the dearmost servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> As one performs this service for humanity, without discrimination between friends and enemies, the Lord becomes satisfied, and the mission of one&rsquo;s life is fulfilled. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu therefore advised everyone to become a <span class="Italic">guru-</span>devotee and preach K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness (<span class="Italic">y&#257;re dekha, t&#257;re kaha &lsquo;k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;-upade&#347;a</I> [</span></I>Cc. <span class="Ref_Italic"></B></I>Madhya</span></B></I> <a href="index89c7.html?g=104673">7.128</a>]). That is the easiest way to realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By such preaching, the preacher becomes satisfied, and those to whom he preaches are also satisfied. This is the process of bringing peace and tranquillity to the entire world.</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">bhokt&#257;ra&#7745; yaj&ntilde;a-tapas&#257;&#7745;<br>sarva-loka-mahe&#347;varam<br>suh&#7771;da&#7745; sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;n&#257;&#7745;<br>j&ntilde;&#257;tv&#257; m&#257;&#7745; &#347;&#257;ntim &#7771;cchati<br></I><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index2ceb.html?g=2055">5.29</a></I>]</I></div>
<div class="After-Verse">One is expected to understand these three formulas of knowledge concerning the Supreme Lord&mdash;that He is the supreme enjoyer, that He is the proprietor of everything, and that He is the best well-wisher and friend of everyone. A preacher should personally understand these truths and preach them to everyone. Then there will be peace and tranquillity all over the world.</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">sauh&#7771;dam</span> (&ldquo;friendliness&rdquo;) is very significant in this verse. People are generally ignorant of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, and therefore to become their best well-wisher one should teach them about K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness without discrimination. Since the Supreme Lord, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, is situated in the core of everyone&rsquo;s heart, every body is a temple of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. One should not misuse this understanding as an excuse for such words as <span class="Italic">daridra-n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a.</span> If N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a lives in the house of a <span class="Italic">daridra,</span> a poor man, this does not mean that N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a becomes poor. He lives everywhere&mdash;in the houses of the poor and those of the rich&mdash;but in all circumstances He remains N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a; to think that He becomes either poor or rich is a material calculation.

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Religion, economic development and sense gratification&mdash;these are described in the Vedas as tri-varga, or three ways to salvation. Within these three categories are education and self-realization; ritualistic ceremonies performed according to Vedic injunction; logic; the science of law and order; and the various means of earning one&rsquo;s livelihood. These are the external subject matters of study in the Vedas, and therefore I consider them material. However, I consider surrender to the lotus feet of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u to be transcendental.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">These instructions of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja stress the transcendental position of devotional service. As confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexee26.html?g=4817">14.26</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">m&#257;&#7745; ca yo &rsquo;vyabhic&#257;re&#7751;a<br>bhakti-yogena sevate<br>sa gu&#7751;&#257;n samat&#299;tyait&#257;n<br>brahma-bh&#363;y&#257;ya kalpate</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.&rdquo; One who fully engages in the devotional service of the Lord is immediately raised to the transcendental position, which is the <span class="Italic">brahma-bh&#363;ta</span> stage. Any education or activity not on the <span class="Italic">brahma-bh&#363;ta</span> platform, the platform of self-realization, is considered to be material, and Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja says that anything material cannot be the Absolute Truth, for the Absolute Truth is on the spiritual platform. This is also confirmed by Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexa679.html?g=785">2.45</a>), where He says, <span class="Italic">traigu&#7751;ya-vi&#7779;ay&#257; ved&#257; nistraigu&#7751;yo bhav&#257;rjuna:</span> &ldquo;The Vedas mainly deal with the subject of the three modes of material nature. Rise above these modes, O Arjuna. Be transcendental to all of them.&rdquo; To act on the material platform, even if one&rsquo;s activities are sanctioned by the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> is not the ultimate goal of life. The ultimate goal of life is to stay on the spiritual platform, fully surrendered to the <span class="Italic">parama-puru&#7779;a,</span> the supreme person. This is the object of the human mission. In summary, the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies and injunctions are not to be discounted; they are means of being promoted to the spiritual platform. But if one does not come to the spiritual platform, the Vedic ceremonies are simply a waste of time. This is confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="index12a8.html?g=6397">1.2.8</a>):</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Duties [<span class="Italic">dharma</span>] executed by men, regardless of occupation, are only so much useless labor if they do not provoke attraction for the message of the Supreme Lord.&rdquo; If one very strictly performs the various duties of religion but does not ultimately come to the platform of surrendering to the Supreme Lord, his methods of attaining salvation or elevation are simply a waste of time and energy.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">When Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu left his kingdom and went to the mountain known as Mandar&#257;cala to execute severe austerities, all the demons scattered. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu&rsquo;s wife, Kay&#257;dhu, was pregnant at that time, and the demigods, mistakenly thinking that she carried another demon in her womb, arrested her. Their plan was that as soon as the child took birth they would kill him. While they were taking Kay&#257;dhu to the heavenly planets, they met N&#257;rada Muni, who stopped them from taking her away and took her to his <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama</span> until Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu&rsquo;s return. In N&#257;rada Muni&rsquo;s <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama,</span> Kay&#257;dhu prayed for the protection of the baby in her womb, and N&#257;rada Muni reassured her and gave her instructions on spiritual knowledge. Taking advantage of those instructions, Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, although a small baby within the womb, listened very carefully. The spirit soul is always apart from the material body. There is no change in the spiritual form of the living entity. Any person above the bodily conception of life is pure and can receive transcendental knowledge. This transcendental knowledge is devotional service, and Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, while living in the womb of his mother, received instructions in devotional service from N&#257;rada Muni. Any person engaged in the service of the Lord through the instructions of a bona fide spiritual master is immediately liberated, and being free from the clutches of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> he is relieved of all ignorance and material desires. The duty of everyone is to take shelter of the Supreme Lord and thus become free from all material desires. Regardless of the material condition in which one is situated, one can achieve this perfection. Devotional service is not dependent on the material activities of austerity, penance, mystic <span class="Italic">yoga</span> or piety. Even without such assets, one can achieve devotional service through the mercy of a pure devotee.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">One should not remain in a secluded place with a woman, even one&rsquo;s mother, sister, or daughter. Nonetheless, although one is strictly prohibited from staying with a woman in a secluded place, N&#257;rada Muni gave shelter to Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s young mother, who rendered service to him with great devotion and faith. Does this mean that N&#257;rada Muni transgressed the Vedic injunctions? Certainly he did not. Such injunctions are intended for mundane creatures, but N&#257;rada Muni is transcendental to mundane categories. N&#257;rada Muni is a great saint and is transcendentally situated. Therefore, although he was a young man, he could give shelter to a young woman and accept her service. Harid&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura also spoke with a young woman, a prostitute, in the dead of night, but the woman could not deviate his mind. Instead, she became a Vai&#7779;&#7751;av&#299;, a pure devotee, by the benediction of Harid&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura. Ordinary persons, however, should not imitate such highly elevated devotees. Ordinary persons must strictly observe the rules and regulations by staying aloof from the association of women. No one should imitate N&#257;rada Muni or Harid&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura. It is said, <span class="Italic">vai&#7779;&#7751;avera kriy&#257;-mudr&#257; vij&ntilde;e n&#257; bujhaya.</span> Even if a man is very advanced in learning, he cannot understand the behavior of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. Anyone can take shelter of a pure Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, without fear. Therefore in the previous verse it has been distinctly said, <span class="Italic">devar&#7779;er antike s&#257;kuto-bhay&#257;:</span> Kay&#257;dhu, the mother of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, stayed under the protection of N&#257;rada Muni without fear from any direction. Similarly, N&#257;rada Muni, in his transcendental position, stayed with the young woman without fear of deviation. N&#257;rada Muni, Harid&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura and similar <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> especially empowered to broadcast the glories of the Lord cannot be brought down to the material platform. Therefore one is strictly forbidden to think that the <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya</span> is an ordinary human being (<span class="Italic">guru&#7779;u nara-mati&#7717;</span>).</div>

<div class="Purport">These are Vedic instructions. One must have full faith in the words of the spiritual master and similar faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then the real knowledge of <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;</span> and Param&#257;tm&#257; and the distinction between matter and spirit will be automatically revealed. This <span class="Italic">&#257;tma-tattva,</span> or spiritual knowledge, will be revealed within the core of a devotee&rsquo;s heart because of his having taken shelter of the lotus feet of a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;jana</span> such as Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja.</div>
<div class="Purport">In this verse the word <span class="Italic">bh&#363;y&#257;t</span> may be understood to mean &ldquo;let there be.&rdquo; Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja offers his blessings to his class friends, saying, &ldquo;Also become faithful like me. Become bona fide Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas.&rdquo; A devotee of the Lord desires for everyone to take to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. Unfortunately, however, people sometimes do not have staunch faith in the words of the spiritual master who comes by the disciplic succession, and therefore they are unable to understand transcendental knowledge. The spiritual master must be in the line of authorized disciplic succession, like Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, who received the knowledge from N&#257;rada. If the class friends of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, the sons of demons, were to accept the truth through Prahl&#257;da, they would certainly also become fully aware of transcendental knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purport">The words <span class="Italic">vai&#347;&#257;rad&#299; dh&#299;&#7717;</span> refer to intelligence concerning the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is extremely expert. The Lord has created wonderful universes by His expert knowledge. Unless one is extremely expert, he cannot understand the expert management of the supreme expert. One can understand, however, if one is fortunate enough to meet a bona fide spiritual master coming in the disciplic succession from Lord Brahm&#257;, Lord &#346;iva, Mother Lak&#7779;m&#299; or the Kum&#257;ras. These four <span class="Italic">samprad&#257;yas,</span> or disciplic successions of knowledge and transcendence, are called the Brahma-samprad&#257;ya, Rudra-samprad&#257;ya, &#346;r&#299;-samprad&#257;ya, and Kum&#257;ra-samprad&#257;ya. <span class="Italic">Samprad&#257;ya-vih&#299;n&#257; ye mantr&#257;s te ni&#7779;phal&#257; mat&#257;&#7717;.</span> The knowledge of the Supreme received from such a <span class="Italic">samprad&#257;ya,</span> or disciplic succession, can give one enlightenment. If one does not take to the path of disciplic succession, it is not possible for one to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one understands the Supreme Lord through devotional service with faith in the disciplic succession and then advances further, he awakens his natural love for God, and then his success in life is assured.</div>

<div class="Translation">Just as the fruits and flowers of a tree in due course of time undergo six changes&mdash;birth, existence, growth, transformation, dwindling and then death&mdash;the material body, which is obtained by the spirit soul under different circumstances, undergoes similar changes. However, there are no such changes for the spirit soul.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This is a very important verse in understanding the difference between the spiritual soul and the material body. The soul is eternal, as stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexd7ba.html?g=565">2.20</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">na j&#257;yate mriyate v&#257; kad&#257;cin<br>n&#257;ya&#7745; bh&#363;tv&#257; bhavit&#257; v&#257; na bh&#363;ya&#7717;<br>ajo nitya&#7717; &#347;&#257;&#347;vato &rsquo;ya&#7745; pur&#257;&#7751;o<br>na hanyate hanyam&#257;ne &#347;ar&#299;re</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;For the soul there is never birth nor death. Nor, having once been, does he ever cease to be. He is unborn, eternal, ever-existing, undying and primeval. He is not slain when the body is slain.&rdquo; The spirit soul is eternal, being freed from waste and change, which take place because of the material body. The example of a tree and its fruits and flowers is very simple and clear. A tree stands for many, many years, but with the seasonal changes its fruits and flowers undergo six transformations. The foolish theory of modern chemists that life can be produced by chemical interactions cannot be accepted as truth. The birth of a human being&rsquo;s material body takes place due to a mixture of the ovum and semen, but the history of birth is that although the ovum and semen mix together after sex, there is not always pregnancy. Unless the soul enters the mixture, there is no possibility of pregnancy, but when the soul takes shelter of the mixture the body takes birth, exists, grows, transforms and dwindles, and ultimately it is vanquished. The fruits and flowers of a tree seasonally come and go, but the tree continues to stand. Similarly, the transmigrating soul accepts various bodies, which undergo six transformations, but the soul remains permanently the same (<span class="Italic">ajo nitya&#7717; &#347;&#257;&#347;vato &rsquo;ya&#7745; pur&#257;&#7751;o na hanyate hanyam&#257;ne &#347;ar&#299;re</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="indexd7ba.html?g=565">2.20</a></I>]</I>). The soul is eternal and ever existing, but the bodies accepted by the soul are changing.</div>
<div class="Purport">There are two kinds of soul&mdash;the Supreme Soul (the Personality of Godhead) and the individual soul (the living entity). As various bodily changes take place in the individual soul, different millenniums of creation take place in the Supreme Soul. In this regard, Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">&#7779;a&#7693; vik&#257;r&#257;&#7717; &#347;ar&#299;rasya<br>na vi&#7779;&#7751;os tad-gatasya<br>ca tad-adh&#299;na&#7745; &#347;ar&#299;ra&#7745; ca<br>j&ntilde;&#257;tv&#257; tan mamat&#257;&#7745; tyajet</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Since the body is the external feature of the soul, the soul is not dependent on the body; rather, the body is dependent on the soul. One who understands this truth should not be very much anxious about the maintenance of his body. There is no possibility of maintaining the body permanently or eternally. <span class="Italic">Antavanta ime deh&#257; nityasyokt&#257;&#7717; &#347;ar&#299;ri&#7751;a&#7717;.</span> This is the statement of <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexdbe0.html?g=547">2.18</a>). The material body is <span class="Italic">antavat</span> (perishable), but the soul within the body is eternal (<span class="Italic">nityasyokt&#257;&#7717; &#347;ar&#299;ri&#7751;a&#7717;</span>). Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and the individual souls, who are part and parcel of Him, are both eternal. <span class="Italic">Nityo nity&#257;n&#257;&#7745; cetana&#347; cetan&#257;n&#257;m.</span> Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is the chief living being, whereas the individual living entities are parts of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. All the various grades of bodies&mdash;from the gigantic universal body to the small body of an ant&mdash;are perishable, but the Supersoul and the soul, being equal in quality, both exist eternally. This is further explained in the next verses.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">&ldquo;&#256;tm&#257;&rdquo; refers to the Supreme Lord or the living entities. Both of them are spiritual, free from birth and death, free from deterioration and free from material contamination. They are individual, they are the knowers of the external body, and they are the foundation or shelter of everything. They are free from material change, they are self-illuminated, they are the cause of all causes, and they are all-pervading. They have nothing to do with the material body, and therefore they are always uncovered. With these transcendental qualities, one who is actually learned must give up the illusory conception of life, in which one thinks, &ldquo;I am this material body, and everything in relationship with this body is mine.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index6669.html?g=4886">15.7</a>) Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a clearly says, <span class="Italic">mamaiv&#257;&#7745;&#347;o j&#299;va-loke j&#299;va-bh&#363;ta&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;All the living entities are part of Me.&rdquo; Therefore the living entities are qualitatively the same as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the leader, the Supreme among all the living entities. In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">nityo nity&#257;n&#257;&#7745; cetana&#347; cetan&#257;n&#257;m:</span> the Lord is the chief individual living entity, the leader of the subordinate living entities. Because the living entities are parts or samples of God, their qualities are not different from those of the Supreme Lord. The living entities have the same qualities as the Lord, just as a drop of sea water is composed of the same chemicals as the great sea itself. Thus there is oneness in quality but a difference in quantity. One can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by understanding the sample, the living entity, because all the qualities of God exist in a minute quantity in the living entities. There is oneness, but God is great whereas the living entities are extremely small. <span class="Italic">A&#7751;or a&#7751;&#299;y&#257;n mahato mah&#299;y&#257;n</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Ka&#7789;ha Upani&#7779;ad</span> 1.2.20). The living entities are smaller than the atom, but God is greater than the greatest. Our conception of greatness may be represented by the sky because we think of the sky as being unlimitedly big, but God is bigger than the sky. Similarly, we have knowledge that the living entities are smaller than atoms, being one ten-thousandth the size of the tip of a hair, yet the quality of being the supreme cause of all causes exists in the living entity as well as in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Indeed, it is due to the presence of the living entity that the body exists and bodily changes take place. Similarly, it is because the Supreme Lord is within this universe that the changes dictated by the material laws occur.</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">eka&#7717;,</span> meaning &ldquo;individual,&rdquo; is significant. As explained in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexa3fb.html?g=3021">9.4</a>), <span class="Italic">mat-sth&#257;ni sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;ni na c&#257;ha&#7745; te&#7779;v avasthita&#7717;.</span> Everything, material and spiritual, including earth, water, air, fire, sky and the living entities, exists on the platform of spirit soul. Although everything is an emanation from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one should not think that the Supreme Lord is dependent upon anything else.</div>
<div class="Purport">Both God and the living entity are fully conscious. As living entities, we are conscious of our bodily existence. Similarly, the Lord is conscious of the gigantic cosmic manifestation. This is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> <span class="Italic">Yasmin dyau&#7717; p&#7771;thiv&#299; c&#257;ntar&#299;k&#7779;am. Vij&ntilde;&#257;t&#257;ram adhikena vij&#257;n&#299;y&#257;t. Ekam ev&#257;dvit&#299;yam. &#256;tma-jyoti&#7717; samr&#257;&#7693; ihov&#257;ca. Sa im&#257;n lok&#257;n as&#7771;jata. Satya&#7745; j&ntilde;&#257;nam anantam. Asa&#7749;go hy aya&#7745; puru&#7779;a&#7717;. p&#363;r&#7751;asya p&#363;r&#7751;am &#257;d&#257;ya p&#363;r&#7751;am ev&#257;va&#347;i&#7779;yate.</span> All these Vedic injunctions prove that both the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the minute soul are individual. One is great, and the other is small, but both of them are the cause of all causes&mdash;the corporally limited and the universally unlimited.</div>
<div class="Purport">We should always remember that although we are equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in quality, we are never equal to Him in quantity. Persons with a small fund of intelligence, finding themselves equal in quality with God, foolishly think that they are equal in quantity also. Their intelligence is called <span class="Italic">avi&#347;uddha-buddhaya&#7717;</span>&mdash;unpolished or contaminated intelligence. When such persons, after endeavoring hard for many, many lives to understand the supreme cause, are finally in actual knowledge of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, V&#257;sudeva, they surrender unto Him (<span class="Italic">v&#257;sudeva&#7717; sarvam iti sa mah&#257;tm&#257; sudurlabha&#7717;</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index4112.html?g=2631">7.19</a>]). Thus they become great <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;s,</span> perfect souls. If one is fortunate enough to understand his relationship with God, knowing that God is great (<span class="Italic">vibhu</span>) whereas the living entity is small (<span class="Italic">a&#7751;u</span>), he is perfect in knowledge. The individual exists in darkness when he thinks that he is the material body and that everything in relationship with the material body belongs to him. This is called <span class="Italic">aha&#7745; mama</span> (<span class="Italic">janasya moho &rsquo;yam aha&#7745; mameti</I> [SB </I></span><a href="index7382.html?g=42801">5.5.8</a>]). This is illusion. One must give up his illusory conception and thus become fully aware of everything.</div>

However, one who is in an animalistic conception of life and has no spiritual culture cannot understand. As an expert mineralogist or geologist can understand where there is gold and can then invest his money to dig there and chemically separate the gold from the ore, an expert spiritualist can understand where the soul is within matter. One who has not been trained cannot distinguish between gold and stone. Similarly, fools and rascals who have not learned from an expert spiritual master what is soul and what is matter cannot understand the existence of the soul within the body. To understand such knowledge, one must be trained in the mystic <span class="Italic">yoga</span> system, or, finally, in the <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> system. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexbf7d.html?g=5898">18.55</a>), <span class="Italic">bhakty&#257; m&#257;m abhij&#257;n&#257;ti.</span> Unless one takes shelter of the <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> process, one cannot understand the existence of the soul within the body. Therefore <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> begins by teaching:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">dehino &rsquo;smin yath&#257; dehe<br>kaum&#257;ra&#7745; yauvana&#7745; jar&#257;<br>tath&#257; deh&#257;ntara-pr&#257;ptir<br>dh&#299;ras tatra na muhyati</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.&rdquo; (Bg. <a href="indexf962.html?g=502">2.13</a>) Thus the first instruction is that one should understand that the soul is within the body and is transmigrating from one body to another. This is the beginning of spiritual knowledge. Any person who is not expert in understanding this science or is unwilling to understand it remains in the bodily conception of life, or the animalistic conception of life, as confirmed in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<span class="Italic">yasy&#257;tma-buddhi&#7717; ku&#7751;ape tri-dh&#257;tuke.</span> <span class="Italic">.. sa eva go-khara&#7717;</I> [SB </I></span>10.84.13]). Every member of human society should clearly understand the instructions of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> for only in this way can one be spiritually elevated and automatically give up the false, illusory knowledge by which one thinks, &ldquo;I am this body, and everything belonging to this body is mine [<span class="Italic">aha&#7745; mameti</I> SB </I></span><a href="index7382.html?g=42801">5.5.8</a>].&rdquo; This doggish conception should be rejected immediately. One should be prepared to understand the spirit soul and the supreme spirit, God, who are eternally related. Thus one may return home, back to Godhead, having solved all the problems of life.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego&mdash;all together these eight comprise My separated material energies.&rdquo; <span class="Italic">Bh&#363;mi,</span> earth, includes all the objects of sense perception&mdash;<span class="Italic">r&#363;pa</span> (form), <span class="Italic">rasa</span> (taste), <span class="Italic">gandha</span> (smell), <span class="Italic">&#347;abda</span> (sound) and <span class="Italic">spar&#347;a</span> (touch). Within the earth are the fragrance of roses, the taste of sweet fruit, and whatever else we want. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="index0c75.html?g=9497">1.10.4</a>), <span class="Italic">sarva-k&#257;ma-dugh&#257; mah&#299;:</span> the earth (<span class="Italic">mah&#299;</span>) contains all our requirements. Thus the objects of sense perception are all present in <span class="Italic">bh&#363;mi,</span> or the earth. The gross material elements and subtle material elements (mind, intelligence and <span class="Italic">aha&#7749;k&#257;ra,</span> false ego) constitute the total material energy.</div>
<div class="Purport">Within the total material energy are the three material modes or qualities. These qualities&mdash;<span class="Italic">sattva-gu&#7751;a, rajo-gu&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">tamo-gu&#7751;a</span>&mdash;belong not to the soul but to the material energy. It is because of the interaction of these three material modes of nature that the five knowledge-gathering senses, the five working senses and their controller, the mind, are manifested. Then, according to these modes, the living entity gets the opportunity to perform different types of <span class="Italic">karma</span> with different types of knowledge, thinking, feeling and willing. Thus the bodily machine begins to work.</div>
<div class="Purport">This has all been properly analyzed in <span class="Italic">s&#257;&#7749;khya-yoga</span> by the great <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas,</span> especially by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, in His incarnation as Devah&#363;ti-putra Kapila.

<div class="Purport">The living entity is individual, but the body is a composition of many material elements. This is proved by the fact that as soon as the living entity quits this combination of material elements, it becomes a mere conglomeration of matter. The matter is qualitatively one, and the spiritual soul is qualitatively one with the Supreme. The Supreme is one, and the individual soul is one, but the individual soul is understood to be the master of the individual combination of material energy, whereas the Supreme Lord is the controller of the total material energy. The living entity is the master of his particular body, and according to his activities he is subjected to different types of pains and pleasures. However, although the Supreme Person, the Param&#257;tm&#257;, is also one, He is present as an individual in all the different bodies.</div>
<div class="Purport">The material energy is in fact divided into twenty-four elements. The individual soul, the owner of the individual body, is a twenty-fifth subject, and above everything is Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u as Param&#257;tm&#257;, the supreme controller, who is the twenty-sixth subject. When one understands all of these twenty-six subjects, he becomes <span class="Italic">adhy&#257;tma-vit,</span> an expert in understanding the distinction between matter and spirit. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexc1e9.html?g=4331">13.3</a>), <span class="Italic">k&#7779;etra-k&#7779;etraj&ntilde;ayor j&ntilde;&#257;nam:</span> understanding of the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;etra</span> (the constitution of the body) and of the individual soul and the Supersoul constitutes real <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na,</span> or knowledge. Unless one ultimately understands that the Supreme Lord is eternally related with the individual soul, one&rsquo;s knowledge is imperfect. This is confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index4112.html?g=2631">7.19</a>):</div>

<div class="Translation">Sober and expert persons should search for the spirit soul with minds purified through analytical study in terms of the soul&rsquo;s connection with and distinction from all things that undergo creation, maintenance and destruction.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">A sober person can study himself and distinguish the soul from the body by analytical study. For example, when one considers his body&mdash;his head, his hands and so on&mdash;one can certainly understand the difference between the spirit soul and the body. No one says, &ldquo;I head.&rdquo; Everyone says, &ldquo;My head.&rdquo; Thus there are two entities&mdash;the head and &ldquo;I.&rdquo; They are not identical, although they appear to be one conglomeration.</div>
<div class="Purport">One may argue, &ldquo;When we analyze the body we find a head, hands, legs, a belly, blood, bones, urine, stool and so on, but after everything is considered, where is the existence of the soul?&rdquo; A sober man, however, avails himself of this Vedic instruction:</div>
<div class="Prose-Verse-in-purp"><FC:0,0,0><BC:DC>yato v&#257; im&#257;ni bh&#363;t&#257;ni j&#257;yante; yena j&#257;t&#257;ni j&#299;vanti; yat prayanty abhisa&#7745;vi&#347;anti; tad vijij&ntilde;&#257;sasva; tad brahmeti.<FC><BC></div>
<div class="VerseRef">(<span class="Ref_Italic">Taittir&#299;ya Upani&#7779;ad</span> 3.1.1)</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Thus he can understand that the head, hands, legs and indeed the entire body have grown on the basis of the soul. If the soul is within, the body, head, hands and legs grow, but otherwise they do not. A dead child does not grow up, for the soul is not present. If by a careful analysis of the body one still cannot find the existence of the soul, this is due to his ignorance. How can a gross man fully engaged in materialistic activities understand the soul, which is a small particle of spirit one ten-thousandth the size of the tip of a hair? Such a person foolishly thinks that the material body has grown from a combination of chemicals, although he cannot find them. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> inform us, however, that chemical combinations do not constitute the living force; the living force is the <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;</span> and Param&#257;tm&#257;, and the body grows on the basis of that living force. The fruit of a tree grows and undergoes six kinds of change because of the presence of the tree. If there were no tree, there could be no question of the growth and maturity of fruit. Therefore, beyond the existence of the body are the Param&#257;tm&#257; and <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;</span> within the body. This is the first understanding of spiritual knowledge explained in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> <span class="Italic">Dehino &rsquo;smin yath&#257; dehe</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexf962.html?g=502">2.13</a></I><span class="Italic">]</I>.</span> The body exists because of the presence of the Supreme Lord and the <span class="Italic">j&#299;va,</span> which is part of the Lord.

In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a>) the Lord says, <span class="Italic">sarvasya c&#257;ha&#7745; h&#7771;di sannivi&#7779;&#7789;o matta&#7717; sm&#7771;tir j&ntilde;&#257;nam apohana&#7745; ca:</span> &ldquo;I am seated in everyone&rsquo;s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.&rdquo; The living entities are completely absorbed in the three states of wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep through their intelligence. This intelligence is supplied by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who accompanies the individual soul as a friend. &#346;r&#299;la Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya says that the living entity is sometimes described as <span class="Italic">sattva-buddhi</span> when his intelligence acts directly to perceive pains and pleasures above activities. There is a dreaming state in which understanding comes from the Supreme Personality of Godhead (<span class="Italic">matta&#7717; sm&#7771;tir j&ntilde;&#257;nam apohana&#7745; ca</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a></I>]</I>). The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supersoul, is the supreme controller, and under His direction the living entities are subcontrollers. One must understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead with one&rsquo;s intelligence.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">As one can understand the presence of the air by the aromas it carries, so, under the guidance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can understand the living soul by these three divisions of intelligence. These three divisions, however, are not the soul; they are constituted of the three modes and are born of activities.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">As already explained, there are three states to our existence, namely wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep. In all three states, we have different experiences. Thus the soul is the observer of these three states. Actually, the activities of the body are not the activities of the soul. The soul is different from the body. Just as aromas are distinct from the material vehicle in which they are carried, the soul is unattached to material activities. This analysis can be considered by a person who is fully under the shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord. This is confirmed by the Vedic injunction <span class="Italic">yasmin vij&ntilde;&#257;te sarvam eva&#7745; vij&ntilde;&#257;ta&#7745; bhavati.</span> If one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can automatically understand everything else. Because of not taking shelter of the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet, even great scholars, scientists, philosophers and religionists are always bewildered. This is confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="indexb411.html?g=76083">10.2.32</a>):</div>

<div class="After-Verse">Even though one may artificially think himself liberated from material contamination, if he has not taken shelter of the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet his intelligence is polluted.

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Through polluted intelligence one is subjected to the modes of nature, and thus one is conditioned by material existence. Like a dreaming state in which one falsely suffers, material existence, which is due to ignorance, must be considered unwanted and temporary.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The unwanted condition of temporary life is called ignorance. One can very easily understand that the material body is temporary, for it is generated at a certain date and ends at a certain date, after undergoing the six kinds of change, namely birth, death, growth, maintenance, transformation and dwindling. This condition of the eternal soul is due to his ignorance, and although it is temporary, it is unwanted. Because of ignorance one is put into temporary bodies one after another. The spirit soul, however, does not need to enter such temporary bodies. He does so only due to his ignorance or his forgetfulness of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Therefore in the human form of life, when one&rsquo;s intelligence is developed, one should change his consciousness by trying to understand K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Then one can be liberated. This is confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexe89d.html?g=1505">4.9</a>), where the Lord says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">janma karma ca me divyam<br>eva&#7745; yo vetti tattvata&#7717;<br>tyaktv&#257; deha&#7745; punar janma<br>naiti m&#257;m eti so &rsquo;rjuna</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.&rdquo; Unless one understands K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and comes to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, one must continue in material bondage. To end this conditional life, one must surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Indeed, that is demanded by the Supreme Lord. <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharm&#257;n parityajya m&#257;m eka&#7745; &#347;ara&#7751;a&#7745; vraja</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="index3a32.html?g=5997">18.66</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>

Therefore, if by good association, by the instructions of a bona fide spiritual master, one takes to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, his conditional life of material existence is vanquished, and his original consciousness, known as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, is revived. When one is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious, he can realize that material existence, whether one is awake or dreaming, is nothing but a dream and has no factual value. This realization is possible by the grace of the Supreme Lord. This grace is also present in the form of the instructions of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> Therefore &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu&rsquo;s mission is for everyone to engage in welfare activities to awaken the foolish living entity, especially in human society, so that he may come to the platform of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness and benefit by liberation from conditional life.</div>
<div class="Purport">In this connection, &#346;r&#299;la Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya cites the following verses:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">du&#7717;kha-r&#363;po &rsquo;pi sa&#7745;s&#257;ro<br>buddhi-p&#363;rvam av&#257;pyate<br>yath&#257; svapne &#347;ira&#347; cheda&#7745;<br>svaya&#7745; k&#7771;tv&#257;tmano va&#347;a&#7717;</div>

<div class="After-Verse">One must realize that the material condition of life is full of distresses. One can realize this with purified intelligence. When one&rsquo;s intelligence is purified, he can understand that unwanted, temporary, material life is just like a dream. Just as one suffers pain when his head is cut off in a dream, in ignorance one suffers not only while dreaming but also while awake. Without the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one continues in ignorance and is thus subjected to material distresses in various ways.</div>

<div class="First">Among the linking processes that elevate one from bondage to material contamination, the one recommended by the Supreme Personality of Godhead should be accepted as the best.

Material bondage is a result of sinful activity. Therefore, since the Lord assures that He will dissipate the results of fruitive material activities, there is no need to be worried. This process of understanding one&rsquo;s position as a spirit soul and then engaging oneself in devotional service is therefore the best.

This is the secret of success. For one who adopts this method, the perfect process is revealed. In this verse, the words <span class="Italic">yair a&ntilde;jas&#257; rati&#7717;</span> indicate that by offering service and surrendering to the spiritual master, one is elevated to devotional service, and by performing devotional service one gradually becomes attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because of this attachment to the Lord, one can understand the Lord. In other words, one can understand what the Lord&rsquo;s position is, what our position is and what our relationship is. All this can be understood very easily by the simple method of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> As soon as one is situated on the platform of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> the root cause of one&rsquo;s suffering and material bondage is destroyed. This is clearly explained in the next verse, which gives the secret of success.</div>

<div class="Purport">To practice <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> one must first accept a bona fide spiritual master. &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299;, in his <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhakti-ras&#257;m&#7771;ta-sindhu</span> (1.2.74&ndash;75), advises:</div>

<div class="After-Verse">One&rsquo;s first duty is to accept a bona fide spiritual master. The student or disciple should be very inquisitive; he should be eager to know the complete truth about eternal religion (<span class="Italic">san&#257;tana-dharma</span>). The words <span class="Italic">guru-&#347;u&#347;r&#363;&#7779;ay&#257;</span> mean that one should personally serve the spiritual master by giving him bodily comforts, helping him in bathing, dressing, sleeping, eating and so on.

Everything should be offered to the spiritual master as a matter of duty, but the offering should be made to the spiritual master with heart and soul, not artificially to gain material prestige. This offering is called <span class="Italic">arpa&#7751;a.</span> Moreover, one should live among devotees, saintly persons, to learn the etiquette and proper behavior of devotional service. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura remarks in this connection that whatever is offered to the spiritual master should be offered with love and affection, not for material adoration. Similarly, it is recommended that one associate with devotees, but there must be some discrimination. Actually, a <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhu,</span> a saintly person, must be saintly in his behavior (<span class="Italic">s&#257;dhava&#7717; sad-&#257;c&#257;r&#257;&#7717;</span>). Unless one adheres to the standard behavior, one&rsquo;s position as a <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhu,</span> a saintly person, is not complete. Therefore a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, a <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhu,</span> must completely adhere to the standard of behavior. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura says that a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, a person initiated into the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava cult, should be offered the respect befitting a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, which means that he should be offered service and prayers. However, one should not associate with him if he is not a fit person with whom to associate.</div>

Similarly, when Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appeared He raised the Govardhana Hill when He was only seven years of age. These are uncommon activities. Fools and rascals, who are not in the transcendental position, consider these uncommon activities of the Lord to be mythological, but when the pure devotee, the liberated person, hears about these uncommon activities of the Lord, he immediately becomes ecstatic and exhibits the symptoms of chanting, dancing, and crying very loudly and jubilantly.

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">The devotee is then freed from all material contamination because he constantly thinks of the Lord&rsquo;s pastimes and because his mind and body have been converted to spiritual qualities. Because of his intense devotional service, his ignorance, material consciousness and all kinds of material desires are completely burnt to ashes. This is the stage at which one can achieve the shelter of the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">When a devotee is completely purified, he becomes <span class="Italic">any&#257;bhil&#257;&#7779;it&#257;-&#347;&#363;nya.</span> In other words, all of his material desires become zero, being burnt to ashes, and he exists either as the Lord&rsquo;s servant, friend, father, mother or conjugal lover. Because one thinks constantly in this way, one&rsquo;s present material body and mind are fully spiritualized, and the needs of one&rsquo;s material body completely vanish from one&rsquo;s existence. An iron rod put into a fire becomes warmer and warmer, and when it is red hot it is no longer an iron rod but fire. Similarly, when a devotee constantly engages in devotional service and thinks of the Lord in his original K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, he no longer has any material activities, for his body is spiritualized. Advancement in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness is very powerful, and therefore even during this life such a devotee has achieved the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord. This transcendental ecstatic existence of a devotee was completely exhibited by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. In this regard, &#346;r&#299;la Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya writes as follows:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">tad-bh&#257;va-bh&#257;va&#7717; tad yath&#257; svar&#363;pa&#7745; bhakti&#7717;<br>kecid bhakt&#257; vin&#7771;tyanti g&#257;yanti ca yathepsitam<br>kecit tu&#7779;&#7751;&#299;&#7745; japanty eva kecit &#347;obhaya-k&#257;ri&#7751;a&#7717;</div>
<div class="After-Verse">The ecstatic condition of devotional service was completely exhibited by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, who sometimes danced, sometimes cried, sometimes sang, sometimes remained silent, and sometimes chanted the holy name of the Lord. That is perfect spiritual existence.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">The real problem of life is the repetition of birth and death, which is like a wheel rolling repeatedly up and down. This wheel, however, completely stops when one is in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, by the transcendental bliss realized from constant engagement in devotional service, one is completely liberated from material existence. All learned men know this. Therefore, my dear friends, O sons of the asuras, immediately begin meditating upon and worshiping the Supersoul within everyone&rsquo;s heart.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Generally it is understood that by merging into the existence of Brahman, the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth, one becomes completely happy. The words <span class="Italic">brahma-nirv&#257;&#7751;a</span> refer to connecting with the Absolute Truth, who is realized in three features: <span class="Italic">brahmeti param&#257;tmeti bhagav&#257;n iti &#347;abdyate.</span> One feels <span class="Italic">brahma-sukha,</span> spiritual happiness, by merging into the impersonal Brahman because the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> is the effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">Yasya prabh&#257; prabhavato jagad-a&#7751;&#7693;a-ko&#7789;i</I> [Bs. </span></I>5.40]<span class="Italic">.</span> <span class="Italic">Yasya prabh&#257;,</span> the impersonal Brahman, consists of the rays of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s transcendental body. Therefore whatever transcendental bliss one feels from merging in Brahman is due to contact with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Contact with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is perfect <span class="Italic">brahma-sukha.</span> When the mind is in touch with the impersonal Brahman one becomes satisfied, but one must advance further to render service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for one&rsquo;s remaining merged in the Brahman effulgence is not always assured. As it is said, <span class="Italic">&#257;ruhya k&#7771;cchre&#7751;a para&#7745; pada&#7745; tata&#7717; patanty adho &rsquo;n&#257;d&#7771;ta-yu&#7779;mad-a&#7749;ghraya&#7717;:</I> [SB </span></I><a href="indexb411.html?g=76083">10.2.32</a>] one may merge in the Brahman feature of the Absolute Truth, but there is a chance that one may fall because of not being acquainted with Adhok&#7779;aja, or V&#257;sudeva. Of course, such <span class="Italic">brahma-sukha</span> undoubtedly eliminates material happiness, but when one advances through impersonal Brahman and localized Param&#257;tm&#257; to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead in relationship with Him as a servant, friend, parent or conjugal lover, one&rsquo;s happiness becomes all-pervading. Then one automatically feels transcendental bliss, just as one becomes happy seeing the shining of the moon. One acquires natural happiness upon seeing the moon, but when one can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one&rsquo;s transcendental happiness increases hundreds and thousands of times. As soon as one is very intimately connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one surely becomes free from all material contamination. <span class="Italic">Y&#257; nirv&#7771;tis tanu-bh&#7771;t&#257;m.</span> This cessation of all material happiness is called <span class="Italic">nirv&#7771;ti</span> or <span class="Italic">nirv&#257;&#7751;a.</span> &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhakti-ras&#257;m&#7771;ta-sindhu</span> (1.1.38):</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;If <span class="Italic">brahm&#257;nanda,</span> the bliss of merging in the Brahman effulgence, were multiplied one hundred trillion times, it would still not equal even an atomic fragment of the ocean of transcendental bliss felt in devotional service.&rdquo;</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed toward all living entities. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto the Lord.&rdquo; (Bg. <a href="indexc2a1.html?g=5889">18.54</a>) If one advances further from the <span class="Italic">brahma-nirv&#257;&#7751;a</span> platform, one enters the stage of devotional service (<span class="Italic">mad-bhakti&#7745; labhate par&#257;m</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexc2a1.html?g=5889">18.54</a>]). The word <span class="Italic">adhok&#7779;aj&#257;lambham</span> refers to keeping the mind always engaged in the Absolute Truth, who is beyond the mind and material speculation. <span class="Italic">Sa vai mana&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-pad&#257;ravindayo&#7717;.</span> This is the result of Deity worship. By constantly engaging in the service of the Lord and thinking of His lotus feet, one is automatically freed from all material contamination. Thus the word <span class="Italic">brahma-nirv&#257;&#7751;a-sukham</span> indicates that when one is in touch with the Absolute Truth, material sense gratification is completely nullified.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">O my friends, sons of the asuras, the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His Supersoul feature always exists within the cores of the hearts of all living entities. Indeed, He is the well-wisher and friend of all living entities, and there is no difficulty in worshiping the Lord. Why, then, should people not engage in His devotional service? Why are they so addicted to unnecessarily producing artificial paraphernalia for sense gratification?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Because the Personality of Godhead is supreme, no one is equal to Him, and no one is greater than Him. Nonetheless, if one is a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord is easily obtainable. The Lord is compared to the sky because the sky is vast yet within the reach of all, not only of human beings but even of the animals. The Supreme Lord, in His Param&#257;tm&#257; feature, exists as the best well-wisher and friend. As confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Vedas, sayujau sakh&#257;yau.</span> The Lord, in His Supersoul feature, always stays in the heart along with the living entity. The Lord is so friendly to the living entity that He remains within the heart so that one can always contact Him without difficulty. One can do this simply by devotional service (<span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;a&#7745; k&#299;rtana&#7745; vi&#7779;&#7751;o&#7717; smarana&#7745;.</span> <span class="Italic">p&#257;da-sevanam </I>[SB </span></I><a href="indexda76.html?g=55355">7.5.23</a>]). As soon as one hears of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (<span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-k&#299;rtana</span>), one immediately comes in touch with the Lord. A devotee immediately comes in touch with the Lord by any or all of the items of devotional service:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">&#347;rava&#7751;a&#7745; k&#299;rtana&#7745; vi&#7779;&#7751;o&#7717;<br>smara&#7751;a&#7745; p&#257;da-sevanam<br>arcana&#7745; vandana&#7745; d&#257;sya&#7745;<br>sakhyam &#257;tma-nivedanam<br><span class="Italic"> </I>[SB </span></I><a href="indexda76.html?g=55355">7.5.23</a></I>]</I></div>
<div class="After-Verse">Therefore there is no difficulty in coming in contact with the Supreme Lord (<span class="Italic">ko &rsquo;ti-pray&#257;sa&#7717;</span>). On the other hand, going to hell requires great endeavor. If one wants to go to hell by illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling and intoxication, he must acquire so many things. For illicit sex he must arrange for money for brothels, for meat-eating he must arrange for many slaughterhouses, for gambling he must arrange for casinos and hotels, and for intoxication he must open many breweries. Clearly, therefore, if one wants to go to hell he must endeavor very much, but if he wants to return home, back to Godhead, there is no difficult endeavor. To go back to Godhead, one may live alone anywhere, in any condition, and simply sit down, meditate upon the Supersoul and chant and hear about the Lord. Thus there is no difficulty in approaching the Lord. <span class="Italic">Ad&#257;nta-gobhir vi&#347;at&#257;&#7745; tamisram.</span> Because of inability to control the senses, one must go through great endeavor to go to hell, but if one is sensible he can very easily obtain the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead because the Lord is always with him. By the simple method of <span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;a&#7745; k&#299;rtana&#7745; vi&#7779;&#7751;o&#7717; </I>[SB </span></I><a href="indexda76.html?g=55355">7.5.23</a>]<span class="Italic">,</span> the Lord is satisfied. Indeed, the Lord says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">patra&#7745; pu&#7779;pa&#7745; phala&#7745; toya&#7745;<br>yo me bhakty&#257; prayacchati<br>tad aha&#7745; bhakty-upah&#7771;tam<br>a&#347;n&#257;mi prayat&#257;tmana&#7717;</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it.&rdquo; (Bg. <a href="index8855.html?g=3219">9.26</a>) One can meditate upon the Lord anywhere and everywhere. Thus Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja advised his friends, the sons of the demons, to take this path back home, back to Godhead, without difficulty.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This verse describes how the advocates of economic development are frustrated by the laws of nature. As the previous verse asks, <span class="Italic">ki&#7745; vi&#7779;ayopap&#257;danai&#7717;:</span> what is the actual benefit of so-called economic development? The history of the world has factually proved that attempts to increase economic development for bodily comfort through the advancement of material civilization have done nothing to remedy the inevitability of birth, death, old age and disease. Everyone has knowledge of huge empires throughout the history of the world&mdash;the Roman Empire, the Moghul Empire, the British Empire and so on&mdash;but all the societies engaged in such economic development (<span class="Italic">sarve &rsquo;rtha-k&#257;m&#257;&#7717;</span>) have been frustrated by the laws of nature through periodic wars, pestilence, famine and so on. Thus all their attempts have been flickering and temporary. In this verse, therefore, it is said, <span class="Italic">kurvanti martyasya kiyat priya&#7745; cal&#257;&#7717;:</span> one may be very proud of possessing a vast empire, but such empires are impermanent; after one hundred or two hundred years, everything is finished. All such positions of economic development, although created with great endeavor and hardship, are vanquished very soon. Therefore they have been described as <span class="Italic">cal&#257;&#7717;.</span> An intelligent man should conclude that material economic development is not at all pleasing. The entire world is described in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as <span class="Italic">du&#7717;kh&#257;layam a&#347;&#257;&#347;vatam</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexf129.html?g=2868">8.15</a>]&mdash;miserable and temporary. Economic development may be pleasing for some time, but it cannot endure. Thus many big businessmen are now very morose because they are being harassed by various plundering governments. In conclusion, why should one waste his time for so-called economic development, which is neither permanent nor pleasing to the soul?</div>
<div class="Purport">On the other hand, our relationship with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is eternal. <span class="Italic">Nitya-siddha k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-prema.</span> The pure souls are eternally in love with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and this permanent love, either as a servant, a friend, a parent or a conjugal lover, is not at all difficult to revive. Especially in this age, the concession is that simply by chanting the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra</span> (<span class="Italic">harer n&#257;ma harer n&#257;ma harer n&#257;maiva kevalam</span></I> [Adi </I><a href="indexd751.html?g=93741">17.21</a></I>]</I>) one revives his original relationship with God and thus becomes so happy that he does not want anything material. As enunciated by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, <span class="Italic">na dhana&#7745; na jana&#7745; na sundar&#299;&#7745; kavit&#257;&#7745; v&#257; jagad-&#299;&#347;a k&#257;maye.</span> A very advanced devotee in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness does not want riches, followers or possessions. <span class="Italic">R&#257;ya&#7717; kalatra&#7745; pa&#347;ava&#7717; sut&#257;dayo g&#7771;h&#257; mah&#299; ku&ntilde;jara-ko&#347;a-bh&#363;taya&#7717;.</span> The satisfaction of possessing material opulences, although perhaps of a different standard, is available even in the lives of dogs and hogs, who cannot revive their eternal relationship with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. In human life, however, our eternal, dormant relationship with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is possible to revive. Therefore Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja has described this life as <span class="Italic">arthadam.</span> Consequently, instead of wasting our time for economic development, which cannot give us any happiness, if we simply try to revive our eternal relationship with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, we will properly utilize our lives.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">It is learned from Vedic literature that by performing great sacrifices one may elevate himself to the heavenly planets. However, although life on the heavenly planets is hundreds and thousands of times more comfortable than life on earth, the heavenly planets are not pure [nirmalam], or free from the taint of material existence. The heavenly planets are also temporary, and therefore they are not the goal of life. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, has never been seen or heard to possess inebriety. Consequently, for your own benefit and self-realization, you must worship the Lord with great devotion, as described in the revealed scriptures.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> <span class="Italic">k&#7779;&#299;&#7751;e pu&#7751;ye martya-loka&#7745; vi&#347;anti</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index1885.html?g=3174">9.21</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> Even if one is promoted to the higher planetary systems by performing great sacrifices, which are accompanied by the sinful act of sacrificing animals, the standard of happiness in Svargaloka is also not free of disturbances. There is a similar struggle for existence even for the King of heaven, Indra. Thus there is no practical benefit in promoting oneself to the heavenly planets. Indeed, from the heavenly planets one must return to this earth after one has exhausted the results of his pious activities. In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">tad yatheha karma jito loka&#7717; k&#7779;&#299;yate evam ev&#257;mutra pu&#7751;ya jito loka&#7717; k&#7779;&#299;yata.</span> As the material positions we acquire here by hard work are vanquished in due course of time, one&rsquo;s residence in the heavenly planets is also eventually vanquished. According to one&rsquo;s activities of piety in different degrees, one obtains different standards of life, but none of them are permanent, and therefore they are all impure. Consequently, one should not endeavor to be promoted to the higher planetary systems, only to return to this earth or descend still lower to the hellish planets. To stop this cycle of going up and coming down, one must take to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu therefore said:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">brahm&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a bhramite kona bh&#257;gyav&#257;n j&#299;va<br>guru-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-pras&#257;de p&#257;ya bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja</div>

<div class="After-Verse">The living entity is rotating in the cycle of birth and death, going sometimes to the higher planets and sometimes to the lower planets, but that is not the solution to the problems of life. But if by the grace of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a one is fortunate enough to meet a <span class="Italic">guru,</span> a representative of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, one gets the clue to returning home, back to Godhead, having achieved self-realization. This is what is actually desirable. <span class="Italic">Bhajat&#257;tma-labdhaye:</span> one must take to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness for self-realization.</div>

The body is just like an instrument by which the living entity moves according to false desires for happiness and thus suffers the pangs of birth, death, old age and disease in different standards of life. Everyone begins his activities with some plan and ambition, but actually, from the beginning of one&rsquo;s plan to the end, one does not derive any happiness. On the contrary, as soon as one begins acting according to his plan, his life of distress immediately begins. Therefore, one should not be ambitious to dissipate the unhappy conditions of life, for one cannot do anything about them. <span class="Italic">Aha&#7749;k&#257;ra-vim&#363;&#7693;h&#257;tm&#257; kart&#257;ham iti manyate</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index15ec.html?g=1275">3.27</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> Although one is acting according to false ambitions, he thinks he can improve his material conditions by his activities.

Therefore, it is better to use one&rsquo;s time for advancement in the spiritual life of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. One should not waste his valuable life as a human being.

<div class="First">The word <span class="Italic">&#257;tmaupamyena</span> refers to thinking others to be like oneself. One can very intelligently conclude that without devotional service, without becoming K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious, one cannot be happy. Therefore the duty of all devotees is to preach K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness everywhere all over the world, because all living entities without K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness are suffering the pangs of material existence. To preach K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness is the best welfare activity. Indeed, it is described by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu as <span class="Italic">para-upak&#257;ra,</span> work for the true benefit of others.

<div class="First">The devotees are referred to as <span class="Italic">acyuta-gotra,</span> or the dynasty of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

That is the highest perfection. As K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a never falls, when we revive our spiritual consciousness, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, we never fall again to material existence. One should understand the position of the supreme Acyuta, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexe89d.html?g=1505">4.9</a>):</div>

<div class="First">In this verse the words <span class="Italic">sarvatra tad-&#299;k&#7779;a&#7751;am</span> describe the highest perfection of devotional service, in which one sees everything with reference to Govinda&rsquo;s activities.

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Following the instructions of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, all the sons of the demons became attached to Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When this attachment became pronounced, their teachers, &#7778;a&#7751;&#7693;a and Amarka, were very much afraid that the boys would become more and more devoted to the Lord. In a helpless condition, they approached Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu and described in detail the effect of Prahl&#257;da&rsquo;s preaching. After hearing of this, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu decided to kill his son Prahl&#257;da. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was so angry that Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja fell down at his feet and said many things just to pacify him, but he was unsuccessful in satisfying his demoniac father. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, as a typical demon, began to advertise himself as being greater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja challenged him, saying that Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was not God, and began to glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead, declaring that the Lord is all-pervading, that everything is under Him, and that no one is equal to or greater than Him. Thus he requested his father to be submissive to the omnipotent Supreme Lord.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The more Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja glorified the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the more angry and agitated the demon became. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu asked his Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava son whether his God existed within the columns of the palace, and Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja immediately accepted that since the Lord is present everywhere, He was also present within the columns. When Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu heard this philosophy from his young son, he derided the boy&rsquo;s statement as just the talk of a child and forcefully struck the pillar with his fist.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">As soon as Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu struck the column, there issued forth a tumultuous sound. At first Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, the King of the demons, could not see anything but the pillar, but to substantiate Prahl&#257;da&rsquo;s statements, the Lord came out of the pillar in His wonderful incarnation as Narasi&#7745;ha, half lion and half man. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu could immediately understand that the extraordinarily wonderful form of the Lord was surely meant for his death, and thus he prepared to fight with the form of half lion and half man. The Lord performed His pastimes by fighting with the demon for some time, and in the evening, on the border between day and night, the Lord captured the demon, threw him on His lap, and killed him by piercing his abdomen with His nails. The Lord not only killed Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, the King of the demons, but also killed many of his followers. When there was no one else to fight, the Lord, roaring with anger, sat down on Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu&rsquo;s throne.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The entire universe was thus relieved of the rule of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, and everyone was jubilant in transcendental bliss. Then all the demigods, headed by Lord Brahm&#257;, approached the Lord. These included the great saintly persons, the Pit&#257;s, the Siddhas, the Vidy&#257;dharas, the N&#257;gas, the Manus, the <span class="Italic">praj&#257;patis,</span> the Gandharvas, the C&#257;ra&#7751;as, the Yak&#7779;as, the Kimpuru&#7779;as, the Vait&#257;likas, the Kinnaras and also many other varieties of beings in human form. All of them stood not far from the Supreme Personality of Godhead and began offering their prayers unto the Lord, whose spiritual effulgence was brilliant as He sat on the throne.</div>

He says that <span class="Italic">du&#7717;</span> refers to this material world.

Therefore he was greater than the great <span class="Italic">praj&#257;patis</span> who established their dynasties. The word <span class="Italic">stabdham</span> means obstinate. A devotee does not care for the instructions of the <span class="Italic">asuras.</span> When they give instructions, he remains silent. A devotee cares about the instructions of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, not those of demons or nondevotees.

To give an example, there are different grades of fire, but all of them derive heat and light from the sun. Similarly, all living entities, big or small, are dependent on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava preaching to his demoniac father was indirectly effective, for because of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu&rsquo;s excessive jealousy of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and His devotee, he was inviting N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva to kill him very quickly.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Demons sometimes declare to a devotee that they cannot accept the existence of God because they cannot see Him. But what the demon does not know is stated by the Lord Himself in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index109a.html?g=2685">7.25</a>): <span class="Italic">n&#257;ha&#7745; prak&#257;&#347;a&#7717; sarvasya yogam&#257;y&#257;-sam&#257;v&#7771;ta&#7717;.</span> &ldquo;I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them I am covered by <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;.</span>&rdquo; The Lord is open to being seen by devotees, but nondevotees cannot see Him. The qualification for seeing God is stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> (5.38): <span class="Italic">prem&#257;&ntilde;jana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santa&#7717; sadaiva h&#7771;daye&#7779;u vilokayanti.</span> A devotee who has developed a genuine love for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a can always see Him everywhere, whereas a demon, not having a clear understanding of the Supreme Lord, cannot see Him. When Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was threatening to kill Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, Prahl&#257;da certainly saw the column standing before him and his father, and he saw that the Lord was present in the pillar to encourage him not to fear his demoniac father&rsquo;s words. The Lord was present to protect him. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu marked Prahl&#257;da&rsquo;s observation and asked him, &ldquo;Where is your God?&rdquo; Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja replied, &ldquo;He is everywhere.&rdquo; Then Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu asked, &ldquo;Why is He not in this pillar before me?&rdquo; Thus in all circumstances the devotee can always see the Supreme Lord, whereas the nondevotee cannot.</div>
<div class="Purport">Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja has here been addressed by his father as &ldquo;the most unfortunate.&rdquo; Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu thought himself extremely fortunate because he possessed the property of the universe. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, his legitimate son, was to have inherited this vast property, but because of his impudence, he was going to die at his father&rsquo;s hands. Therefore the demoniac father considered Prahl&#257;da the most unfortunate because Prahl&#257;da would not be able to inherit his property. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu did not know that Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was the most fortunate person within the three worlds because Prahl&#257;da was protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such are the misunderstandings of demons. They do not know that a devotee is protected by the Lord in all circumstances (<span class="Italic">kaunteya pratij&#257;n&#299;hi na me bhakta&#7717; pra&#7751;a&#347;yati</span>).</div>

The Lord appeared as half lion and half man so that Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu could not understand whether the great giant was a lion or a human being.

By appearing from the pillar, the Lord encouraged His devotee, saying in effect, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry.

His ears were erect and motionless, and His nostrils and gaping mouth appeared like caves of a mountain. His jaws parted fearfully, and His entire body touched the sky. His neck was very short and thick, His chest broad, His waist thin, and the hairs on His body as white as the rays of the moon. His arms, which resembled flanks of soldiers, spread in all directions as He killed the demons, rogues and atheists with His conchshell, disc, club, lotus and other natural weapons.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Just as a small insect falls forcefully into a fire and the insignificant creature becomes invisible, when Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu attacked the Lord, who was full of effulgence, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu became invisible. This is not at all astonishing, for the Lord is always situated in pure goodness. Formerly, during creation, He entered the dark universe and illuminated it by His spiritual effulgence.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Lord is situated transcendentally, in pure goodness. The material world is generally controlled by <span class="Italic">tamo-gu&#7751;a,</span> the quality of ignorance, but the spiritual world, because of the presence of the Lord and His effulgence, is free from all contamination by darkness, passion or contaminated goodness. Although there is a tinge of goodness in this material world in terms of the brahminical qualifications, such qualifications sometimes become invisible because of the strong prevalence of the modes of passion and ignorance. But because the Lord is always transcendentally situated, the material modes of passion and ignorance cannot touch Him. Whenever the Lord is present, there cannot be any darkness from the mode of ignorance. It is stated in <span class="Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Madhya</span> <a href="index2b69.html?g=128914">22.31</a>):</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Godhead is light. Nescience is darkness. Where there is Godhead there is no nescience.&rdquo; This material world is full of darkness and ignorance of spiritual life, but by <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> this ignorance is dissipated. The Lord appeared because of the <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> exhibited by Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, and as soon as the Lord appeared, the influence of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu&rsquo;s passion and ignorance was vanquished as the Lord&rsquo;s quality of pure goodness, or the Brahman effulgence, became prominent. In that prominent effulgence, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu became invisible, or his influence became insignificant. An example illustrating how the darkness of the material world is vanquished is given in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra.</span> When Brahm&#257; was created from the lotus stem growing from the abdomen of Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, Lord Brahm&#257; saw everything to be dark, but when he received knowledge from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everything became clear, as everything becomes clear when one comes from night to sunshine. The important point is that as long as we are in the material modes of nature, we are always in darkness. This darkness cannot be dissipated without the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which is invoked by the practice of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti-yoga</span> creates a transcendental situation with no tinges of material contamination.</div>

Within a second, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu and his followers were destroyed, and similarly if this godless civilization continues, it will be destroyed in a second, simply by the movement of one finger of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The demons should therefore be careful and curtail their godless civilization.

Another point is that although Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu treated the Lord as his bitterest enemy, he was the Lord&rsquo;s faithful servant in Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha, and therefore the Lord had no hesitation in sitting on the throne that Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu had so laboriously created. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura remarks in this connection that sometimes, with great care and attention, great saintly persons and <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is</span> offer the Lord valuable seats dedicated with Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras</span> and <span class="Italic">tantras,</span> but still the Lord does not sit upon those thrones. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, however, had formerly been Jaya, the doorkeeper at the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha gate, and although he had fallen because of the curse of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and had gotten the nature of a demon, and although he had never offered anything to the Lord as Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, the Lord is so affectionate to His devotee and servant that He nonetheless took pleasure in sitting on the throne that Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu had created. In this regard it is to be understood that a devotee is fortunate in any condition of his life.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the creator of the material world. There are three processes in creation&mdash;namely creation, maintenance and finally annihilation. During the period of annihilation, at the end of each millennium, the Lord becomes angry, and the part of anger is played by Lord &#346;iva, who is therefore called Rudra. When the Lord appeared in great anger to kill Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, everyone was extremely afraid of the Lord&rsquo;s attitude, but Lord &#346;iva, knowing very well that the Lord&rsquo;s anger is also His <span class="Italic">l&#299;l&#257;,</span> was not afraid. Lord &#346;iva knew that he would have to play the part of anger for the Lord. <span class="Italic">K&#257;la</span> means Lord &#346;iva (Bhairava), and <span class="Italic">kopa</span> refers to the Lord&rsquo;s anger. These words, combined together as <span class="Italic">kopa-k&#257;la,</span> refer to the end of each millennium. Actually the Lord is always affectionate toward His devotees, even though He may appear very angry. Because He is <span class="Italic">avyay&#257;tm&#257;</span>&mdash;because He never falls down&mdash;even when angry the Lord is affectionate toward His devotees. Therefore Lord &#346;iva reminded the Lord to act like an affectionate father toward Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, who was standing by the Lord&rsquo;s side as an exalted, fully surrendered devotee.</div>

<div class="Translation">King Indra said: O Supreme Lord, You are our deliverer and protector. Our shares of sacrifices, which are actually Yours, have been recovered from the demon by You. Because the demoniac king Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was most fearsome, our hearts, which are Your permanent abode, were all overtaken by him. Now, by Your presence, the gloom and darkness in our hearts have been dissipated. O Lord, for those who always engage in Your service, which is more exalted than liberation, all material opulence is insignificant.

<div class="First">In this material world there are two kinds of people&mdash;the <span class="Italic">devat&#257;s</span> (demigods) and the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> (demons). Although the demigods are attached to material enjoyment, they are devotees of the Lord who act according to the rules and regulations of the Vedic injunctions. During the reign of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, everyone was disturbed in the routine duties of Vedic civilization. When Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was killed, all the demigods, who had always been disturbed by Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, felt relief in their general way of life.</div>
<div class="Purport">Because the government in Kali-yuga is full of demons, the living conditions of devotees are always disturbed. Devotees cannot perform <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a,</span> and thus they cannot partake of the remnants of food offered in <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a</span> for the worship of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. The hearts of the demigods are always filled with fear of the demons, and therefore they cannot think of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The engagement of the demigods is to think of the Lord always within the cores of their hearts. The Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexfcdb.html?g=2458">6.47</a>):</div>

Thus their hearts, which are meant to be the abode of the Supreme Lord, are practically occupied by the demons. All the demigods felt relieved when Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was dead, for they could easily think of the Lord. They could then receive the results of sacrifices and become happy even though in the material world.</div>

<div class="First">No one is peaceful if his wealth and wife are forcibly taken away. All the inhabitants of N&#257;galoka, which is situated below the earthly planetary system, were in great anxiety because their wealth had been stolen and their wives kidnapped by Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu. Now, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu having been killed, their wealth and wives were returned, and their wives felt satisfied. The inhabitants of various <span class="Italic">lokas,</span> or planets, offered their respectful obeisances unto the Lord because they were relieved by the death of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu. Disturbances similar to those created by Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu are now taking place all over the world because of demoniac governments. As stated in the Twelfth Canto of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> the men of the governments of Kali-yuga will be no better than rogues and plunderers. Thus the populace will be harassed on one side by scarcity of food and on another by heavy taxation by the government. In other words, the people in most parts of the world in this age are harassed by the ruling principles of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In many places in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> the Supreme Lord, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, refers to the <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> of four <span class="Italic">var&#7751;as</span> and four <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;ramas.</span> He teaches people about this <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> so that all of human society can live peacefully by observing the principles for the four social divisions and four spiritual divisions (<span class="Italic">var&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama</span>) and thus make advancement in spiritual knowledge. The Manus compiled the <span class="Italic">Manu-sa&#7745;hit&#257;.</span> The word <span class="Italic">sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> means Vedic knowledge, and <span class="Italic">manu</span> indicates that this knowledge is given by Manu. The Manus are sometimes incarnations of the Supreme Lord and sometimes empowered living entities. Formerly, many long years ago, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a instructed the sun-god. The Manus are generally sons of the sun-god. Therefore, while speaking to Arjuna about the importance of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a said, <span class="Italic">ima&#7745; vivasvate yoga&#7745; proktav&#257;n aham avyayam vivasv&#257;n manave pr&#257;ha:</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="indexc8a8.html?g=1430">4.1</a></I>]</I> &ldquo;This instruction was given to Vivasv&#257;n, the sun-god, who in turn instructed his son Manu.&rdquo; Manu gave the law known as <span class="Italic">Manu-sa&#7745;hit&#257;,</span> which is full of directions based on <span class="Italic">var&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama</span> concerning how to live as a human being. These are very scientific ways of life, but under the rule of demons like Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, human society breaks all these systems of law and order and gradually becomes lower and lower. Thus there is no peace in the world. The conclusion is that if we want real peace and order in the human society, we must follow the principles laid down by the <span class="Italic">Manu-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> and confirmed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>

Rather, they should stick to their principles as sincere servants of the Lord and rest assured that the demoniac activities directed against them will not be able to stop their devotional service.</div>

Jaya and Vijaya were very much perturbed, but the Lord advised them to act as enemies, for then they would return after three births; otherwise, ordinarily, they would have to take seven births. With this authority, Jaya and Vijaya acted as the Lord&rsquo;s enemies, and now that these two were dead, all the Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas understood that the Lord&rsquo;s killing of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was special mercy bestowed upon them.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">As related in this chapter, Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, following the order of Lord Brahm&#257;, pacified the Lord when the Lord was extremely angry after having killed Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">After Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was killed, the Lord continued to be very angry, and the demigods, headed by Lord Brahm&#257;, could not pacify Him. Even mother Lak&#7779;m&#299;, the goddess of fortune, the constant companion of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, could not dare come before Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva. Then Lord Brahm&#257; asked Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja to go forward and pacify the Lord&rsquo;s anger. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, being confident of the affection of his master, Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva, was not afraid at all. He very gravely appeared before the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet and offered Him respectful obeisances. Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva, being very much affectionate toward Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, put His hand on Prahl&#257;da&rsquo;s head, and because of being personally touched by the Lord, Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja immediately achieved <span class="Italic">brahma-j&ntilde;&#257;na,</span> spiritual knowledge. Thus he offered his prayers to the Lord in full spiritual knowledge and full devotional ecstasy. The instructions given by Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja in the form of his prayers are as follows.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Prahl&#257;da said, &ldquo;I am not proud of being able to offer prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I simply take shelter of the mercy of the Lord, for without devotion one cannot appease Him. One cannot please the Supreme Personality of Godhead simply by dint of high parentage or great opulence, learning, austerity, penance or mystic power. Indeed, these are never pleasing to the Supreme Lord, for nothing can please Him but pure devotional service. Even if a nondevotee is a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> qualified with the twelve brahminical symptoms, he cannot be very dear to the Lord, whereas if a person born in a family of dog-eaters is a devotee, the Lord can accept his prayers. The Lord does not need anyone&rsquo;s prayers, but if a devotee offers his prayers to the Lord, the devotee benefits greatly. Ignorant persons born in low families, therefore, can sincerely offer heartfelt prayers to the Lord, and the Lord will accept them. As soon as one offers his prayers to the Lord, he is immediately situated on the Brahman platform.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva appeared for the benefit of all human society, not only for Prahl&#257;da&rsquo;s personal benefit. The fierce form of Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva may appear most awful to a nondevotee, but to the devotee the Lord is always affectionate as He is in other forms. Conditioned life in the material world is actually extremely fearful; indeed, a devotee is not afraid of anything else. Fear of material existence is due to false ego. Therefore the ultimate goal of life for every living entity is to attain the position of being servant of the servant of the Lord. The miserable condition of the living entities in the material world can be remedied only by the mercy of the Lord. Although there are so-called material protectors like Lord Brahm&#257; and the other demigods, or even one&rsquo;s own father, they are unable to do anything if one is neglected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. However, one who has fully taken shelter of the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet can be saved from the onslaught of material nature. Therefore every living entity should be unattracted by material so-called happiness and should take shelter of the Lord by all means. That is the mission of human life. To be attracted by sense gratification is simply foolish. Whether one is a devotee of the Lord or is a nondevotee does not depend upon one&rsquo;s birth in a high or low family. Even Lord Brahm&#257; and the goddess of fortune cannot achieve the full favor of the Lord, whereas a devotee can very easily attain such devotional service. The Lord&rsquo;s mercy is bestowed equally upon everyone, regardless of whether one is high or low. Because Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was blessed by N&#257;rada Muni, Prahl&#257;da became a great devotee. The Lord always saves the devotee from impersonalists and voidists. The Lord is present in everyone&rsquo;s heart as the Supersoul to give the living being protection and all benefits. Thus the Lord acts sometimes as the killer and sometimes as the protector. One should not accuse the Lord for any discrepancies. It is His plan that we see varieties of life within this material world. All of them are ultimately His mercy.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Although the entire cosmic manifestation is nondifferent, the material world is nonetheless different from the spiritual world. Only by the mercy of the Supreme Lord can one understand how the wonderful material nature acts. For example, although Lord Brahm&#257; appeared from the lotus seat that had grown from the abdomen of Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, he could not understand what to do after his appearance. He was attacked by two demons, Madhu and Kai&#7789;abha, who took away Vedic knowledge, but the Lord killed them and entrusted to Lord Brahm&#257; the Vedic knowledge. Thus the Lord appears in every millennium in the societies of demigods, human beings, animals, saints and aquatics. All such incarnations are meant to protect the devotees and kill the demons, but this killing and protecting does not reflect any sense of partiality on the part of the Supreme Lord. The conditioned soul is always attracted by the external energy. Therefore he is subjected to lust and greed, and he suffers under the conditions of material nature. The Lord&rsquo;s causeless mercy toward His devotee is the only means by which to get out of material existence. Anyone engaged in glorifying the Lord&rsquo;s activities is always unafraid of this material world, whereas one who cannot glorify the Lord in that way is subjected to all lamentation.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Those interested in silently worshiping the Lord in solitary places may be eligible for liberation themselves, but a pure devotee is always aggrieved to see others suffering. Therefore, not caring for his own liberation, he always engages in preaching by glorifying the Lord. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, therefore, had tried to deliver his class friends by preaching and had never remained silent. Although being silent, observing austerities and penances, learning the Vedic literature, undergoing ritualistic ceremonies, living in a solitary place and performing <span class="Italic">japa</span> and transcendental meditation are approved means of liberation, they are meant for nondevotees or for cheaters who want to live at the expense of others. A pure devotee, however, being freed from all such deceptive activities, is able to see the Lord face to face.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The atomic theory of the composition of the cosmic manifestation is not factual. The Lord is the cause of everything, and therefore He is the cause of this creation. One should therefore always engage in devotional service by offering respectful obeisances to the Lord, offering prayers, working for the Lord, worshiping the Lord in the temple, always remembering the Lord and always hearing about His transcendental activities. Without these six kinds of activity, one cannot attain to devotional service.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja thus offered his prayers to the Supreme Lord, begging His mercy at every step. Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva was pacified by Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s prayers and wanted to give him benedictions by which Prahl&#257;da could procure all kinds of material facilities. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, however, was not misled by material facilities. Rather, he wanted to remain always a servant of the servant of the Lord.</div>

No one was able to pacify the Lord in His anger, but because the Lord was willing to exhibit His affection for Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, all the demigods and the others present before the Lord pushed Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja forward to pacify Him.</div>

By the grace of the Lord, a devotee can very easily understand how the Lord can appear in any form He likes. Therefore the devotee is never afraid of such a form. Because of special favor bestowed upon Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, he remained silent and unafraid, even though all the demigods, including even Lak&#7779;m&#299;dev&#299;, were afraid of Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva. <span class="Italic">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a-par&#257;&#7717; sarve na kuta&#347;cana bibhyati</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="indexb5dd.html?g=52522">6.17.28</a>).

<div class="Translation">Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja prayed: How is it possible for me, who have been born in a family of asuras, to offer suitable prayers to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead? Even until now, all the demigods, headed by Lord Brahm&#257;, and all the saintly persons, could not satisfy the Lord by streams of excellent words, although such persons are very qualified, being in the mode of goodness.

<div class="First">A Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava who is fully qualified to serve the Lord still thinks himself extremely low while offering prayers to the Lord.

Similarly, although Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was a pure, exalted Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, he thought himself most unqualified to offer prayers to the Supreme Lord. <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;jano yena gata&#7717; sa panth&#257;&#7717;.</span> Every pure Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava should think like this.

There are four <span class="Italic">var&#7751;as</span> and four <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;ramas,</span> which divide human society, but the central principle is to become a first-class pure devotee. It is said in the <span class="Italic">Hari-bhakti&mdash;sudhodaya:</span></div>

<div class="After-Verse">The European and American devotees in the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement are sometimes accepted as <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> but the so-called caste <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are very much envious of them. In answer to such envy, Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja says that one who has been born in a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> family but is falsely proud of his prestigious position cannot even purify himself, not to speak of his family, whereas if a <span class="Italic">ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la,</span> a lowborn person, is a devotee and has fully surrendered unto the lotus feet of the Lord, he can purify his entire family. We have had actual experience of how Americans and Europeans, because of their full K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, have purified their whole families, so much so that a mother of a devotee, at the time of her death, inquired about K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a with her last breath. Therefore it is theoretically true and has been practically proven that a devotee can give the best service to his family, his community, his society and his nation. The foolish accuse a devotee of following the principle of escapism, but actually the fact is that a devotee is the right person to elevate his family. A devotee engages everything in the service of the Lord, and therefore he is always exalted.</div>

<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">na m&#257;&#7745; du&#7779;k&#7771;tino m&#363;&#7693;h&#257;&#7717;<br>prapadyante nar&#257;dham&#257;&#7717;<br>m&#257;yay&#257;pah&#7771;ta-j&ntilde;&#257;n&#257;<br>&#257;sura&#7745; bh&#257;vam&#257;&#347;rit&#257;&#7717;</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me.&rdquo; Because of ignorance and misfortune, the atheists and the <span class="Italic">nar&#257;dhamas,</span> the lowest of men, do not surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore although the Supreme Lord, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, is full in Himself, He appears in different <span class="Italic">yugas</span> to demand the surrender of the conditioned souls so that they will benefit by becoming free from the material clutches. In conclusion, the more we engage in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness and render service unto the Lord, the more we benefit. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a does not need service from any of us.</div>

<div class="Translation">O my Lord, all the demigods, headed by Lord Brahm&#257;, are sincere servants of Your Lordship, who are situated in a transcendental position. Therefore they are not like us [Prahl&#257;da and his father, the demon Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu]. Your appearance in this fearsome form is Your pastime for Your own pleasure.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja wanted to assert that his father and the other members of his family were all unfortunate because they were demoniac, whereas the devotees of the Lord are always fortunate because they are always ready to follow the orders of the Lord. When the Supreme Lord appears in this material world in His various incarnations, He performs two functions&mdash;saving the devotee and vanquishing the demon (<span class="Italic">paritr&#257;&#7751;&#257;ya s&#257;dh&#363;n&#257;&#7745; vin&#257;&#347;&#257;ya ca du&#7779;k&#7771;t&#257;m</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexb53f.html?g=1496">4.8</a>]). Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva, for example, appeared for the protection of His devotee. Such pastimes as those of N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva are certainly not meant to create a fearful situation for the devotees, but nonetheless the devotees, being very simple and faithful, were afraid of the fierce incarnation of the Lord. Therefore Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, in the following prayer, requests the Lord to give up His anger.</div>

<div class="First">The most important point in this verse is that although saintly persons never desire the killing of any living entity, they take pleasure in the killing of envious living entities like snakes and scorpions. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was killed because he was worse than a snake or a scorpion, and therefore everyone was happy. Now there was no need for the Lord to be angry. The devotees can always remember the form of N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva when they are in danger, and therefore the appearance of N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva was not at all inauspicious. The Lord&rsquo;s appearance is always worshipable and auspicious for all sane persons and devotees.</div>

The lion is very fearsome for other animals, but its cubs are not at all afraid of the lion. The water of the sea is certainly dreadful for all living entities on the land, but within the sea even the small fish is unafraid. Why? Because the small fish has taken shelter of the big ocean. It is said that although great elephants are taken away by the flooding waters of the river, the small fish swim opposite the current.

<div class="Translation">O most powerful, insurmountable Lord, who are kind to the fallen souls, I have been put into the association of demons as a result of my activities, and therefore I am very much afraid of my condition of life within this material world. When will that moment come when You will call me to the shelter of Your lotus feet, which are the ultimate goal for liberation from conditional life?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Being in the material world is certainly miserable, but certainly when one is put into the association of <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> or atheistic men, it is intolerably so. One may ask why the living entity is put into the material world. Indeed, sometimes foolish people deride the Lord for having put them here. Actually, everyone is put into conditional life according to his <span class="Italic">karma.</span> Therefore Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, representing all the other conditioned souls, admits that he was put into life among the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> because of the results of his <span class="Italic">karma.</span> <span class="Italic">The</span> Lord is known as <span class="Italic">k&#7771;pa&#7751;a-vatsala</span> because He is extremely kind to the conditioned souls. As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> therefore, the Lord appears whenever there are discrepancies in the execution of religious principles (<span class="Italic">yad&#257; yad&#257; hi dharmasya gl&#257;nir bhavati bh&#257;rata.</span> <span class="Italic">.. tad&#257;tm&#257;na&#7745; s&#7771;j&#257;my aham</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexd622.html?g=1487">4.7</a>]). The Lord is extremely anxious to deliver the conditioned souls, and therefore He instructs all of us to return home, back to Godhead (<span class="Italic">sarva-dharm&#257;n parityajya m&#257;m eka&#7745; &#347;ara&#7751;a&#7745; vraja</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="index3a32.html?g=5997">18.66</a>]). Thus Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja expected that the Lord, by His kindness, would call him again to the shelter of His lotus feet. In other words, everyone should be eager to return home, back to Godhead, taking shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord and thus being fully trained in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness.</div>

<div class="Translation">O great one, O Supreme Lord, because of combination with pleasing and displeasing circumstances and because of separation from them, one is placed in a most regrettable position, within heavenly or hellish planets, as if burning in a fire of lamentation. Although there are many remedies by which to get out of miserable life, any such remedies in the material world are more miserable than the miseries themselves. Therefore I think that the only remedy is to engage in Your service. Kindly instruct me in such service.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja aspired to engage in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord. After the death of his father, who was materially very opulent, Prahl&#257;da would have inherited his father&rsquo;s property, which extended throughout the world, but Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was not inclined to accept such material opulence, for whether one is in the heavenly or hellish planets or is a rich or a poor man&rsquo;s son, material conditions are everywhere. Therefore no condition of life is at all pleasing. If one wants the uncontaminated pleasure of blissful life, he must engage himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Material opulence may be somewhat pleasing for the time being, but to come to that temporary pleasing condition one must work extremely hard. When a poor man is rich he may be better situated, but to come to that position he had to accept many miseries. The fact is that in material life, whether one is miserable or happy, both conditions are miserable. If one actually wants happy, blissful life, one must become K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious and constantly engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. That is the real remedy. The entire world is under the illusion that people will be happy by advancing in materialistic measures to counteract the miseries of conditional life, but this attempt will never be successful. Humanity must be trained to engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. That is the purpose of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement. There can be no happiness in changing one&rsquo;s material conditions, for everywhere there is trouble and misery.</div>

<div class="Translation">O my Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva, by engaging in Your transcendental loving service in the association of devotees who are liberated souls [ha&#7745;sas], I shall become completely uncontaminated by the association of the three modes of material nature and be able to chant the glories of Your Lordship, who are so dear to me. I shall chant Your glories, following exactly in the footsteps of Lord Brahm&#257; and his disciplic succession. In this way I shall undoubtedly be able to cross the ocean of nescience.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">A devotee&rsquo;s life and duty are very well explained herein. As soon as a devotee can chant the holy name and glories of the Supreme Lord, he certainly comes to the liberated position. Attachment for glorifying the Lord by hearing and chanting the holy name and activities of the Lord (<span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;a&#7745; k&#299;rtana&#7745; vi&#7779;&#7751;o&#7717; </I>[SB </I></span><a href="indexda76.html?g=55355">7.5.23</a>]) certainly brings one to the position where material contamination is absent. One should chant the bona fide songs received from the disciplic succession. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is said that the chanting is powerful when one follows the disciplic succession (<span class="Italic">eva&#7745; parampar&#257;-pr&#257;ptam ima&#7745; r&#257;jar&#7779;ayo vidu&#7717;</span> </I>[Bg. </I><a href="indexc8c3.html?g=1440">4.2</a></I>]</I>). Manufacturing many ways of chanting will never be effective. However, chanting the song or the narration left by the previous <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> (<span class="Italic">mah&#257;jano yena gata&#7717; sa panth&#257;&#7717;</span>) is extremely effective, and this process is very easy. Therefore in this verse Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja uses the word <span class="Italic">a&ntilde;ja&#7717;</span> (&ldquo;easily&rdquo;). Accepting the thoughts of exalted authorities through disciplic succession is certainly much easier than the method of mental speculation, by which one tries to invent some means to understand the Absolute Truth. The best process is to accept the instructions of the previous <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> and follow them. Then God realization and self-realization become extremely easy. By following this easy method, one is liberated from the contamination of the material modes of nature, and thus one can certainly cross the ocean of nescience, in which there are many miserable conditions. By following in the footsteps of the great <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas,</span> one associates with the <span class="Italic">ha&#7745;sas</span> or <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sas,</span> those who are completely freed from material contamination. Indeed, by following the instructions of the <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> one is always freed from all material contamination, and thus one&rsquo;s life becomes successful, for one reaches the goal of life. This material world is miserable, regardless of one&rsquo;s standard of life. Of this there is no doubt. Attempts to mitigate the miseries of material existence by material methods will never be successful. One must take to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness to become really happy; otherwise happiness is impossible. One might say that becoming advanced in spiritual life also involves <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> voluntary acceptance of some inconvenience. However, such inconvenience is not as dangerous as material attempts to mitigate all miseries.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">My Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva, O Supreme, because of a bodily conception of life, embodied souls neglected and not cared for by You cannot do anything for their betterment. Whatever remedies they accept, although perhaps temporarily beneficial, are certainly impermanent. For example, a father and mother cannot protect their child, a physician and medicine cannot relieve a suffering patient, and a boat on the ocean cannot protect a drowning man.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Through parental care, through remedies for different kinds of disease, and through means of protection on the water, in the air and on land, there is always an endeavor for relief from various kinds of suffering in the material world, but none of them are guaranteed measures for protection. They may be beneficial temporarily, but they afford no permanent benefit. Despite the presence of a father and mother, a child cannot be protected from accidental death, disease and various other miseries. No one can help, including the parents. Ultimately the shelter is the Lord, and one who takes shelter of the Lord is protected. This is guaranteed. As the Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexa9e1.html?g=3264">9.31</a>), <span class="Italic">kaunteya pratij&#257;n&#299;hi na me bhakta&#7717; pra&#7751;a&#347;yati:</span> &ldquo;O son of Kunt&#299;, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes.&rdquo; Therefore, unless one is protected by the mercy of the Lord, no remedial measure can act effectively. One should consequently depend fully on the causeless mercy of the Lord. Although as a matter of routine duty one must of course accept other remedial measures, no one can protect one who is neglected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this material world, everyone is trying to counteract the onslaught of material nature, but everyone is ultimately fully controlled by material nature. Therefore even though so-called philosophers and scientists try to surmount the onslaught of material nature, they have not been able to do so. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index8818-2.html?g=4371">13.9</a>) that the real sufferings of the material world are four&mdash;<span class="Italic">janma-m&#7771;tyu jar&#257;-vy&#257;dhi</span> (birth, death, old age and disease). In the history of the world, no one has been successful in conquering these miseries imposed by material nature. <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;te&#7717; kriyam&#257;&#7751;&#257;ni gu&#7751;ai&#7717; karm&#257;&#7751;i sarva&#347;a&#7717;</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index15ec.html?g=1275">3.27</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> Nature (<span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti</span>) is so strong that no one can overcome her stringent laws. So-called scientists, philosophers, religionists and politicians should therefore conclude that they cannot offer facilities to the people in general. They should make vigorous propaganda to awaken the populace and raise them to the platform of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. Our humble attempt to propagate the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement all over the world is the only remedy that can bring about a peaceful and happy life. We can never be happy without the mercy of the Supreme Lord (<span class="Italic">tvad-upek&#7779;it&#257;n&#257;m</span>). If we keep displeasing our supreme father, we shall never be happy within this material world, in either the upper or lower planetary systems.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">O Lord, O supreme eternal, by expanding Your plenary portion You have created the subtle bodies of the living entities through the agency of Your external energy, which is agitated by time. Thus the mind entraps the living entity in unlimited varieties of desires to be fulfilled by the Vedic directions of karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a [fruitive activity] and the sixteen elements. Who can get free from this entanglement unless he takes shelter at Your lotus feet?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">If the hand of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is present in everything, where is the question of being liberated from material encagement to spiritual, blissful life? Indeed, it is a fact that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the source of everything, as we understand from K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">aha&#7745; sarvasya prabhava&#7717;</span>). All the activities in both the spiritual and material world are certainly conducted by the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the agency of either the material or spiritual nature. As further confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index652d.html?g=3075">9.10</a>), <span class="Italic">may&#257;dhyak&#7779;e&#7751;a prak&#7771;ti&#7717; s&#363;yate sacar&#257;caram:</span> without the direction of the Supreme Lord, material nature cannot do anything; it cannot act independently. Therefore, in the beginning the living entity wanted to enjoy the material energy, and to give the living entity all facility, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, created this material world and gave the living entity the facility to concoct different ideas and plans through the mind. These facilities offered by the Lord to the living entity constitute the sixteen kinds of perverted support in terms of the knowledge-gathering senses, the working senses, the mind and the five material elements. The wheel of repeated birth and death is created by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but to direct the bewildered living entity in progress toward liberation according to varied stages of advancement, different directions are given in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> (<span class="Italic">chandomayam</span>). If one wants to be elevated to the higher planetary systems, he may follow the Vedic directions. As the Lord states in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index0567.html?g=3210">9.25</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">y&#257;nti deva-vrat&#257; dev&#257;n<br>pit&#7773;n y&#257;nti pit&#7771;-vrat&#257;&#7717;<br>bh&#363;t&#257;ni y&#257;nti bh&#363;tejy&#257;<br>y&#257;nti mad-y&#257;jino &rsquo;pi m&#257;m</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Those who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods; those who worship ghosts and spirits will take birth among such beings; those who worship ancestors go to the ancestors; and those who worship Me will live with Me.&rdquo; The real purpose of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is to direct one back home, back to Godhead, but the living entity, not knowing the real goal of his life, wants to go sometimes here and sometimes there and do sometimes this and sometimes that. In this way he wanders throughout the entire universe, imprisoned in various species and thus engaging in various activities for which he must suffer the reactions. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu therefore says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">brahm&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a bhramite kona bh&#257;gyav&#257;n j&#299;va<br>guru-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-pras&#257;de p&#257;ya bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja</div>

<div class="After-Verse">The fallen, conditioned living entity, trapped by the external energy, loiters in the material world, but if by good fortune he meets a bona fide representative of the Lord who gives him the seed of devotional service, and if he takes advantage of such a <span class="Italic">guru,</span> or representative of God, he receives the <span class="Italic">bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja,</span> the seed of devotional service. If he properly cultivates K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, he is then gradually elevated to the spiritual world. The ultimate conclusion is that one must surrender to the principles of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> for then one will gradually attain liberation. No other method of liberation from the material struggle is at all possible.</div>

<div class="First">The wheel of material miseries is also a creation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but He is not under the control of the material energy. Rather, He is the controller of the material energy, whereas we, the living entities, are under its control. When we give up our constitutional position (<span class="Italic">j&#299;vera &lsquo;svar&#363;pa&rsquo; haya&mdash;k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;era &lsquo;nitya-d&#257;sa</span>&rsquo;<span class="Italic"> </I>[</I></span>Cc. <span class="Ref_Italic">Madhya</span> <a href="indexf61a.html?g=125576">20.108</a>]), the Supreme Personality of Godhead creates this material energy and her influence over the conditioned soul. Therefore He is the Supreme, and only He can deliver the conditioned soul from the onslaught of material nature (<span class="Italic">m&#257;m eva ye prapadyante m&#257;y&#257;m et&#257;&#7745; taranti te</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexd990.html?g=2586">7.14</a>]). <span class="Italic">M&#257;y&#257;,</span> the external energy, continuously imposes upon the conditioned souls the suffering of the threefold miseries of this material world. Therefore, in the previous verse, Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja prayed to the Lord, &ldquo;But for Your Lordship, no one can save me.&rdquo; Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja has also explained that a child&rsquo;s protectors, his parents, cannot save the child from the onslaught of birth and death, nor can medicine and a physician save one from death, nor can a boat or similar means of protection save a person drowning in the water, for everything is controlled by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore suffering humanity must surrender to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself demands in the last instruction of <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index3a32.html?g=5997">18.66</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">sarva-dharm&#257;n parityajya<br>m&#257;m eka&#7745; &#347;ara&#7751;a&#7745; vraja<br>aha&#7745; tv&#257;&#7745; sarva-p&#257;pebhyo<br>mok&#7779;ayi&#7779;y&#257;mi m&#257; &#347;uca&#7717;</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.&rdquo; All of human society must take advantage of this offer and thus be saved by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a from the danger of being crushed by the wheel of time, the wheel of past, present and future.</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">ni&#7779;p&#299;&#7693;yam&#257;nam</span> (&ldquo;being crushed&rdquo;) is very significant. Every living entity in the material condition is actually being crushed again and again, and to be saved from this position one must take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then one will be happy. The word <span class="Italic">prapannam</span> is also very significant, for unless one fully surrenders to the Supreme Lord one cannot be saved from being crushed. A criminal is put in prison and punished by the government, but the same government, if it likes, can release the criminal from imprisoned life. Similarly, we must know conclusively that our material condition of suffering has been allotted to us by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and if we want to be saved from this suffering, we must appeal to the same controller. Thus one can be saved from this material condition.</div>

Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja formerly gathered the same experience by seeing the activities of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, his great father. Therefore Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja did not give any importance to anything in this material world. No one can maintain his body or material achievements forever. A Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava can understand that nothing within this material world, not even that which is powerful, opulent or influential, can endure. At any time such things may be vanquished.

<div class="First">By studying <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> every intelligent man can get experience like that of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja through the historical incidents mentioned in this great literature of spiritual knowledge. By following in the footsteps of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, one should gain thorough experience that all material opulence is perishable at every moment. Even this body, for which we try to acquire so many sensual pleasures, may perish at any time. The soul, however, is eternal. <span class="Italic">Na hanyate hanyam&#257;ne &#347;ar&#299;re:</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="indexd7ba.html?g=565">2.20</a></I>]</I> the soul is never vanquished, even when the body is destroyed. An intelligent man, therefore, should care for the happiness of the spirit soul, not of the body. Even if one receives a body with a long duration of life, like those of Lord Brahm&#257; and the other great demigods, it will also be destroyed, and therefore an intelligent man should be concerned with the imperishable spirit soul.</div>
<div class="Purport">To save oneself, one must take shelter of a pure devotee. Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura therefore says, <span class="Italic">ch&#257;&#7693;iy&#257; vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-sev&#257; nist&#257;ra p&#257;yeche keb&#257;.</span> If one wants to save himself from material nature&rsquo;s onslaughts, which arise because of the material body, one must become K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious and try to fully understand K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexe89d.html?g=1505">4.9</a>), <span class="Italic">janma karma ca me divyam eva&#7745; yo vetti tattvata&#7717;.</span> One should understand K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in truth, and this one can do only by serving a pure devotee. Thus Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja prays that Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva place him in touch with a pure devotee and servant instead of awarding him material opulence. Every intelligent man within this material world must follow Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;jano yena gata&#7717; sa panth&#257;&#7717;.</span> Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja did not want to enjoy the estate left by his father; rather, he wanted to become a servant of the servant of the Lord.

<div class="Translation">In this material world, every living entity desires some future happiness, which is exactly like a mirage in the desert. Where is water in the desert, or, in other words, where is happiness in this material world? As for this body, what is its value? It is merely a source of various diseases. The so-called philosophers, scientists and politicians know this very well, but nonetheless they aspire for temporary happiness. Happiness is very difficult to obtain, but because they are unable to control their senses, they run after the so-called happiness of the material world and never come to the right conclusion.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">There is a song in the Bengali language which states, &ldquo;I constructed this home for happiness, but unfortunately there was a fire, and everything has now been burnt to ashes.&rdquo; This illustrates the nature of material happiness. Everyone knows it, but nonetheless one plans to hear or think something very pleasing. Unfortunately, all of one&rsquo;s plans are annihilated in due course of time. There were many politicians who planned empires, supremacy and control of the world, but in due time all their plans and empires&mdash;and even the politicians themselves&mdash;were vanquished. Everyone should take lessons from Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja about how we are engaged in so-called temporary happiness through bodily exercises for sense enjoyment. All of us repeatedly make plans, which are all repeatedly frustrated. Therefore one should stop such planmaking.</div>
<div class="Purport">As one cannot stop a blazing fire by constantly pouring ghee upon it, one cannot satisfy oneself by increasing plans for sense enjoyment. The blazing fire is <span class="Italic">bhava-mah&#257;-d&#257;v&#257;gni,</span> the forest fire of material existence. This forest fire occurs automatically, without endeavor. We want to be happy in the material world, but this will never be possible; we shall simply increase the blazing fire of desires. Our desires cannot be satisfied by illusory thoughts and plans; rather, we have to follow the instructions of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a: <span class="Italic">sarva-dharm&#257;n parityajya m&#257;m eka&#7745; &#347;ara&#7751;a&#7745; vraja</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="index3a32.html?g=5997">18.66</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then we shall be happy.

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">O my Lord, O Supreme, because I was born in a family full of the hellish material qualities of passion and ignorance, what is my position? And what is to be said of Your causeless mercy, which was never offered even to Lord Brahm&#257;, Lord &#346;iva or the goddess of fortune, Lak&#7779;m&#299;? You never put Your lotus hand upon their heads, but You have put it upon mine.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was surprised at the causeless mercy of the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, for although Prahl&#257;da was born in a demoniac family and although the Lord had never before placed His lotus hand on the head of Brahm&#257;, &#346;iva or the goddess of fortune, His constant companion, Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva kindly placed His hand on the head of Prahl&#257;da. This is the meaning of causeless mercy. The causeless mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead may be bestowed upon anyone, regardless of his position in this material world. Everyone is eligible to worship the Supreme Lord, irrespective of his material position. This is confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexee26.html?g=4817">14.26</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">m&#257;&#7745; ca yo &rsquo;vyabhic&#257;re&#7751;a<br>bhakti yogena sevate<br>sa gu&#7751;&#257;n samat&#299;tyait&#257;n<br>brahma-bh&#363;y&#257;ya kalpate</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.&rdquo; Anyone who engages in continuous devotional service to the Lord is situated in the spiritual world and has nothing to do with the material qualities (<span class="Italic">sattva-gu&#7751;a, rajo-gu&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">tamo-gu&#7751;a</span>).</div>
<div class="Purport">Because Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was situated on the spiritual platform, he had nothing to do with his body, which had been born of the modes of passion and ignorance. The symptoms of passion and ignorance are described in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="index517e.html?g=6496">1.2.19</a>) as lust and hankering (<span class="Italic">tad&#257; rajas tamo-bh&#257;v&#257;&#7717; k&#257;ma-lobh&#257;daya&#347; ca ye</span>). Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, being a great devotee, thought the body born of his father to be born of passion and ignorance, but because Prahl&#257;da was fully engaged in the service of the Lord, his body did not belong to the material world. The pure Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava&rsquo;s body is spiritualized even in this life. For example, when iron is put into a fire it becomes red-hot and is no longer iron but fire. Similarly, the so-called material bodies of devotees who fully engage in the devotional service of the Lord, being constantly in the fire of spiritual life, have nothing to do with matter, but are spiritualized.</div>
<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299;la Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya remarks that the goddess of fortune, the mother of the universe, could not get mercy similar to that which was offered to Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, for although the goddess of fortune is always a constant companion of the Supreme Lord, the Lord is more inclined to His devotees. In other words, devotional service is so great that when it is offered even by those born in low families, the Lord accepts it as being more valuable than the service offered by the goddess of fortune. Lord Brahm&#257;, King Indra and the other demigods living in the upper planetary systems are situated in a different spirit of consciousness, and therefore they are sometimes troubled by demons, but a devotee, even if situated in the lower planets, enjoys life in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness under any circumstances. <span class="Italic">parata&#7717; svata&#7717; karmata&#7717;:</span> as he acts himself, as he is instructed by others or as he performs his material activities, he enjoys life in every respect.

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Unlike an ordinary living entity, my Lord, You do not discriminate between friends and enemies, the favorable and the unfavorable, because for You there is no conception of higher and lower. Nonetheless, You offer Your benedictions according to the level of one&rsquo;s service, exactly as a desire tree delivers fruits according to one&rsquo;s desires and makes no distinction between the lower and the higher.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index477f.html?g=1523">4.11</a>) the Lord clearly says, <span class="Italic">ye yath&#257; m&#257;&#7745; prapadyante t&#257;&#7745;s tathaiva bhaj&#257;my aham:</span> <span class="Italic">&ldquo;As</span> one surrenders to Me, I reward him accordingly.&rdquo; As stated by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, <span class="Italic">j&#299;vera &lsquo;svar&#363;pa&rsquo; haya&mdash;k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;era &lsquo;nitya-d&#257;sa&rsquo;: </I>[</I></span>Cc. <span class="Ref_Italic">Madhya</span> <a href="indexf61a.html?g=125576">20.108</a>] every living being is an eternal servant of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. According to the service the living entity renders, he automatically receives benedictions from K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who does not make distinctions, thinking, &ldquo;Here is a person in an intimate relationship with Me, and here is a person I dislike.&rdquo; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a advises everyone to surrender to Him (<span class="Italic">sarva-dharm&#257;n parityajya m&#257;m eka&#7745; &#347;ara&#7751;a&#7745; vraja</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="index3a32.html?g=5997">18.66</a>]). One&rsquo;s relationship with the Supreme Lord is in proportion to that surrender and the service one renders unto the Lord. Thus throughout the entire world the higher or lower positions of the living entities are selected by the living entities themselves. If one is inclined to dictate that the Lord grant something, one receives benedictions according to his desires. If one wants to be elevated to the higher planetary systems, the heavenly planets, he can be promoted to the place he desires, and if one wants to remain a hog or a pig on earth, the Lord fulfills that desire also. Therefore, one&rsquo;s position is determined by one&rsquo;s desires; the Lord is not responsible for the higher or lower grades of our existence. This is further explained quite definitely in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index0567.html?g=3210">9.25</a>) by the Lord Himself:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">y&#257;nti deva-vrat&#257; dev&#257;n<br>pit&#7773;n y&#257;nti pit&#7771;-vrat&#257;&#7717;<br>bh&#363;t&#257;ni y&#257;nti bh&#363;tejy&#257;<br>y&#257;nti mad-y&#257;jino &rsquo;pi m&#257;m</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Some people want to be promoted to the heavenly planets, some want to be promoted to Pit&#7771;loka, and some want to remain on earth, but if one is interested in returning home, back to Godhead, he can be promoted there also. According to the demands of a particular devotee, he receives a result by the grace of the Lord. The Lord does not discriminate, thinking, &ldquo;Here is a person favorable to Me, and here is a person who is not favorable.&rdquo; Rather, He fulfills the desires of everyone. Therefore the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> enjoin:</div>

On the contrary, he asked the Lord to engage him in the service of His servant N&#257;rada Muni. This is the symptom of a pure devotee. One should serve the spiritual master first. It is not that one should bypass the spiritual master and desire to serve the Supreme Lord. This is not the principle for a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">t&#257;&#7749;dera cara&#7751;a sevi bhakta-sane v&#257;sa<br>janame janame haya, ei abhil&#257;&#7779;a</div>
<div class="After-Verse">One should not be anxious to offer direct service to the Lord. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu advised that one become a servant of the servant of the servant of the Lord (<span class="Italic">gop&#299;-bhartu&#7717; pada-kamalayor d&#257;sa-d&#257;s&#257;nud&#257;sa&#7717;</span>). This is the process for approaching the Supreme Lord. The first service should be rendered to the spiritual master so that by his mercy one can approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead to render service. While teaching R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299;, &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu said, <span class="Italic">guru-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-pras&#257;de p&#257;ya bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja:</span> one can achieve the seed of devotional service by the mercy of the <span class="Italic">guru,</span> the spiritual master, and then by the mercy of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. This is the secret of success. First one should try to please the spiritual master, and then one should attempt to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura also says, <span class="Italic">yasya pras&#257;d&#257;d bhagavat-pras&#257;do .</span> One should not attempt to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead by concoction. One must first be prepared to serve the spiritual master, and when one is qualified he is automatically offered the platform of direct service to the Lord. Therefore Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja proposed that he engage in the service of N&#257;rada Muni. He never proposed that he engage directly in the service of the Lord. This is the right conclusion. Therefore he said, <span class="Italic">so &rsquo;ha&#7745; katha&#7745; nu vis&#7771;je tava bh&#7771;tya-sev&#257;m:</span> &ldquo;How can I give up the service of my spiritual master, who has favored me in such a way that I am now able to see You face to face?&rdquo; Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja prayed to the Lord that he might continue to engage in the service of his spiritual master, N&#257;rada Muni.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">The Supreme Personality of Godhead is undoubtedly equal to everyone. He has no friend and no enemy, but as one desires benefits from the Lord, the Lord is very pleased to award them. The lower and higher positions of different living entities are due to their desires, for the Lord, being equal to all, fulfills everyone&rsquo;s desires. The killing of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu and saving of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja also strictly followed this law of the supreme controller&rsquo;s activities. When Prahl&#257;da&rsquo;s mother, this law of the supreme controller&rsquo;s activities. When Prahl&#257;da&rsquo;s mother, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu&rsquo;s wife, Kay&#257;dhu, was under the protection of N&#257;rada, she prayed for the protection of her son from the enemy, and N&#257;rada Muni gave assurance that Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja would always be saved from the enemy&rsquo;s hands. Thus when Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was going to kill Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, the Lord saved Prahl&#257;da to fulfill His promise in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">kaunteya pratij&#257;n&#299;hi na me bhakta&#7717; pra&#7751;a&#347;yati</span>) and to prove true the words of N&#257;rada. The Lord can fulfill many purposes through one action. Thus the killing of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu and the saving of Prahl&#257;da were enacted simultaneously to prove the truthfulness of the Lord&rsquo;s devotee and the fidelity of the Lord Himself to His own purpose. The Lord acts only to satisfy the desires of His devotees; otherwise He has nothing to do.

<div class="First">In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexcf5b.html?g=2550">7.10</a>) the Lord says:</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;O son of P&#7771;th&#257;, know that I am the original seed of all existences.&rdquo; In the Vedic literature it is said, <span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;&#257;v&#257;syam ida&#7745; sarvam, yato v&#257; im&#257;ni bh&#363;t&#257;ni j&#257;yante</span> and <span class="Italic">sarva&#7745; khalv ida&#7745; brahma.</span> All this Vedic information indicates that there is only one God and that there is nothing else but Him. The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers explain this in their own way, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead asserts the truth that He is everything and yet is separate from everything. This is the philosophy of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, which is called <span class="Italic">.</span> Everything is one, the Supreme Lord, yet everything is separate from the Lord. This is the understanding of oneness and difference.</div>
<div class="Purport">The example given in this regard&mdash;<span class="Italic">vasuk&#257;lavad asti-tarvo&#7717;</span>&mdash;is very easy to understand. Everything exists in time, yet there are different phases of the time factor&mdash;present, past and future. Present, past and future are one. Every day we can experience the time factor as morning, noon and evening, and although morning is different from noon, which is different from evening, all of them taken together are one. The time factor is the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the Lord is separate from the time factor. Everything is created, maintained and annihilated by time, but the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, has no beginning and no end. He is <span class="Italic">nitya&#7717; &#347;&#257;&#347;vata&#7717;</span>&mdash;eternal, permanent. Everything passes through time&rsquo;s phases of present, past and future, yet the Lord is always the same. Thus there is undoubtedly a difference between the Lord and the cosmic manifestation, but actually they are not different. Accepting them to be different is called <span class="Italic">avidy&#257;,</span> ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purport">True oneness, however, is not equivalent to the conception of the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s. The true understanding is that the differences are manifested by the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The seed is manifested as a tree, which displays varieties in its trunk, branches, leaves, flowers and fruits. &#346;r&#299;la Bhaktivinoda &#7788;h&#257;kura has therefore sung, <span class="Italic">ke&#347;ava tuy&#257; jagata vicitra:</span> &ldquo;My dear Lord, Your creation is full of varieties.&rdquo; The varieties are one and at the same time different. This is the philosophy of <span class="Italic">.</span> The conclusion given in <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> <span class="Italic"></I>[</I>Bs. </span>5.1</I>] </I>is this:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">&#299;&#347;vara&#7717; parama&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&#7717;<br>sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha&#7717;<br>an&#257;dir &#257;dir govinda&#7717;<br>sarva-k&#257;ra&#7751;a-k&#257;ra&#7751;am</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, known as Govinda, is the supreme controller. He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other origin, for He is the prime cause of all causes.&rdquo; Because the Lord is the supreme cause, everything is one with Him, but when we consider varieties, we find that one thing is different from another.</div>
<div class="Purport">We may conclude, therefore, that there is no difference between one thing and another, yet in varieties there are differences. In this regard, Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya gives an example concerning a tree and a tree in fire. Both trees are the same, but they look different because of the time factor. The time factor is under the control of the Supreme Lord, and therefore the Supreme Lord is different from time. An advanced devotee consequently does not distinguish between happiness and distress. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (10.14.8):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">tat te &rsquo;nukamp&#257;&#7745; susam&#299;k&#7779;am&#257;&#7751;o<br>bhu&ntilde;j&#257;na ev&#257;tma-k&#7771;ta&#7745; vip&#257;kam</div>
<div class="After-Verse">When a devotee is in a condition of so-called distress, he considers it a gift or blessing from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When a devotee is always thus situated in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness in any condition of life, he is described as <span class="Italic">mukti-pade sa d&#257;ya-bh&#257;k,</span> a perfect candidate for returning home, back to Godhead. The word <span class="Italic">d&#257;ya-bh&#257;k</span> means &ldquo;inheritance.&rdquo; A son inherits the property of his father. Similarly, when the devotee is fully K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious, undisturbed by dualities, he is sure that he will return home, back to Godhead, just as one inherits his father&rsquo;s property.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">This cosmic manifestation, the material world, is also Your body. This total lump of matter is agitated by Your potent energy known as k&#257;la-&#347;akti, and thus the three modes of material nature are manifested. You awaken from the bed of &#346;e&#7779;a, Ananta, and from Your navel a small transcendental seed is generated. It is from this seed that the lotus flower of the gigantic universe is manifested, exactly as a banyan tree grows from a small seed.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The three different forms of Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&mdash;namely K&#257;ra&#7751;odaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and K&#7779;&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, who are the origin of creation and maintenance&mdash;are gradually being described. From Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is generated, and from Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, K&#7779;&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u gradually expands. Thus Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is the original cause of Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and from Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u comes the lotus flower from which Lord Brahm&#257; is manifested. Thus the original cause of everything is Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and consequently the cosmic manifestation is not different from Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. This is confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index58fa.html?g=3360">10.8</a>), wherein K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says, <span class="Italic">aha&#7745; sarvasya prabhavo matta&#7717; sarva&#7745; pravartate:</span> &ldquo;I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me.&rdquo; Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is an expansion of K&#257;ra&#7751;odaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, who is an expansion of Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a. In this way, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is ultimately the cause of all causes (<span class="Italic">sarva-k&#257;ra&#7751;a-k&#257;ra&#7751;am</span> <span class="Italic"></I>[</I>Bs. </span>5.1</I>]</I>). The conclusion is that both the material world and spiritual world are considered to be the body of the Supreme Lord. We can understand that the material body is caused by the spiritual body and is therefore an expansion of the spiritual body. Thus when one takes up spiritual activities, one&rsquo;s entire material body is spiritualized. Similarly, in this material world, when the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement expands, the entire material world becomes spiritualized. As long as we do not realize this, we live in the material world, but when we are fully K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious we live not in the material world but in the spiritual world.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This is the description of the cosmic manifestation. The development of the cosmic manifestation is like the fructification of a seed. When cotton is transformed into thread, the cotton is no longer visible, and when the thread is woven into cloth, the thread is no longer visible. Similarly, it is perfectly correct that when the seed that had generated from the navel of Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u became manifested as the cosmic creation, one could no longer understand where the cause of the cosmic manifestation is. Modern scientists have tried to explain the origin of creation by a chunk theory, but no one can explain how such a chunk might have burst. The Vedic literature, however, explains clearly that the total material energy was agitated by the three modes of material nature because of the glance of the Supreme Lord. In other words, in terms of the chunk theory, the bursting of the chunk was caused by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus one must accept the supreme cause, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, as the cause of all causes.</div>

<div class="Translation">Lord Brahm&#257;, who is celebrated as &#257;tma-yoni, having been born without a mother, was struck with wonder. Thus he took shelter of the lotus flower, and when he had been purified after undergoing severe austerities for many hundreds of years, he could see that the cause of all causes, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was spread throughout his own body and senses, just as aroma, although very subtle, is perceived in the earth.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Here the statement of self-realization <span class="Italic">aha&#7745; brahm&#257;smi,</span> which is interpreted by the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da philosophy to mean &ldquo;I am the Supreme Lord,&rdquo; is explained. The Supreme Lord is the original seed of everything (<span class="Italic">janm&#257;dy asya yata&#7717;</I> [SB </I><a href="index4dab.html?g=6120">1.1.1</a></I>]</I>.</span> <span class="Italic">aha&#7745; sarvasya prabhavo matta&#7717; sarva&#7745; pravartate</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index58fa.html?g=3360">10.8</a>]). Thus the Supreme Lord extends everywhere, even throughout our bodies, because our bodies are made of material energy, which is the Lord&rsquo;s separated energy. One should realize that since the Supreme Lord spreads throughout one&rsquo;s body and since the individual soul is a part of the Supreme Lord, everything is Brahman (<span class="Italic">sarva&#7745; khalv ida&#7745; brahma</span>). This realization was achieved by Lord Brahm&#257; after he was purified, and it is possible for everyone. When one is completely in knowledge of <span class="Italic">aha&#7745; brahm&#257;smi,</span> he thinks, &ldquo;I am part of the Supreme Lord, my body is made of His material energy, and therefore I have no separate existence. Yet although the Supreme Lord is spread everywhere, He is different from me.&rdquo; This is the philosophy of <span class="Italic">acintya-bhed&#257;bheda-tattva.</span> An example given in this regard is that of the aroma within the earth. In the earth there are aromas and colors, but one cannot see them. Actually we find that when flowers grow from the earth, they appear with different colors and aromas, which they have certainly gathered from the earth, although in the earth we cannot see them. Similarly, the Supreme Lord, by His different energies, spreads throughout one&rsquo;s body and soul, although we cannot see Him. An intelligent man, however, can see the Supreme Lord existing everywhere. <span class="Italic">A&#7751;&#7693;&#257;ntara-stha-param&#257;&#7751;u-cay&#257;ntara-stham:</span> the Lord is within the universe and within the atom by His different energies. This is the real vision of the Supreme Lord for the intelligent man. Brahm&#257;, the first created being, became the most intelligent person by his <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> austerity, and thus he came to this realization. We must therefore take all knowledge from Brahm&#257;, who became perfect by his <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span></div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Lord Brahm&#257;, being completely pure, could see the original form of the Lord as Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, having many thousands of faces and forms. This process is called self-realization. Genuine self-realization consists not of perceiving the impersonal effulgence of the Lord, but seeing face to face the transcendental form of the Lord. As distinctly mentioned here, Lord Brahm&#257; saw the Supreme Lord as <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-puru&#7779;a,</span> the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Arjuna also saw K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in this same way. Therefore he told the Lord, <span class="Italic">para&#7745; brahma para&#7745; dh&#257;ma pavitra&#7745; parama&#7745; bhav&#257;n puru&#7779;a&#7745; &#347;&#257;&#347;vata&#7745; divyam:</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="index1ba6.html?g=3396">10.12</a></I>]</I> &ldquo;You are the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate, the supreme abode and purifier, the Absolute Truth and the eternal divine person.&rdquo; The Lord is <span class="Italic">parama-puru&#7779;a,</span> the supreme form. <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a&#7745; &#347;&#257;&#347;vatam:</span> He is everlastingly the supreme enjoyer. It is not that the impersonal Brahman assumes a form; on the contrary, the impersonal Brahman effulgence is an emanation from the supreme form of the Lord. Upon being purified, Brahm&#257; could see the supreme form of the Lord. The impersonal Brahman cannot have heads, noses, ears, hands and legs. This is not possible, for these are attributes of the Lord&rsquo;s form.</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;mayam</span> means &ldquo;spiritual knowledge.&rdquo; This is explained by Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya. <span class="Italic">M&#257;y&#257;maya&#7745; j&ntilde;&#257;na-svar&#363;pam.</span> The word <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;mayam,</span> describing the Lord&rsquo;s form, should not be taken to mean illusion. Rather, the Lord&rsquo;s form is factual, and seeing this form is the result of perfect knowledge. This is confirmed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;:</span> <span class="Italic">bah&#363;n&#257;&#7745; janman&#257;m ante j&ntilde;&#257;nav&#257;n m&#257;&#7745; prapadyate</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index4112.html?g=2631">7.19</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> The word <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;nav&#257;n</span> refers to one who is perfectly in knowledge. Such a person can see the Personality of Godhead, and therefore he surrenders unto the Lord. The Lord&rsquo;s being symptomized by a face, nose, ears and so on is eternal. Without such a form, no one can be blissful. The Lord, however, is <span class="Italic">sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha,</span> as stated in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra</span> (<span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;vara&#7717; parama&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&#7717; sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha&#7717; </I>[</I>Bs. </span>5.1</I>]</I>). When one is in perfect transcendental bliss, he can see the Lord&rsquo;s supreme form (<span class="Italic">vigraha</span>). In this regard, &#346;r&#299;la Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya says:</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">My dear Lord, when You appeared as Hayagr&#299;va, with the head of a horse, You killed two demons known as Madhu and Kai&#7789;abha, who were full of the modes of passion and ignorance. Then You delivered the Vedic knowledge to Lord Brahm&#257;. For this reason, all the great saints accept Your forms as transcendental, untinged by material qualities.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Supreme Personality of Godhead in His transcendental form is always ready to give protection to His devotees. As mentioned herein, the Lord in the form of Hayagr&#299;va killed two demons named Madhu and Kai&#7789;abha when they attacked Lord Brahm&#257;. Modern demons think that there was no life in the beginning of creation, but from <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> we understand that the first living creature created by the Supreme Personality of Godhead was Lord Brahm&#257;, who is full of Vedic understanding. Unfortunately, those entrusted with distributing Vedic knowledge, such as the devotees engaged in spreading K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, may sometimes be attacked by demons, but they must rest assured that demoniac attacks will not be able to harm them, for the Lord is always prepared to give them protection. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> provide the knowledge by which we can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead (<span class="Italic">vedai&#347; ca sarvair aham eva vedya&#7717;</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a>]). The devotees of the Lord are always ready to spread knowledge by which one may understand the Lord through K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, but the demons, being unable to understand the Supreme Lord, are full of ignorance and passion. Thus the Lord, whose form is transcendental, is always ready to kill the demons. By culturing the mode of goodness, one can understand the position of the transcendental Lord and how the Lord is always prepared to remove all obstacles on the path of understanding Him.</div>
<div class="Purport">In summary, whenever the Lord incarnates, He appears in His original transcendental form. As the Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexd622.html?g=1487">4.7</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">yad&#257; yad&#257; hi dharmasya<br>gl&#257;nir bhavati bh&#257;rata<br>abhyutth&#257;nam adharmasya<br>tad&#257;tm&#257;na&#7745; s&#7771;j&#257;my aham</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendent of Bh&#257;rata, and a predominant rise of irreligion&mdash;at that time I descend Myself.&rdquo; It is simply foolish to think of the Lord as being originally impersonal but accepting a material body when He appears as a personal incarnation. Whenever the Lord appears, He appears in His original transcendental form, which is spiritual and blissful. But unintelligent men, such as the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s, cannot understand the transcendental form of the Lord, and therefore the Lord chastises them by saying, <span class="Italic">avaj&#257;nanti m&#257;&#7745; m&#363;&#7693;h&#257; m&#257;nu&#7779;&#299;&#7745; tanum &#257;&#347;ritam:</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexa12b.html?g=3084">9.11</a>] &ldquo;Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form.&rdquo; Whenever the Lord appears, whether as a fish, a tortoise, a hog or any other form, one should understand that He maintains His transcendental position and that His only business, as stated here, is <span class="Italic">hatv&#257;</span>&mdash;to kill the demons. The Lord appears in order to protect the devotees and kill the demons (<span class="Italic">paritr&#257;&#7751;&#257;ya s&#257;dh&#363;n&#257;&#7745; vin&#257;&#347;&#257;ya ca du&#7779;k&#7771;t&#257;m</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexb53f.html?g=1496">4.8</a>]). Since the demons are always ready to oppose Vedic civilization, they are sure to be killed by the transcendental form of the Lord.</div>

Similarly, Lord Caitanya appeared in order to protect the fallen souls of Kali-yuga. There are four <span class="Italic">yugas,</span> or millenniums&mdash;Satya, Tret&#257;, Dv&#257;para and Kali. In all the <span class="Italic">yugas</span> but Kali-yuga, the Lord appears in various incarnations and asserts Himself as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but although Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, who appears in Kali-yuga, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He never asserted Himself as such. On the contrary, whenever &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu was addressed as being as good as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, He blocked His ears with His hands, denying His identity with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, because He was playing the part of a devotee. Lord Caitanya knew that in Kali-yuga there would be many bogus incarnations pretending to be God, and therefore He avoided asserting Himself as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu is accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, in many Vedic literatures, especially in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (11.5.32):</div>

<div class="Translation">My dear Lord, O infallible one, my position is like that of a person who has many wives, all trying to attract him in their own way. For example, the tongue is attracted to palatable dishes, the genitals to sex with an attractive woman, and the sense of touch to contact with soft things. The belly, although filled, still wants to eat more, and the ear, not attempting to hear about You, is generally attracted to cinema songs. The sense of smell is attracted to yet another side, the restless eyes are attracted to scenes of sense gratification, and the active senses are attracted elsewhere. In this way I am certainly embarrassed.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The human form of life is meant for God realization, but this process, which begins with <span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;a&#7745; k&#299;rtana&#7745; vi&#7779;&#7751;o&#7717; </I>[SB </span></I><a href="indexda76.html?g=55355">7.5.23</a>]&mdash;hearing and chanting of the holy name of the Lord&mdash;is disturbed as long as our senses are materially attracted. Therefore devotional service means purifying the senses. In the conditioned state our senses are covered by material sense gratification, and as long as one is not trained in purifying the senses, one cannot become a devotee. In our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, therefore, we advise from the very beginning that one restrict the activities of the senses, especially the tongue, which is described by &#346;r&#299;la Bhaktivinoda &#7788;h&#257;kura as most greedy and unconquerable. To stop this attraction of the tongue, one is authoritatively advised not to accept meat or similar uneatable things nor to allow the tongue to hanker to drink or smoke. Even the drinking of tea and coffee is not permitted. Similarly, the genitals must be restricted from illicit sex. Without such restraint of the senses, one cannot make advancement in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. The only method of controlling the senses is to chant and hear the holy name of the Lord; otherwise, one will always be disturbed, as a householder with more than one wife would be disturbed by them for sense gratification.</div>

<div class="Translation">O my Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, original spiritual master of the entire world, what is the difficulty for You, who manage the affairs of the universe, in delivering the fallen souls engaged in Your devotional service? You are the friend of all suffering humanity, and for great personalities it is necessary to show mercy to the foolish. Therefore I think that You will show Your causeless mercy to persons like us, who engage in Your service.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Here the words <span class="Italic">priya jan&#257;n anusevat&#257;&#7745; na&#7717;</span> indicate that the Supreme Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is very favorable to devotees who act according to the instructions of His own pure devotee. In other words, one must become the servant of the servant of the servant of the Lord. If one wants to become the servant of the Lord directly, this is not as fruitful as engaging in the service of the Lord&rsquo;s servant. This is the direction of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, who shows us the way to become <span class="Italic">gop&#299;-bhartu&#7717; pada-kamalayor d&#257;sa-d&#257;s&#257;nud&#257;sa&#7717;.</span> One should not be proud of becoming directly the servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Rather, one must seek a pure devotee, a servant of the Lord, and engage oneself in the service of such a servant. The more one becomes the servant of the servant, the more one becomes perfect in devotional service. This is also the injunction of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;:</span> <span class="Italic">eva&#7745; parampar&#257;-pr&#257;ptam ima&#7745; r&#257;jar&#7779;ayo vidu&#7717;</span> </I>[Bg. </I><a href="indexc8c3.html?g=1440">4.2</a></I>]</I><span class="Italic">.</span> One can understand the science of the Supreme Personality of Godhead simply by the <span class="Italic">parampar&#257;</span> system. In this regard, &#346;r&#299;la Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura says, <span class="Italic">t&#257;&#7749;dera cara&#7751;a sevi bhakta-sane v&#257;sa:</span> &ldquo;Let me serve the lotus feet of the devotees of the Lord, and let me live with devotees.&rdquo; <span class="Italic">Janame janame haya, ei abhil&#257;&#7779;a.</span> Following Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura, one should aspire to be a servant of the Lord&rsquo;s servant, life after life. &#346;r&#299;la Bhaktivinoda &#7788;h&#257;kura also sings, <span class="Italic">tumi ta&rsquo; &#7789;h&#257;kura, tom&#257;ra kukura, baliy&#257; j&#257;naha more:</span> &ldquo;O my Lord, O Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, please consider me your dog.&rdquo; One must become the dog of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, a pure devotee, for a pure devotee can deliver K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a without difficulty. <span class="Italic">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a se tom&#257;ra, k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a dite p&#257;ra.</span> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the property of His pure devotee, and if we take shelter of a pure devotee, he can deliver K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a very easily. Prahl&#257;da wants to engage in the service of a devotee, and therefore he prays to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, &ldquo;My dear Lord, kindly give me the shelter of Your very dear devotee so that I may engage in his service and You may then be pleased.&rdquo; <span class="Italic">Mad-bhakta-p&#363;j&#257;bhyadhik&#257;</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> 11.19.21). The Lord says, &ldquo;Engaging in the service of My devotee is better than trying to engage in My devotional service.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">Another significant point in this verse is that by devotional service Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja does not want to benefit alone. Rather, he prays to the Lord that all of us fallen souls in this material world may, by the grace of the Lord, engage in the service of His servant and thus be delivered. The grace of the Lord is not at all difficult for the Lord to bestow, and thus Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja wants to save the whole world by spreading K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself to be the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by nature.&rdquo; (Bg. <a href="index15ec.html?g=1275">3.27</a>)</div>
<div class="Purport">There is a plan for material nature, personally known as Durg&#257;, to punish the demons. Although the <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> the godless demons, struggle for existence, they are directly attacked by the goddess Durg&#257;, who is well equipped with ten hands with different types of weapons to punish them. She is carried by her lion carrier, or the modes of passion and ignorance. Everyone struggles very hard to fight through the modes of passion and ignorance and conquer material nature, but at the end everyone is vanquished by nature&rsquo;s laws.</div>
<div class="Purport">There is a river known as Vaitara&#7751;&#299; between the material and spiritual worlds, and one must cross this river to reach the other side, or the spiritual world. This is an extremely difficult task. As the Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexd990.html?g=2586">7.14</a>), <span class="Italic">daiv&#299; hy e&#7779;&#257; gu&#7751;a-may&#299; mama m&#257;y&#257; duratyay&#257;:</span> &ldquo;This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome.&rdquo; The same word <span class="Italic">duratyaya,</span> meaning &ldquo;very difficult,&rdquo; is used here. Therefore one cannot surpass the stringent laws of material nature except by the mercy of the Supreme Lord. Nonetheless, although all materialists are baffled in their plans, they try again and again to become happy in this material world. Therefore they have been described as <span class="Italic">vim&#363;&#7693;ha</span>&mdash;first-class fools. As for Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, he was not at all unhappy, for although he was in the material world, he was full of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. Those who are K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious, trying to serve the Lord, are not unhappy, whereas one who has no assets in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness and is struggling for existence is not only foolish but extremely unhappy also. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was happy and unhappy simultaneously. He felt happiness and transcendental bliss because of his being K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious, yet he felt great unhappiness for the fools and rascals who make elaborate plans to be happy in this material world.</div>

<div class="First">This is the decision of the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, the pure devotee of the Lord.

The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious person can go even to hell and still be happy. Therefore Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja said, <span class="Italic">naivodvije para duratyaya-vaitara&#7751;y&#257;&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;O best of the great personalities, I am not at all afraid of material existence.&rdquo; The pure devotee is never unhappy in any condition of life. This is confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="indexb5dd.html?g=52522">6.17.28</a>):</div>

<div class="Purport">For a devotee, being situated in the heavenly planets and being in the hellish planets are equal, for a devotee lives neither in heaven nor in hell but with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in the spiritual world.

The devotee has no such interest. He is not interested in so-called meditation in the Himalayas or the forest. Rather, his interest is in the busiest part of the world, where he teaches people K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement was started for this purpose. We do not teach one to meditate in a secluded place just so that one may show that he has become very much advanced and may be proud of his so-called transcendental meditation, although he engages in all sorts of foolish materialistic activity. A Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava like Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja is not interested in such a bluff of spiritual advancement. Rather, he is interested in enlightening people in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness because that is the only way for them to become happy. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja says clearly, <span class="Italic">n&#257;nya&#7745; tvad asya &#347;ara&#7751;a&#7745; bhramato&rsquo;nupa&#347;ye:</span> &ldquo;I know that without K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, without taking shelter of Your lotus feet, one cannot be happy.&rdquo; One wanders within the universe, life after life, but by the grace of a devotee, a servant of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, one can get the clue to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness and then not only become happy in this world but also return home, back to Godhead. That is the real target in life. The members of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement are not at all interested in so-called meditation in the Himalayas or the forest, where one will only make a show of meditation, nor are they interested in opening many schools for <span class="Italic">yoga</span> and meditation in the cities. Rather, every member of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is interested in going door to door to try to convince people about the teachings of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; As It Is,</span> the teachings of Lord Caitanya. That is the purpose of the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a movement. The members of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement must be fully convinced that without K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a one cannot be happy. Thus the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious person avoids all kinds of pseudo spiritualists, transcendentalists, meditators, monists, philosophers and philanthropists.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Sex life is compared to the rubbing of two hands to relieve an itch. G&#7771;hamedhis, so-called g&#7771;hasthas who have no spiritual knowledge, think that this itching is the greatest platform of happiness, although actually it is a source of distress. The k&#7771;pa&#7751;as, the fools who are just the opposite of br&#257;hma&#7751;as, are not satisfied by repeated sensuous enjoyment. Those who are dh&#299;ra, however, who are sober and who tolerate this itching, are not subjected to the sufferings of fools and rascals.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Materialists think that sexual indulgence is the greatest happiness in this material world, and therefore they make elaborate plans to satisfy their senses, especially the genitals. This is generally found everywhere, and specifically found in the Western world, where there are regular arrangements to satisfy sex life in different ways. Actually, however, this has not made anyone happy. Even the hippies, who have given up all the materialistic comforts of their fathers and grandfathers, cannot give up the sensational happiness of sex life. Such persons are described here as <span class="Italic">k&#7771;pa&#7751;as,</span> misers. The human form of life is a great asset, for in this life one can fulfill the goal of existence. Unfortunately, however, because of a lack of education and culture, people are victimized by the false happiness of sex life. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja therefore advises one not to be misled by this civilization of sense gratification, and especially not by sex life. Rather, one should be sober, avoid sense gratification and be K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious. The lusty person, who is compared to a foolish miser, never gets happiness by sense gratification. The influence of material nature is very difficult to surpass, but as stated by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexd990.html?g=2586">7.14</a>), <span class="Italic">m&#257;m eva ye prapadyante, m&#257;y&#257;m et&#257;&#7745; taranti te:</span> if one voluntarily submits to the lotus feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, he can be saved very easily.</div>

<div class="Translation">O Supreme Personality of Godhead, there are ten prescribed methods on the path to liberation&mdash;to remain silent, not to speak to anyone, to observe vows, to amass all kinds of Vedic knowledge, to undergo austerities, to study the Vedas and other Vedic literatures, to execute the duties of var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma, to explain the &#347;&#257;stras, to stay in a solitary place, to chant mantras silently, and to be absorbed in trance. These different methods for liberation are generally only a professional practice and means of livelihood for those who have not conquered their senses. Because such persons are falsely proud, these procedures may not be successful.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="index2fef.html?g=46639">6.1.15</a>):</div>

He can do this simply by discharging devotional service, just as the sun can immediately dissipate fog by its rays.&rdquo; The real purpose of human life is to attain liberation from material entanglement. Such liberation may be achieved by many methods (<span class="Italic">tapas&#257; brahmacarye&#7751;a &#347;amena ca damena ca</I> [SB </span></I><a href="index22f6.html?g=46626">6.1.13</a>]), but all of them more or less depend on <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> austerity, which begins with celibacy. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; says that those who are <span class="Italic">v&#257;sudeva-par&#257;ya&#7751;a,</span> who have fully surrendered to the lotus feet of Lord V&#257;sudeva, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, automatically achieve the results of <span class="Italic">mauna</span> (silence), <span class="Italic">vrata</span> (vows) and other such methods simply by discharging devotional service. In other words, these methods are not so powerful. If one takes to devotional service, all of them are very easily performed.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Mauna,</span> for example, does not mean that one should just stop speaking. The tongue is meant for speaking, although sometimes, to make a big show, a person remains silent. There are many who observe silence some day in a week. Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas, however, do not observe such silence. Silence means not speaking foolishly. Speakers at assemblies, conferences and meetings generally speak foolishly like toads. This is described by &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; as <span class="Italic">v&#257;co vegam.</span> One who wants to say something can show himself to be a big orator, but rather than go on speaking nonsense, better to remain silent. This method of silence, therefore, is recommended for persons very attached to speaking nonsense. One who is not a devotee must speak nonsensically because he does not have the power to speak about the glories of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Thus whatever he says is influenced by the illusory energy and is compared to the croaking of a frog. One who speaks about the glories of the Lord, however, has no need to be silent. Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu recommends, <span class="Italic">k&#299;rtan&#299;ya&#7717; sad&#257; hari&#7717;:</span></I> [Cc. adi </I><a href="index5365.html?g=93806">17.31</a></I>]</I> one should go on chanting the glories of the Lord twenty-four hours a day.

Therefore unless one is extremely advanced in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, one should not imitate Harid&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura, who had no other business than chanting the holy name always, twenty-four hours a day. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja does not condemn such a process; he accepts it, but without active service to the Lord, simply by such methods one generally cannot attain liberation. One cannot attain liberation simply by false pride.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This chapter describes how the Supreme Personality of Godhead N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva disappeared, after pleasing Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. It also describes a benediction given by Lord &#346;iva.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva wanted to bestow benedictions upon Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, one after another, but Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, thinking them impediments on the path of spiritual progress, did not accept any of them. Instead, he fully surrendered at the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet. He said: &ldquo;If anyone engaged in the devotional service of the Lord prays for personal sense gratification, he cannot be called a pure devotee or even a devotee. He may be called only a merchant engaged in the business of give and take. Similarly, a master who wants to please his servant after taking service from him is also not a real master.&rdquo; Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, therefore, did not ask anything from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Rather, he said that if the Lord wanted to give him a benediction, he wanted the Lord to assure him that he would never be induced to take any benedictions for the sake of material desires. Exchanges of devotional service for lusty desires are always very prominent. As soon as lusty desires awaken, one&rsquo;s senses, mind, life, soul, religious principles, patience, intelligence, shyness, beauty, strength, memory and truthfulness are all vanquished. One can render unalloyed devotional service only when there are no material desires in one&rsquo;s mind.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The Supreme Personality of Godhead was greatly pleased with Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja for his unalloyed devotion, yet the Lord provided him one material benediction&mdash;that he would be perfectly happy in this world and live his next life in Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha. The Lord gave him the benediction that he would be the king of this material world until the end of the <span class="Italic">manvantara</span> millennium and that although in this material world, he would have the facility to hear the glories of the Lord and depend fully on the Lord, performing service to Him in uncontaminated <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> The Lord advised Prahl&#257;da to perform sacrifices through <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> for this is the duty of a king.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja accepted whatever the Lord had offered him, and he prayed for the Lord to deliver his father. In response to this prayer, the Lord assured him that in the family of such a pure devotee as he, not only the devotee&rsquo;s father but his forefathers for twenty-one generations are liberated. The Lord also asked Prahl&#257;da to perform the ritualistic ceremonies appropriate after his father&rsquo;s death.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Then Lord Brahm&#257;, who was also present, offered many prayers to the Lord, expressing his obligation to the Lord for having offered benedictions to Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. The Lord advised Lord Brahm&#257; not to offer benedictions to <span class="Italic">asuras</span> as he had to Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, for such benedictions indulge them. Then Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva disappeared. On that day, Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was installed on the throne of the world by Lord Brahm&#257; and &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Thus N&#257;rada Muni described the character of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja for Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, and he further described the killing of R&#257;va&#7751;a by Lord R&#257;macandra and the killing of &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la and Dantavakra in Dv&#257;para-yuga. &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la, of course, had merged into the existence of the Lord and thus achieved <span class="Italic">s&#257;yujya-mukti.</span> N&#257;rada Muni praised Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira Mah&#257;r&#257;ja because the Supreme Lord, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, was the greatest well-wisher and friend of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas and almost always stayed in their house. Thus the fortune of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas was greater than that of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level"><TB>Later, N&#257;rada Muni described how the demon Maya D&#257;nava constructed Tripura for the demons, who became very powerful and defeated the demigods. Because of this defeat, Lord Rudra, &#346;iva, dismantled Tripura; thus he became famous as Tripur&#257;ri. For this, Rudra is very much appreciated and worshiped by the demigods.

<div class="First">Materialistic life means attachment to the body and everything in relationship to the body. This attachment is based on lusty desires for sense gratification, specifically sexual enjoyment. <span class="Italic">K&#257;mais tais tair h&#7771;ta-j&ntilde;&#257;n&#257;&#7717;: </I>[Bg. </I></span><a href="indexda67.html?g=2640">7.20</a>] when one is too attached to material enjoyment, he is bereft of all knowledge (<span class="Italic">h&#7771;ta j&ntilde;&#257;n&#257;&#7717;</span>). As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> those who are attached to material enjoyment are mostly inclined to worship the demigods to procure various material opulences. They are especially attached to worship of the goddess Durg&#257; and Lord &#346;iva because this transcendental couple can offer their devotees all material opulence. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, however, was detached from all material enjoyment. He therefore took shelter of the lotus feet of Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva, and not the feet of any demigod.

Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, however, was very careful in this regard.

A <span class="Italic">nitya-siddha</span> devotee comes from Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha upon the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and shows by his example how to become a pure devotee (<span class="Italic">any&#257;bhil&#257;&#7779;it&#257;-&#347;&#363;nyam </I>[</span><span class="Ref_Italic"></B></I>Bhakti-ras&#257;m&#7771;ta-sindhu </span></B><PW:Popup,5.70833,2.72917,Popup><div class="Verse">any&#257;bhil&#257;&#7779;it&#257;-&#347;&#363;nya&#7745;<br>j&ntilde;&#257;na-karm&#257;dy-an&#257;v&#7771;tam<br>&#257;nuk&#363;lyena k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;&#257;nu-<br>&#347;&#299;lana&#7745; bhaktir uttam&#257;</div></div>

In spite of coming to this material world, the <span class="Italic">nitya-siddha</span> devotee is never attracted by the allurements of material enjoyment. A perfect example is Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, who was a <span class="Italic">nitya-siddha,</span> a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata</span> devotee. Although Prahl&#257;da was born in the family of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, an atheist, he was never attached to any kind of materialistic enjoyment. Desiring to exhibit the symptoms of a pure devotee, the Lord tried to induce Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja to take material benedictions, but Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja did not accept them. On the contrary, by his personal example he showed the symptoms of a pure devotee. In other words, the Lord Himself has no desire to send His pure devotee to this material world, nor does a devotee have any material purpose in coming. When the Lord Himself appears as an incarnation within this material world, He is not allured by the material atmosphere, and He has nothing to do with material activity, yet by His example He teaches the common man how to become a devotee. Similarly, a devotee who comes here in accordance with the order of the Supreme Lord shows by his personal behavior how to become a pure devotee. A pure devotee, therefore, is a practical example for all living entities, including Lord Brahm&#257;.</div>

<div class="First">It is sometimes found that one comes to a devotee or a temple of the Lord just to get some material benefit. Such a person is described here as a mercantile man. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> speaks of <span class="Italic">&#257;rto jij&ntilde;&#257;sur arth&#257;rth&#299;.</span> The word <span class="Italic">&#257;rta</span> refers to one who is physically distressed, and <span class="Italic">arth&#257;rth&#299;</span> refers to one in need of money.

They have been described as <span class="Italic">suk&#7771;t&#299;,</span> pious, because in their distress or need for money they have approached the Supreme Lord. Unless one is pious, one cannot approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead. However, although a pious man may receive some material benefit, one who is concerned with material benefits cannot be a pure devotee. When a pure devotee receives material opulences, this is not because of his pious activity but for the service of the Lord. When one engages in devotional service, one is automatically pious. Therefore, a pure devotee is <span class="Italic">any&#257;bhil&#257;&#7779;it&#257;-&#347;&#363;nyam </I>[</B></I></span><span class="Ref_Italic">Bhakti-ras&#257;m&#7771;ta-sindhu </B></span>1.1.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> He has no desire for material profit, nor does the Lord induce him to try to profit materially.

<div class="Purport">Sometimes materialists go to a temple to offer flowers and fruit to the Lord because they have learned from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> that if a devotee offers some flowers and fruits, the Lord accepts them. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index8855.html?g=3219">9.26</a>) the Lord says:</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it.&rdquo; Thus a man with a mercantile mentality thinks that if he can get some material benefit, like a large amount of money, simply by offering a little fruit and flower, this is good business. Such persons are not accepted as pure devotees. Because their desires are not purified, they are still mercantile men, even though they go to temples to make a show of being devotees. <span class="Italic">Sarvop&#257;dhi-vinirmukta&#7745; tat-paratvena nirmalam:</span></I> [Cc.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexda67.html?g=2640">7.20</a>), <span class="Italic">k&#257;mais tais tair h&#7771;ta j&ntilde;&#257;n&#257;&#7717; prapadyante &rsquo;nya-devat&#257;&#7717;.</span> &ldquo;Those whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods.&rdquo; A demigod cannot become master, for the real master is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The demigods, to keep their prestigious positions, bestow upon their worshipers whatever benedictions the worshipers want. For example, once it was found that an <span class="Italic">asura</span> took a benediction from Lord &#346;iva by which the <span class="Italic">asura</span> would be able to kill someone simply by placing his hands on that person&rsquo;s head. Such benedictions are possible to receive from the demigods. If one worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, the Lord will never offer him such condemned benedictions. On the contrary, it is said in the <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (10.88.8), <span class="Italic">yasy&#257;ham anug&#7771;hn&#257;mi hari&#7779;ye tad-dhana&#7745; &#347;anai&#7717;.</span> If one is too materialistic but at the same time wants to be a servant of the Supreme Lord, the Lord, because of His supreme compassion for the devotee, takes away all his material opulences and obliges him to be a pure devotee of the Lord. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja distinguishes between the pure devotee and the pure master. The Lord is the pure master, the supreme master, whereas an unalloyed devotee with no material motives is the pure servant. One who has materialistic motivations cannot become a servant, and one who unnecessarily bestows benedictions upon his servant to keep his own prestigious position is not a real master.</div>

<div class="Translation">The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Prahl&#257;da, a devotee like you never desires any kind of material opulences, either in this life or in the next.

<div class="First">One Manu lives for a duration of time calculated to be an aggregate of seventy-one <span class="Italic">yuga</span> cycles, each of which equals 4,300,000 years. Although atheistic men like to enjoy material opulences and they endeavor with great energy to build big residences, roads, cities and factories, unfortunately they cannot live more than eighty, ninety or at the utmost one hundred years. Although the materialist exerts so much energy to create a kingdom of hallucinations, he is unable to enjoy it for more than a few years. However, because Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was a devotee, the Lord allowed him to enjoy material opulence as the king of the materialists. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja had taken birth in the family of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, who was the topmost materialist, and since Prahl&#257;da was the bona fide heir of his father, the Supreme Lord allowed him to enjoy the kingdom created by his father for so many years that no materialist could calculate them. A devotee does not have to desire material opulence, but if he is a pure devotee, there is ample opportunity for him to enjoy material happiness also, without personal endeavor. Therefore, everyone is advised to take to devotional service under all circumstances. If one desires material opulence, he can also become a pure devotee, and his desires will be fulfilled.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">When a devotee becomes materially very opulent, one should not think that he is enjoying the results of his fruitive activities. A devotee in this material world uses all material opulences for the service of the Lord because he is planning how to serve the Lord with these opulences, as advised by the Lord Himself. Whatever material opulence is within his possession he engages to expand the glories and service of the Lord. A devotee never performs any fruitive or ritualistic ceremony to enjoy the results of such <span class="Italic">karma.</span> Rather, a devotee knows that <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</span> is meant for the less intelligent man.

<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">ku&#347;alena</span> is very important. One should live in the material world very expertly.

Thus even when performing devotional service a devotee has to create many enemies. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja himself had experience of this, for even his father became his enemy. A devotee should expertly manage to think always of the Supreme Lord so that the reactions of suffering cannot touch him.

Thus when a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava takes birth in a family, by the grace of the Lord he purifies not only that family but also the families of his previous births.</div>

<div class="First">In <span class="Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta,</span> in connection with Lord Caitanya&rsquo;s instructions to San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299;, it is explained that a devotee should externally execute his routine devotional service in a regular way but should always inwardly think of the particular mellow in which he is attracted to the service of the Lord. This constant thought of the Lord makes the devotee eligible to return home, back to Godhead. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexe89d.html?g=1505">4.9</a>), <span class="Italic">tyaktv&#257; deha&#7745; punar janma naiti m&#257;m eti:</span> after giving up his body, a devotee does not again receive a material body, but goes back to Godhead and receives a spiritual body resembling those of the Lord&rsquo;s eternal associates whose activities he followed.

Because of constantly thinking of these features, one acquires a transcendental position. Kings like &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la, Dantavakra, Ka&#7745;sa, Pau&#7751;&#7693;raka, Narak&#257;sura and S&#257;lva were all similarly delivered. This is confirmed by Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya:</div>

<div class="Purport">The demon Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu had so many ways to try to become God himself, but although Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was chastised and threatened in many ways, he rigidly refused to accept his powerful demoniac father as God. Following in the footsteps of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, we should reject all the rascals who pretend to be God. We must accept K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and His incarnations, and no one else.</div>

<div class="First">After hearing about the activities of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, a pure devotee should be very anxious to follow in his footsteps, but such a devotee might be disappointed, thinking that not every devotee can come to the standard of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. This is the nature of a pure devotee; he always thinks himself to be the lowest, to be incompetent and unqualified. Thus after hearing the narration of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s activities, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, who was on the same standard of devotional service as Prahl&#257;da, might have been thinking of his own humble position. N&#257;rada Muni, however, could understand Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira&rsquo;s mind, and therefore he immediately encouraged him by saying that the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas were not less fortunate; they were as good as Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja because although Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva appeared for Prahl&#257;da, the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His original form as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was always living with the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas.

<div class="Purport">Any pure devotee who is constantly conscious of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is naturally very fortunate. The word <span class="Italic">n&#7771;-loke,</span> meaning &ldquo;within the material world,&rdquo; indicates that before the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas there had been many, many devotees, such as the descendants of the Yadu dynasty and Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha, Mar&#299;ci, Ka&#347;yapa, Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord &#346;iva, who were all extremely fortunate. The P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, however, were better than all of them because K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself lived with them constantly.

<div class="First">The <span class="Italic">asuras</span> are generally extremely powerful because of their mystic yogic power. However, as Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexfcdb.html?g=2458">6.47</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">yogin&#257;m api sarve&#7779;&#257;&#7745;<br>mad-gaten&#257;ntar&#257;tman&#257;<br>&#347;raddh&#257;v&#257;n bhajate yo m&#257;&#7745;<br>sa me yuktatamo mata&#7717;</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Of all <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s,</span> he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in <span class="Italic">yoga</span> and is the highest of all.&rdquo; The actual purpose of mystic <span class="Italic">yoga</span> is to concentrate one&rsquo;s attention fully on the Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and always think of Him (<span class="Italic">mad-gaten&#257;ntar&#257;tman&#257;</span>). To attain such perfection, one must undergo a certain process&mdash;<span class="Italic">ha&#7789;ha-yoga</span>&mdash;and through this <span class="Italic">yoga</span> system the practitioner achieves some uncommon mystic power. The <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> however, instead of becoming devotees of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, utilize this mystic power for their personal sense gratification. Maya D&#257;nava, for example, is mentioned here as <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-yog&#299;,</span> a great mystic, but his business was to help the <span class="Italic">asuras.</span> Nowadays we are actually seeing that there are some <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> who cater to the senses of materialists, and there are imposters who advertise themselves as God. Maya D&#257;nava was such a person, a god among the demons, and he could perform some wonderful feats, one of which is described here: he made a well filled with nectar and dipped the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> into that nectarean well. This nectar was known as <span class="Italic">m&#7771;ta-sanj&#299;vayitari,</span> for it could bring a dead body to life. <span class="Italic">M&#7771;ta-sanj&#299;vayitari</span> is also an &#256;yur-vedic preparation. It is a kind of liquor that invigorates even a person on the verge of death.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This chapter describes the general principles by following which a human being, and specifically one who is interested in advancing in spiritual life, can become perfect.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">By hearing about the characteristics of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira became extremely pleased. Now he inquired from N&#257;rada Muni about the actual religion of a human being and about special characteristics of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma,</span> which marks the highest status of human civilization. When Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira asked N&#257;rada Muni about these matters, N&#257;rada Muni stopped giving his own statements and quoted statements by Lord N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, for He is the supreme authority for giving religious codes (<span class="Italic">dharma&#7745; tu s&#257;k&#7779;&#257;d bhagavat-pra&#7751;&#299;tam</I> [SB </span></I><a href="index9092.html?g=47669">6.3.19</a>]). Every human being is expected to acquire thirty qualities, such as truthfulness, mercy and austerity. The process of following the priniples of religion is known as <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana-dharma,</span> the eternal religious system.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</span> system delineates the divisions of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a, k&#7779;atriya, vai&#347;ya</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra.</span> It also sets forth the system of <span class="Italic">sa&#7745;sk&#257;ras.</span> The <span class="Italic">garbh&#257;dh&#257;na sa&#7745;sk&#257;ra,</span> the ceremony for begetting a child, must be observed by the higher section of people, namely the <span class="Italic">dvijas.</span> One who follows the <span class="Italic">garbh&#257;dh&#257;na sa&#7745;sk&#257;ra</span> system is actually twice-born, but those who do not, who deviate from the principles of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma,</span> are called <span class="Italic">dvija-bandhus.</span> The principal occupations for a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> are worshiping the Deity, teaching others how to worship the Deity, studying the Vedic literatures, teaching the Vedic literatures, accepting charity from others and again giving charity to others. A <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> should make his livelihood from these six occupational duties. The duty of a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> is to give protection to the citizens and levy taxes upon them, but he is forbidden to tax the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> The members of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement should therefore be exempt from government taxation. <span class="Italic">K&#7779;atriyas</span> may tax everyone but the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> <span class="Italic">Vai&#347;yas</span> should cultivate the land, produce food grains and protect the cows, whereas the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras,</span> who by quality never become <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as, k&#7779;atriyas</span> or <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas,</span> should serve the three higher classes and be satisfied. Other means of livelihood are also prescribed for the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> and these are four&mdash;<span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;l&#299;na, y&#257;y&#257;vara, &#347;ila,</span> and <span class="Italic">u&ntilde;chana.</span> Each of these occupational duties is successively better.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">One who is in a lower grade of social life cannot accept the profession of a higher class unless necessary. In times of emergency, all the classes but the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> may accept professional duties of others. The means of livelihood known as <span class="Italic">&#7771;ta</span> (<span class="Italic">&#347;ilo&ntilde;chana</span>), <span class="Italic">am&#7771;ta</span> (<span class="Italic">ay&#257;cita</span>), <span class="Italic">m&#7771;ta</span> (<span class="Italic">y&#257;c&ntilde;&#257;</span>), <span class="Italic">pram&#7771;ta</span> (<span class="Italic">kar&#7779;a&#7751;a</span>), and <span class="Italic">saty&#257;n&#7771;ta</span> (<span class="Italic">v&#257;&#7751;ijya</span>) may be accepted by everyone but the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas.</span> For a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> or a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya,</span> engaging in the service of the <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas</span> or <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> is considered the profession of dogs.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">N&#257;rada Muni also described that the symptom of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> is controlled senses, the symptoms of a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> are power and fame, the symptom of a <span class="Italic">vai&#347;ya</span> is service to the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas,</span> and the symptom of a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> is service to the three higher classes. The qualification for a woman is to be a very faithful and chaste wife. In this way, N&#257;rada Muni described the characteristics of higher and lower grades of people and recommended that one follow the principles of his caste or his hereditary occupation. One cannot suddenly give up a profession to which he is accustomed, and therefore it is recommended that one gradually be awakened. The symptoms of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as, k&#7779;atriyas, vai&#347;yas,</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> are very important, and therefore one should be designated only by these symptoms, and not by birth. Designation by birth is strictly forbidden by N&#257;rada Muni and all great personalities.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"><span class="Italic">San&#257;tana-dharma</span> means devotional service. The word <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana</span> refers to that which is eternal, which does not change but continues in all circumstances. We have several times explained what the eternal occupational duty of the living being is. Indeed, it has been explained by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. <span class="Italic">J&#299;vera &lsquo;svar&#363;pa&rsquo; haya&mdash;k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;era &lsquo;nitya-d&#257;sa&rsquo;: </I>[</span></I>Cc. <span class="Ref_Italic">Madhya</span> <a href="indexf61a.html?g=125576">20.108</a>] the real occupational duty of the living entity is to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even if one prefers to deviate from this principle he remains a servant because that is his eternal position; but one serves <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> the illusory, material energy. The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, therefore, is an attempt to guide human society to serving the Personality of Godhead instead of serving the material world with no real profit. Our actual experience is that every man, animal, bird and beast&mdash;indeed, every living entity&mdash;is engaged in rendering service. Even though one&rsquo;s body or one&rsquo;s superficial religion may change, every living entity is always engaged in the service of someone. Therefore, the mentality of service is called the eternal occupational duty. This eternal occupational duty can be organized through the institution of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama,</span> in which there are four <span class="Italic">var&#7751;as</span> (<span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a, k&#7779;atriya, vai&#347;ya</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span>) and four <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;ramas</span> (<span class="Italic">brahmacarya, g&#7771;hastha, v&#257;naprastha</span> and <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span>). Thus, Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira Mah&#257;r&#257;ja inquired from N&#257;rada Muni about the principles of <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana-dharma</span> for the benefit of human society.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">These are the general principles to be followed by all human beings: truthfulness, mercy, austerity (observing fasts on certain days of the month), bathing twice a day, tolerance, discrimination between right and wrong, control of the mind, control of the senses, nonviolence, celibacy, charity, reading of scripture, simplicity, satisfaction, rendering service to saintly persons, gradually taking leave of unnecessary engagements, observing the futility of the unnecessary activities of human society, remaining silent and grave and avoiding unnecessary talk, considering whether one is the body or the soul, distributing food equally to all living entities (both men and animals), seeing every soul (especially in the human form) as a part of the Supreme Lord, hearing about the activities and instructions given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead (who is the shelter of the saintly persons), chanting about these activities and instructions, always remembering these activities and instructions, trying to render service, performing worship, offering obeisances, becoming a servant, becoming a friend, and surrendering one&rsquo;s whole self. O King Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, these thirty qualifications must be acquired in the human form of life. Simply by acquiring these qualifications, one can satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In order that human beings be distinct from the animals, the great saint N&#257;rada recommends that every human being be educated in terms of the above-mentioned thirty qualifications. Nowadays there is propaganda everywhere, all over the world, for a secular state, a state interested only in mundane activities. But if the citizens of the state are not educated in the above-mentioned good qualities, how can there be happiness? For example, if the total populace is untruthful, how can the state be happy? Therefore, without consideration of one&rsquo;s belonging to a sectarian religion, whether Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist or any other sect, everyone should be taught to become truthful. Similarly, everyone should be taught to be merciful, and everyone should observe fasting on certain days of the month. Everyone should bathe twice a day, cleanse his teeth and body externally, and cleanse his mind internally by remembering the holy name of the Lord. The Lord is one, whether one is Hindu, Muslim or Christian. Therefore, one should chant the holy name of the Lord, regardless of differences in linguistic pronunciation. Also, everyone should be taught to be very careful not to discharge semen unnecessarily. This is very important for all human beings. If semen is not discharged unnecessarily, one becomes extremely strong in memory, determination, activity and the vitality of one&rsquo;s bodily energy. Everyone should also be taught to be simple in thought and feeling and satisfied in body and mind. These are the general qualifications of a human being. There is no question of a secular state or an ecclesiastical state. Unless one is educated in the above-mentioned thirty qualities, there cannot be any peace. Ultimately it is recommended:</div>

<div class="Translation">Those who have been reformed by the garbh&#257;dh&#257;na ceremony and other prescribed reformatory methods, performed with Vedic mantras and without interruption, and who have been approved by Lord Brahm&#257;, are dvijas, or twice-born. Such br&#257;hma&#7751;as, k&#7779;atriyas and vai&#347;yas, purified by their family traditions and by their behavior, should worship the Lord, study the Vedas and give charity. In this system, they should follow the principles of the four &#257;&#347;ramas [brahmacarya, g&#7771;hastha, v&#257;naprastha and sanny&#257;sa].</div>

<div class="First">After giving a general list of thirty qualifications for one&rsquo;s behavior, N&#257;rada Muni now describes the principles of the four <span class="Italic">var&#7751;as</span> and four <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;ramas.</span> A human being must be trained in the above-mentioned thirty qualities; otherwise, he is not even a human being. Then, among such qualified persons, the <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</span> process should be introduced. In the <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</span> system, the first ceremony for purification is <span class="Italic">garbh&#257;dh&#257;na,</span> which is performed with <span class="Italic">mantras</span> at the time of sex for propagating a good child. One who uses sex life not for sensual pleasures but only to beget children according to the reformatory method is also accepted as a <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;.</span> One should not waste semen on sensual pleasure, violating the principles of Vedic life. Restraint in sex is possible, however, only when the populace is trained in the above-mentioned thirty qualities; otherwise, it is not possible. Even if one is born in a family of <span class="Italic">dvijas,</span> or twice-born, if they have not followed the reformatory process he is called a <span class="Italic">dvija-bandhu</span>&mdash;not one of the twice-born, but a friend of the twice-born. The whole purpose of this system is to create good population. As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> when women are polluted the populace is <span class="Italic">var&#7751;a-sa&#7749;kara,</span> and when the <span class="Italic">var&#7751;a-sa&#7749;kara</span> population increases, the situation of the entire world becomes hellish. Therefore, all the Vedic literatures strongly warn against creating <span class="Italic">var&#7751;a-sa&#7749;kara</span> population. When there is <span class="Italic">var&#7751;a-sa&#7749;kara</span> population, the people cannot be properly controlled for peace and prosperity, regardless of great legislative assemblies, parliaments and similar bodies.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">It is very important for peaceful householder life that a woman follow the vow of her husband. Any disagreement with the husband&rsquo;s vow will disrupt family life. In this regard, C&#257;&#7751;akya Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita gives a very valuable instruction: <span class="Italic">dampatyo&#7717; kalaho n&#257;sti tatra &#347;r&#299;&#7717; svayam &#257;gat&#257;&#7717;.</span> When there are no fights between husband and wife, the goddess of fortune automatically comes to the home. A woman&rsquo;s education should be conducted along the lines indicated in this verse. The basic principle for a chaste woman is to be always favorably disposed toward her husband. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexddc4.html?g=327">1.40</a>) it is said, <span class="Italic">str&#299;&#7779;u du&#7779;&#7789;&#257;su v&#257;r&#7779;&#7751;eya j&#257;yate var&#7751;a-sa&#7749;kara&#7717;:</span> if the women are polluted, there will be <span class="Italic">var&#7751;a-sa&#7749;kara</span> population. In modern terms, the <span class="Italic">var&#7751;a-sa&#7749;kara</span> are the hippies, who do not follow any regulative injunctions. Another explanation is that when the population is <span class="Italic">var&#7751;a-sa&#7749;kara,</span> no one can know who is on what platform. The <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</span> system scientifically divides society into four <span class="Italic">var&#7751;as</span> and four <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;ramas,</span> but in <span class="Italic">var&#7751;a-sa&#7749;kara</span> society there are no such distinctions, and no one can know who is who. In such a society, no one can distinguish between a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya,</span> a <span class="Italic">vai&#347;ya</span> and a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra.</span> For peace and happiness in the material world, the <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</span> institution must be introduced.

A fallen husband is one who is addicted to the four principles of sinful activity&mdash;namely illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling and intoxication. Specifically, if one is not a soul surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is understood to be contaminated. Thus a chaste woman is advised not to agree to serve such a husband. It is not that a chaste woman should be like a slave while her husband is <span class="Italic">nar&#257;dhama,</span> the lowest of men. Although the duties of a woman are different from those of a man, a chaste woman is not meant to serve a fallen husband. If her husband is fallen, it is recommended that she give up his association. Giving up the association of her husband does not mean, however, that a woman should marry again and thus indulge in prostitution. If a chaste woman unfortunately marries a husband who is fallen, she should live separately from him. Similarly, a husband can separate himself from a woman who is not chaste according to the description of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra.</span> The conclusion is that a husband should be a pure Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava and that a woman should be a chaste wife with all the symptoms described in this regard.

For example, if a tiger kills a man, this is not sinful but if a man kills another man, this is considered sinful, and the killer is hanged. What is a daily affair among the animals is a sinful act in human society. Thus according to the symptoms of higher and lower sections of society, there are different varieties of occupational duties. According to the experts in Vedic knowledge, these duties are prescribed in terms of the age concerned.</div>

One who has attained the qualifications of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> regardless of where he was born, should be accepted as a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> Similarly, if one has developed the qualities of a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> or a <span class="Italic">ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la,</span> regardless of where he was born, he should be accepted in terms of those symptoms.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;ri</span> should live under the care of the true spiritual master, giving him sincere respect and obeisances, acting as his menial servant, and always carrying out his order. The <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> should engage himself in spiritual activities and study the Vedic literature under the direction of the spiritual master. According to the <span class="Italic">brahmacarya</span> system, he should dress with a belt, deerskin, and matted hair and should bear a <span class="Italic">da&#7751;&#7693;a,</span> waterpot and sacred thread. He should collect alms daily in the morning, and in the evening whatever alms he has collected he should offer to the spiritual master. A <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> should accept <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da</span> upon the order of the spiritual master, and if the spiritual master sometimes forgets to order the disciple to eat, the disciple should not take <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da</span> on his own initiative; rather, he should fast. The <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> should be trained to be satisfied with eating what is absolutely necessary, he should be very expert in executing responsibilities, he should be faithful, and he should control his senses and try to avoid the association of women as far as possible. A <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> should very strictly abstain from living with women and should not meet with <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hasthas</span> and those too addicted to women.

Indeed, the whole purpose of Vedic life is to become free from sexual indulgence. All the <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;ramas</span> are recognized for spiritual progress, and therefore although the <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha-&#257;&#347;rama</span> gives a kind of license for sex life for a certain time, it does not allow unrestricted sex life. Therefore, in <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> life also, there is no illicit sex. A <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> should not accept a woman for sexual enjoyment.

Nor should he cook food with fire, although he is allowed to eat <span class="Italic">caru,</span> grains that have been offered in a sacrificial fire. He may also eat fruits and grains that have grown naturally. Living in a thatched cottage, the <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha</span> should endure all kinds of heat and cold. He should not cut his nails or hair, and he should give up cleaning his body and teeth. He should wear tree bark, accept a <span class="Italic">da&#7751;&#7693;a,</span> and practice life in the forest, taking a vow to live there for twelve years, eight years, four years, two years or at least one year. At last, when because of old age he can no longer perform the activities of a <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha,</span> he should gradually stop everything and in this way give up his body.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The relationship between the student or disciple and the wife of the spiritual master or teacher is like that between son and mother. A mother sometimes cares for her son by combing his hair, massaging his body with oil, or bathing him. Similarly, the wife of the teacher is also a mother (<span class="Italic">guru-patn&#299;</span>), and therefore she may also care for the disciple in a motherly way. If the wife of the teacher is a young woman, however, a young <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> should not allow such a mother to touch him. This is strictly prohibited. There are seven kinds of mothers:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">&#257;tma-m&#257;t&#257; guro&#7717; patn&#299;<br>br&#257;hma&#7751;&#299; r&#257;ja-patnik&#257;<br>dhenur dh&#257;tr&#299; tath&#257; p&#7771;thv&#299;<br>saptait&#257; m&#257;tara&#7717; sm&#7771;t&#257;&#7717;</div>
<div class="After-Verse">These mothers are the original mother, the wife of the teacher or spiritual master, the wife of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> the king&rsquo;s wife, the cow, the nurse and the earth. Unnecessary association with women, even with one&rsquo;s mother, sister or daughter, is strictly prohibited. This is human civilization. A civilization that allows men to mix unrestrictedly with women is an animal civilization. In Kali-yuga, people are extremely liberal, but mixing with women and talking with them as equals actually constitutes an uncivilized way of life.</div>

<div class="First">If a butter pot and fire are kept together, the butter within the pot will certainly melt. Woman is compared to fire, and man is compared to a butter pot. However advanced one may be in restraining the senses, it is almost impossible for a man to keep himself controlled in the presence of a woman, even if she is his own daughter, mother or sister. Indeed, his mind is agitated even if one is in the renounced order of life. Therefore, Vedic civilization carefully restricts mingling between men and women. If one cannot understand the basic principle of restraining association between man and woman, he is to be considered an animal. That is the purport of this verse.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Here is another important warning that a man must save himself from attraction to woman. Until one is self-realized, fully independent of the illusory conception of the material body, the duality of man and woman must undoubtedly continue, but when one is actually self-realized this distinction ceases.</div>

This is the test of self-realization. One must realize perfectly that the living being is spirit soul but is tasting various types of material bodies. One may theoretically understand this, but when one has practical realization, then he actually becomes a <span class="Italic">pa&#7751;&#7693;ita,</span> one who knows. Until that time, the duality continues, and the conception of man and woman also continues. In this stage, one should be extremely careful about mixing with women. No one should think himself perfect and forget the &#347;&#257;stric instruction that one should be very careful about associating even with his daughter, mother or sister, not to speak of other women. &#346;r&#299;la Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya cites the following <span class="Italic">&#347;lokas</span> in this regard:</div>

<div class="Translation">All the rules and regulations apply equally to the householder and the sanny&#257;s&#299;, the member of the renounced order of life. The g&#7771;hastha, however, is given permission by the spiritual master to indulge in sex during the period favorable for procreation.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">It is sometimes misunderstood that a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha,</span> a householder, is permitted to indulge in sex at any time. This is a wrong conception of <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> life. In spiritual life, whether one is a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha, v&#257;naprastha, sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> or <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;,</span> everyone is under the control of the spiritual master. For <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s</span> there are strong restrictions on sexual indulgence. Similarly, there are strong restrictions for <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hasthas.</span> <span class="Italic">G&#7771;hasthas</span> should indulge in sex life only in accordance with the order of the <span class="Italic">guru.</span> Therefore it is mentioned here that one must follow the orders of the spiritual master (<span class="Italic">guru-v&#7771;ttir vikalpena</span>). When the spiritual master orders, the <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> may accept sex life. This is confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexbe66.html?g=2559">7.11</a>). <span class="Italic">Dharm&#257;viruddho bh&#363;te&#7779;u k&#257;mo &rsquo;smi:</span> indulgence in sex life without disobedience to the religious rules and regulations constitutes a religious principle. The <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> is allowed to indulge in sex life during the period favorable for procreation and in accordance with the spiritual master&rsquo;s order. If the spiritual master&rsquo;s orders allow a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> to engage in sex life at a particular time, then the <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> may do so; otherwise, if the spiritual master orders against it, the <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> should abstain. The <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> must obtain permission from the spiritual master to observe the ritualistic ceremony of <span class="Italic">garbh&#257;dh&#257;na-sa&#7745;sk&#257;ra.</span> Then he may approach his wife to beget children, otherwise not. A <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> generally remains a <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> throughout his entire life, but although some <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> become <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hasthas</span> and indulge in sex life, they do so under the complete control of the spiritual master. The <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> is allowed to marry more than one wife, but this also must be in accordance with the instructions of the spiritual master. It is not that because one is a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> he may marry as many times as he likes and indulge in sex life as he likes. This is not spiritual life. In spiritual life, one must conduct one&rsquo;s whole life under the guidance of the <span class="Italic">guru.</span> Only one who executes his spiritual life under the direction of the spiritual master can achieve the mercy of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. <span class="Italic">Yasya pras&#257;d&#257;d bhagavat-pras&#257;da&#7717; .</span> If one desires to advance in spiritual life but he acts whimsically, not following the orders of the spiritual master, he has no shelter. <span class="Italic">Yasy&#257;pras&#257;d&#257;n na gati&#7717; kuto &rsquo;pi.</span> Without the spiritual master&rsquo;s order, even the <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> should not indulge in sex life.</div>

<div class="Translation">According to the rules and regulations mentioned above, one who is twice-born, namely a br&#257;hma&#7751;a, k&#7779;atriya or vai&#347;ya, should reside in the guru-kula under the care of the spiritual master. There he should study and learn all the Vedic literatures along with their supplements and the Upani&#7779;ads, according to his ability and power to study. If possible, the student or disciple should reward the spiritual master with the remuneration the spiritual master requests, and then, following the master&rsquo;s order, the disciple should leave and accept one of the other &#257;&#347;ramas, namely the g&#7771;hastha-&#257;&#347;rama, v&#257;naprastha-&#257;&#347;rama or sanny&#257;sa-&#257;&#347;rama, as he desires.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">To study the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and understand them, of course, requires some special intelligence, but the members of the three higher sections of society&mdash;namely the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as, k&#7779;atriyas</span> and <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas</span>&mdash;must learn the Vedic literatures according to their capability and power to understand. In other words, studying the Vedic literatures is compulsory for everyone but the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> and <span class="Italic">antyajas.</span> The Vedic literature gives the knowledge that can lead one to understand the Absolute Truth&mdash;Brahman, Param&#257;tm&#257; or Bhagav&#257;n. <span class="Italic">Guru-kula,</span> or the reformatory educational institution, should be used only to understand Vedic knowledge. At the present time there are many educational institutions for training and technology, but such knowledge has nothing to do with understanding of the Absolute Truth. Technology, therefore, is meant for the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras,</span> whereas the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are meant for the <span class="Italic">dvijas.</span> Consequently this verse states, <span class="Italic">dvijo &rsquo;dh&#299;ty&#257;vabudhya ca tray&#299;&#7745; s&#257;&#7749;gopani&#7779;adam.</span> At the present time, in the age of Kali, practically everyone is a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra,</span> and no one is a <span class="Italic">dvija.</span> Therefore the condition of society has very much deteriorated.</div>
<div class="Purport">Another point to be observed from this verse is that from the <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;-&#257;&#347;rama</span> one may accept the <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa-&#257;&#347;rama, v&#257;naprastha-&#257;&#347;rama</span> or <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha-&#257;&#347;rama.</span> It is not compulsory for a <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> to become a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha.</span> Because the ultimate aim is to understand the Absolute Truth, there is no necessity of going through all the different <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;ramas.</span> Thus one may proceed to the <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa-&#257;&#347;rama</span> directly from the <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;-&#257;&#347;rama.</span> &#346;r&#299;la Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura accepted the <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa-&#257;&#347;rama</span> directly from the <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;-&#257;&#347;rama.</span> In other words, His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura did not think it compulsory to accept the <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha-&#257;&#347;rama</span> or <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha-&#257;&#347;rama.</span></div>

<div class="First">Realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead&rsquo;s omnipresence is the perfect realization of the Absolute Truth to be attained through the study of the Vedic literatures.

We should understand that whenever the Supreme Personality of Godhead is present, He is present with all His paraphernalia, including His name, form, associates and servants. The living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus one should understand that since the Supreme Lord has entered the atom, the living entities are also there. One must accept the inconceivable quality of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for no one can understand from the material point of view how the Lord is all-pervasive and yet is situated in His own abode, Goloka V&#7771;nd&#257;vana.

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This Thirteenth Chapter describes the regulative principles for <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s</span> and also describes the history of an <span class="Italic">avadh&#363;ta.</span> It concludes with a description of perfection for the student in spiritual advancement.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">&#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada Muni has been describing the symptoms of various <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;ramas</span> and <span class="Italic">var&#7751;as.</span> Now, in this chapter, he specifically describes the regulative principles to be followed by <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s.</span> After retiring from family life, one should accept the status of <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha,</span> in which he must formally accept the body as his means of existence but gradually forget the bodily necessities of life. After <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha</span> life, having left home, one should travel to different places as a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;.</span> Without bodily comforts and free from dependence on anyone with respect to bodily necessities, one should travel everywhere, wearing almost nothing or actually walking naked. Without association with ordinary human society, one should beg alms and always be satisfied in himself. One should be a friend to every living entity and be very peaceful in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. A <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> should travel alone in this way, not caring for life or death, waiting for the time when he will leave his material body. He should not indulge in unnecessary books or adopt professions like astrology, nor should he try to become a great orator. He should also give up the path of unnecessary argument and should not depend on anyone under any circumstances. He should not try to allure people into becoming his disciples just so that the number of his disciples may increase. He should give up the habit of reading many books as a means of livelihood, and he should not attempt to increase the number of temples and <span class="Italic">ma&#7789;has,</span> or monasteries. When a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> thus becomes completely independent, peaceful and equipoised, he can select the destination he desires after death and follow the principles by which to reach that destination. Although fully learned, he should always remain silent, like a dumb person, and travel like a restless child.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">In this regard, N&#257;rada Muni described a meeting between Prahl&#257;da and a saintly person who had adopted the mode of life of a python. In this way he described the symptoms of a <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa.</span> A person who has attained the <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa</span> stage knows very well the distinction between matter and spirit. He is not at all interested in gratifying the material senses, for he is always deriving pleasure from devotional service to the Lord. He is not very anxious to protect his material body. Being satisfied with whatever he attains by the grace of the Lord, he is completely independent of material happiness and distress, and thus he is transcendental to all regulative principles. Sometimes he accepts severe austerities, and sometimes he accepts material opulence. His only concern is to satisfy K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and for that purpose he can do anything and everything, without reference to the regulative principles. He is never to be equated with materialistic men, nor is he subject to the judgments of such men.</div>

<div class="Translation">Since the material body is sure to be vanquished and the duration of one&rsquo;s life is not fixed, neither death nor life is to be praised. Rather, one should observe the eternal time factor, in which the living entity manifests himself and disappears.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The living entities in the material world, not only at the present but also in the past, have been involved in trying to solve the problem of birth and death. Some stress death and point to the illusory existence of everything material, whereas others stress life, trying to preserve it perpetually and enjoy it to the best of their ability. Both of them are fools and rascals. It is advised that one observe the eternal time factor, which is the cause of the material body&rsquo;s appearance and disappearance, and that one observe the living entity&rsquo;s entanglement in this time factor. &#346;r&#299;la Bhaktivinoda &#7788;h&#257;kura therefore sings in his <span class="Italic">G&#299;t&#257;val&#299;:</span></div>
<div class="Centered-Verse-in-purp">an&#257;di karama-phale,     pa&#7693;i&rsquo; bhav&#257;r&#7751;ava-jale,<br>tarib&#257;re n&#257; dekhi up&#257;ya</div>
<div class="After-Verse">One should observe the activities of eternal time, which is the cause of birth and death. Before the creation of the present millennium, the living entities were under the influence of the time factor, and within the time factor the material world comes into existence and is again annihilated. <span class="Italic">Bh&#363;tv&#257; bh&#363;tv&#257; pral&#299;yate.</span> Being under the control of the time factor, the living entities appear and die, life after life. This time factor is the impersonal representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who gives the living entities conditioned by material nature a chance to emerge from this nature by surrendering to Him.</div>

<div class="Translation">Literature that is a useless waste of time&mdash;in other words, literature without spiritual benefit&mdash;should be rejected. One should not become a professional teacher as a means of earning one&rsquo;s livelihood, nor should one indulge in arguments and counter-arguments.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">A person desiring to advance in spiritual understanding should be extremely careful to avoid reading ordinary literature. The world is full of ordinary literature that creates unnecessary agitation in the mind. Such literature, including newspapers, dramas, novels and magazines, is factually not meant for advancement in spiritual knowledge. Indeed, it has been described as a place of enjoyment for crows (<span class="Italic">tad v&#257;yasa&#7745; t&#299;rtham</span>). Anyone advancing in spiritual knowledge must reject such literature. Furthermore, one should not concern oneself with the conclusions of various logicians or philosophers. Of course, those who preach sometimes need to argue with the contentions of opponents, but as much as possible one should avoid an argumentative attitude. In this connection, &#346;r&#299;la Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya says:</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;There is no need to take shelter of unnecessary literature or concern oneself with many so-called philosophers and thinkers who are useless for spiritual advancement.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">So-called <span class="Italic">sv&#257;m&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> generally make disciples by alluring them with material benefits. There are many so-called <span class="Italic">gurus</span> who attract disciples by promising to cure their diseases or increase their material opulence by manufacturing gold. These are lucrative allurements for unintelligent men. A <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> is prohibited from making disciples through such material allurements. <span class="Italic">Sanny&#257;s&#299;s</span> sometimes indulge in material opulence by unnecessarily constructing many temples and monasteries, but actually such endeavors should be avoided. Temples and monasteries should be constructed for the preaching of spiritual consciousness or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, not to provide free hotels for persons who are useful for neither material nor spiritual purposes. Temples and monasteries should be strictly off limits to worthless clubs of crazy men. In the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement we welcome everyone who agrees at least to follow the movement&rsquo;s regulative principles&mdash;no illicit sex, no intoxication, no meat-eating and no gambling. In the temples and monasteries, gatherings of unnecessary, rejected, lazy fellows should be strictly disallowed. The temples and monasteries should be used exclusively by devotees who are serious about spiritual advancement in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura explains the word <span class="Italic">&#257;rambh&#257;n</span> as meaning <span class="Italic">ma&#7789;h&#257;di-vy&#257;p&#257;r&#257;n,</span> which means &ldquo;attempts to construct temples and monasteries.&rdquo; The first business of the <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> is to preach K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, but if, by the grace of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, facilities are available, then he may construct temples and monasteries to give shelter to the serious students of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. Otherwise such temples and monasteries are not needed.</div>

In the material world also, we generally see that when a man who is poor and skinny gradually endeavors to earn money through business or some other means and he then gets the money, he enjoys the senses to his satisfaction. By enjoying the senses one becomes fat. Therefore in spiritual advancement becoming fat is not at all satisfactory.</div>

This is called the struggle for existence. One kind of fruitive activity causes the living being to take one form of body, and because of actions performed in that body, another body is created. One must therefore stop these material activities, and the chance to do so is given in the human form of life. Specifically, our energy to act should be engaged in the service of the Lord, for then materialistic activities will automatically stop. One must fulfill one&rsquo;s desires by surrendering unto the Supreme Lord, for He knows how to fulfill them. Even though one may have material desires, one should therefore engage in the devotional service of the Lord. That will purify one&rsquo;s struggle for existence.</div>

<div class="Translation">In the course of the evolutionary process, which is caused by fruitive activities due to undesirable material sense gratification, I have received this human form of life, which can lead to the heavenly planets, to liberation, to the lower species, or to rebirth among human beings.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">All living entities within this material world are undergoing the cycle of birth and death according to the laws of nature. This struggle of birth and death in different species may be called the evolutionary process, but in the Western world it has been wrongly explained. Darwin&rsquo;s theory of evolution from animal to man is incomplete because the theory does not present the reverse condition, namely evolution from man to animal. In this verse, however, evolution has been very well explained on the strength of Vedic authority. Human life, which is obtained in the course of the evolutionary process, is a chance for elevation (<span class="Italic">svarg&#257;pavarga</span>) or for degradation (<span class="Italic">tira&#347;c&#257;m punar asya ca</span>). If one uses this human form of life properly, he can elevate himself to the higher planetary systems, where material happiness is many thousands of times better than on this planet, or one may cultivate knowledge by which to become free from the evolutionary process and be reinstated in one&rsquo;s original spiritual life. This is called <span class="Italic">apavarga,</span> or liberation.</div>
<div class="Purport">Material life is called <span class="Italic">pavarga</span> because here we are subject to five different states of suffering, represented by the letters <span class="Italic">pa, pha, ba, bha</span> and <span class="Italic">ma.</span> <span class="Italic">Pa</span> means <span class="Italic">pari&#347;rama,</span> very hard labor. <span class="Italic">Pha</span> means <span class="Italic">phena,</span> or foam from the mouth. For example, sometimes we see a horse foaming at the mouth with heavy labor. <span class="Italic">Ba</span> means <span class="Italic">byarthat&#257;,</span> disappointment. In spite of so much hard labor, at the end we find disappointment. <span class="Italic">Bha</span> means <span class="Italic">bhaya,</span> or fear. In material life, one is always in the blazing fire of fear, since no one knows what will happen next. Finally, <span class="Italic">ma</span> means <span class="Italic">m&#7771;tyu,</span> or death. When one attempts to nullify these five different statuses of life&mdash;<span class="Italic">pa, pha, ba, bha</span> and <span class="Italic">ma</span>&mdash;one achieves <span class="Italic">apavarga,</span> or liberation from the punishment of material existence.</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">tira&#347;c&#257;m</span> refers to degraded life. Human life, of course, provides an opportunity for the best living conditions. As Western people think, from the monkeys come the human beings, who are more comfortably situated. However, if one does not utilize his human life for <span class="Italic">svarga</span> or <span class="Italic">apavarga,</span> he falls again to the degraded life of animals like dogs and hogs. Therefore a sane human being must consider whether he will elevate himself to the higher planets, prepare to free himself from the evolutionary process, or travel again through the evolutionary process in higher and lower grades of life. If one works piously one may be elevated to the higher planetary systems or achieve liberation and return home, back to Godhead, but otherwise one may be degraded to a life as a dog, a hog and so on. As explained in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index0567.html?g=3210">9.25</a>), <span class="Italic">y&#257;nti deva-vrat&#257; dev&#257;n.</span> Those interested in being elevated to the higher planetary systems (Devaloka or Svargaloka) must prepare to do so. Similarly, if one wants liberation and wants to return home, back to Godhead, he should prepare himself for that purpose.</div>
<div class="Purport">Our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is therefore the highest movement for the benediction of human society because this movement is teaching people how to go back home, back to Godhead. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index4913.html?g=4477">13.22</a>) it is clearly stated that different forms of life are obtained by association with the three modes of material nature (<span class="Italic">k&#257;ra&#7751;a&#7745; gu&#7751;a-sa&#7749;go &rsquo;sya sad-asad-yoni janmasu</span>). According to one&rsquo;s association with the material qualities of goodness, passion and ignorance in this life, in one&rsquo;s next life one receives an appropriate body. Modern civilization does not know that because of varied association in material nature, the living entity, although eternal, is placed in different diseased conditions known as the many species of life. Modern civilization is unaware of the laws of nature.</div>

Actually, however, they cannot be independent. This is foolishness. A foolish civilization is extremely risky, and therefore the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is trying to make people aware of their fully dependent condition under the stringent laws of nature and is trying to save them from being victimized by strong <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> which is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s external energy.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">As stated by Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, <span class="Italic">yan maithun&#257;di-g&#7771;hamedhi-sukha&#7745; hi tuccham</I> [SB </I></span><a href="indexaa4a.html?g=57238">7.9.45</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> Man and woman both seek sexual enjoyment, and when they are united by the ritualistic ceremony of marriage, they are happy for some time, but finally there is dissension, and thus there are so many cases of separation and divorce. Although every man and woman is actually eager to enjoy life through sexual unity, the result is disunity and distress. Marriage is recommended to give men and women a concession for restricted sex life, which is also recommended in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">Dharm&#257;viruddho bh&#363;te&#7779;u k&#257;mo &rsquo;smi:</span> sex life not against the principles of religion is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Every living entity is always eager to enjoy sex life because materialistic life consists of eating, sleeping, sex and fear. In animal life, eating, sleeping, sexual enjoyment and fear cannot be regulated, but for human society the plan is that although men, like animals, must be allowed to eat, sleep, enjoy sex and take protection from fear, they must be regulated. The Vedic plan for eating recommends that one take <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a-&#347;i&#7779;&#7789;a,</span> or <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da,</span> food offered to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. <span class="Italic">Yaj&ntilde;a-&#347;i&#7779;&#7789;&#257;&#347;ina&#7717; santo mucyante sama-kilbi&#7779;ai&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat food that is offered first for sacrifice.&rdquo; (Bg. <a href="index40ff.html?g=1149">3.13</a>) In material life, one commits sinful activities, especially in eating, and because of sinful activities one is condemned by nature&rsquo;s laws to accept another body, which is imposed as punishment. Sex and eating are essential, and therefore they are offered to human society under Vedic restrictions so that according to the Vedic injunctions people may eat, sleep, enjoy sex, be protected from fearful life and gradually be elevated and liberated from the punishment of material existence. Thus the Vedic injunctions for marriage offer a concession to human society, the idea being that a man and woman united in a ritualistic marriage ceremony should help one another advance in spiritual life. Unfortunately, especially in this age, men and women unite for unrestricted sexual enjoyment. Thus they are victimized, being obliged to take rebirth in the forms of animals to fulfill their animalistic propensities. The Vedic injunctions therefore warn, <span class="Italic">n&#257;ya&#7745; deho deha-bh&#257;j&#257;&#7745; n&#7771;loke ka&#7779;&#7789;&#257;n k&#257;m&#257;n arhate vid-bhuj&#257;&#7745; ye</I> [SB </I></span><a href="index42d9.html?g=42737">5.5.1</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> One should not enjoy sex life like hogs, and eat everything, even to the limit of stool. A human being should eat <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da</span> offered to the Deity and should enjoy sex life according to the Vedic injunctions. He should engage himself in the business of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, he should save himself from the fearful condition of material existence, and he should sleep only to recover from fatigue due to working hard.</div>

<div class="Translation">The actual form of life for the living entities is one of spiritual happiness, which is real happiness. This happiness can be achieved only when one stops all materialistic activities. Material sense enjoyment is simply imagination. Therefore, considering this subject matter, I have ceased from all material activities and am lying down here.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The difference between the philosophy of the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s and that of the Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas is explained herein. Both the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s and Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas know that in materialistic activities there is no happiness. The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers, therefore, adhering to the slogan <span class="Italic">brahma satya&#7745; jagan mithy&#257;,</span> want to refrain from false, materialistic activities. They want to stop all activities and merge in the Supreme Brahman. According to the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava philosophy, however, if one simply ceases from materialistic activity one cannot remain inactive for very long, and therefore everyone should engage himself in spiritual activities, which will solve the problem of suffering in this material world. It is said, therefore, that although the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers strive to refrain from materialistic activities and merge in Brahman, and although they may actually merge in the Brahman existence, for want of activity they fall down again into materialistic activity (<span class="Italic">&#257;ruhya k&#7771;cchre&#7751;a para&#7745; pada&#7745; tata&#7717; patanty adha&#7717;</I> [SB </I></span><a href="indexb411.html?g=76083">10.2.32</a>]). Thus the so-called renouncer, unable to remain in meditation upon Brahman, returns to materialistic activities by opening hospitals and schools and so on. Therefore, simply cultivating knowledge that materialistic activities cannot give one happiness, and that one should consequently cease from such activities, is insufficient. One should cease from materialistic activities and take up spiritual activities. Then the solution to the problem will be achieved. Spiritual activities are activities performed according to the order of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (<span class="Italic">&#257;nuk&#363;lyena k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;&#257;nu&#347;&#299;lanam</span>). If one does whatever K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says, his activities are not material. For example, when Arjuna fought in response to the order of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, his activities were not material. Fighting for sense gratification is a materialistic activity, but fighting by the order of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is spiritual. By spiritual activities one becomes eligible to go back home, back to Godhead, and then enjoy blissful life eternally. Here, in the material world, everything is but a mental concoction that will never give us real happiness. The practical solution, therefore, is to cease from materialistic activities and engage in spiritual activities. <span class="Italic">Yaj&ntilde;&#257;rth&#257;t karma&#7751;o &rsquo;nyatra loko &rsquo;ya&#7745; karma-bandhana&#7717;</I> [Bg. </I><a href="indexde01.html?g=1113">3.9</a></I>]</I></span>)<span class="Italic">.</span> If one works for the sake of pleasing the Supreme Lord&mdash;Yaj&ntilde;a, or Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&mdash;one is in liberated life.

There is no question of miseries for the spiritual being. As K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is always happy, the living entities, who are His parts and parcels, are also happy by nature, but because of being put within this material world and forgetting their eternal relationship with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, they have forgotten their real nature. Because every one of us is a part of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, we have a very affectionate relationship with Him, but because we have forgotten our identities and are considering the body to be the self, we are afflicted by all the troubles of birth, death, old age and disease. This misconception in materialistic life continues unless and until one comes to understand his relationship with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The happiness sought by the conditioned soul is certainly only illusion, as explained in the next verse.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This is an accurate example depicting how the living entity, because of lack of knowledge, runs after happiness outside his own self. When one understands his real identity as a spiritual being, he can understand the supreme spiritual being, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and the real happiness exchanged between K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and one&rsquo;s self. It is very interesting to note how this verse points to the body&rsquo;s growth from the spirit soul. The modern materialistic scientist thinks that life grows from matter, but actually the fact is that matter grows from life. The life, or the spiritual soul, is compared herein to water, from which clumps of matter grow in the form of grass. One who is ignorant of scientific knowledge of the spirit soul does not look inside the body to find happiness in the soul; instead, he goes outside to search for happiness, just as a deer without knowledge of the water beneath the grass goes out to the desert to find water. The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is trying to remove the ignorance of misled human beings who are trying to find water outside the jurisdiction of life. <span class="Italic">Raso vai sa&#7717;.</span> <span class="Italic">Raso &rsquo;ham apsu kaunteya.</span> The taste of water is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.

<div class="First">Because the materialist is in gross ignorance of how the laws of material nature act upon him as a result of his fruitive activity, he mistakenly plans to enjoy bodily comfort in the human form of life through so-called economic development, through pious activities for elevation to the higher planetary systems, and in many other ways, but factually he becomes a victim of the reactions of his fruitive activities. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated as the Supersoul within the cores of the hearts of all living entities. As the Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a>):</div>

As clearly stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index0d72.html?g=5952">18.61</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">&#299;&#347;vara&#7717; sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;n&#257;&#7745;<br>h&#7771;d-de&#347;e &rsquo;rjuna ti&#7779;&#7789;hati<br>bhr&#257;mayan sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;ni<br>yantr&#257;r&#363;&#7693;h&#257;ni m&#257;yay&#257;</div>
<div class="After-Verse">The Lord is situated in everyone&rsquo;s heart, and as one desires, the Lord gives one various types of bodies, which are like machines. Riding on such a machine, the living entity wanders throughout the universe, under the control of material nature and its modes. Thus the living being is not at all free to act, but is fully under the control of material nature, which is fully under the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purport">As soon as a living entity is victimized by material desires to lord it over material nature, he is subjected to the control of material nature, which is supervised by the Supreme Soul. The result is that one again and again makes plans and is baffled, but as foolish as he is he cannot see the cause of his bafflement. This cause is distinctly stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;:</span> because one has not surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he must work under the control of material nature and its stringent laws (<span class="Italic">daiv&#299; hy e&#7779;&#257; gu&#7751;a-may&#299; mama m&#257;y&#257; duratyay&#257;</span>). The only means of becoming free from this entanglement is to surrender to the Supreme Lord. In the human form of life, the living entity must accept this instruction from the Supreme Person, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a: <span class="Italic">sarva-dharm&#257;n parityajya m&#257;m eka&#7745; &#347;ara&#7751;a&#7745; vraja</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="index3a32.html?g=5997">18.66</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> &ldquo;Do not plan to achieve happiness and drive away distress. You will never be successful. Simply surrender unto Me.&rdquo; Unfortunately, however, the living entity does not accept the Supreme Lord&rsquo;s clearly stated instructions from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> and thus he becomes a perpetual captive of the laws of material nature.</div>

These reactions are called <span class="Italic">p&#257;pa</span> and <span class="Italic">pu&#7751;ya</span>&mdash;sinful and pious. By pious activities one is elevated to the higher planetary systems, and by impious activities one is degraded to lower species of life, in which he is punished by the laws of nature. In the lower species of life there is an evolutionary process, and when the term of the living entity&rsquo;s imprisonment or punishment in the lower species is finished, he is again offered a human form and given a chance to decide for himself which way he should plan. If he again misses the opportunity, he is again put into the cycle of birth and death, going sometimes higher and sometimes lower, turning on the <span class="Italic">sa&#7745;s&#257;ra-cakra,</span> the wheel of material existence. As a wheel sometimes goes up and sometimes comes down, the stringent laws of material nature make the living entity in material existence sometimes happy and sometimes distressed. How he suffers in the cycle of happiness and distress is described in the next verse.</div>

If one works very hard, suffering the threefold miseries, and then is successful in getting some small benefit, what is the value of this benefit? Besides that, even if a <span class="Italic">karm&#299;</span> is successful in accumulating some material wealth, he still cannot enjoy it, for he must die in bereavement. I have even seen a dying man begging a medical attendant to increase his life by four years so that he could complete his material plans. Of course, the medical man was unsuccessful in expanding the life of the man, who therefore died in great bereavement. Everyone must die in this way, and after one&rsquo;s mental condition is taken into account by the laws of material nature, he is given another chance to fulfill his desires in a different body. Material plans for material happiness have no value, but under the spell of the illusory energy we consider them extremely valuable. There were many politicians, social reformers and philosophers who died very miserably, without deriving any practical value from their material plans. Therefore, a sane and sensible man never desires to work hard under the conditions of threefold miseries, only to die in disappointment.</div>

<div class="First">Greedy capitalists accumulate wealth under so many miserable conditions, the result being that because they collect money by questionable means, their minds are always agitated. Thus they are unable to sleep at night, and they have to take pills for mental tranquillity to invite sleep. And sometimes even the pills are a failure. Consequently the result of having accumulated money by so much labor is certainly not happiness, but only distress. What is the value of acquiring a comfortable position if one&rsquo;s mind is always disturbed? Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura has therefore sung:</div>

<div class="Purport">As far as our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is concerned, we are getting money naturally, by the grace of God, by selling our literature. This literature is not sold for our sense gratification; to spread the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement we need so many things, and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is therefore supplying us the requisite money to advance this mission. The mission of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is to spread K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness all over the world, and for this purpose we naturally must have sufficient money. Therefore, according to the advice of &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; Prabhup&#257;da, we should not give up attachment to money that can spread the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement. &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; says in his <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhakti-ras&#257;m&#7771;ta-sindhu</span> (1.2.256):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">pr&#257;pa&ntilde;cikatay&#257; buddhy&#257;<br>hari-sambandhi-vastuna&#7717;<br>mumuk&#7779;ubhi&#7717; parity&#257;go<br>vairagya&#7745; phalgu kathyate</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;When persons eager to achieve liberation renounce things which are related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, though they are material, this is called incomplete renunciation.&rdquo; Money that can help in spreading the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is not a part of the material world, and we should not give it up, thinking that it is material. &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; advises:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">an&#257;saktasya vi&#7779;ay&#257;n<br>yath&#257;rham upayu&ntilde;jata&#7717;<br>nirbandha&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-sambandhe<br>yukta&#7745; vair&#257;gyam ucyate</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;When one is not attached to anything, but at the same time accepts everything in relation to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, one is rightly situated above possessiveness.&rdquo; (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bhakti-ras&#257;m&#7771;ta-sindhu</span> 1.2.255) Money is undoubtedly coming in great quantities, but we should not be attached to this money for sense gratification; every cent should be spent for spreading the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, not for sense gratification. There is danger for a preacher when he receives great quantities of money, for as soon as he spends even a single cent of the collection for his personal sense gratification, he becomes a fallen victim. The preachers of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement should be extremely careful not to misuse the immense quantities of money needed to spread this movement. Let us not make this money the cause of our distress; it should be used for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and that will cause our eternal happiness. Money is Lak&#7779;m&#299;, or the goddess of fortune, the companion of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. Lak&#7779;m&#299;j&#299; must always remain with N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, and then there need be no fear of degradation.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Here is the difference between Vedic civilization and the modern demoniac civilization. Vedic civilization concerned itself with how to achieve self-realization, and for this purpose one was recommended to have a small income to maintain body and soul together. The society was divided into <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as, k&#7779;atriyas, vai&#347;yas</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras,</span> and the members of this society would limit their endeavors to meeting their minimum demands. The <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> in particular, would have no material desires. Because the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> had to rule the people, it was necessary for them to have money and prestige. But the <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas</span> were satisfied with agricultural produce and milk from the cow, and if by chance there were excess, trade was allowed. The <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> were also happy, for they would get food and shelter from the three higher classes. In the demoniac civilization of the present day, however, there is no question of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> or <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas;</span> there are only so-called workers and a flourishing mercantile class who have no goal in life.</div>
<div class="Purport">According to Vedic civilization, the ultimate perfection of life is to take <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa,</span> but at the present moment people do not know why <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> is accepted. Because of misunderstanding, they think that one accepts <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> to escape social responsibilities. But one does not accept <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> to escape from responsibility to society. Generally one accepts <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> at the fourth stage of spiritual life. One begins as a <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> then becomes a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha,</span> a <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha</span> and finally a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> to take advantage of the duration of one&rsquo;s life by engaging oneself fully in self-realization. <span class="Italic">Sanny&#257;sa</span> does not mean begging from door to door to accumulate money for sense gratification. However, because in Kali-yuga people are more or less prone to sense gratification, immature <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> is not recommended. &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; writes in his <span class="Ref_Italic">Nectar of Instruction</span> (2):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">aty&#257;h&#257;ra&#7717; pray&#257;sa&#347; ca<br>prajalpo niyam&#257;graha&#7717;<br>jana-sa&#7749;ga&#347; ca laulya&#7745; ca<br>&#7779;a&#7693;bhir bhaktir vina&#347;yati</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;One&rsquo;s devotional service is spoiled when he becomes too entangled in the following six activities: (1) eating more than necessary or collecting more funds than required; (2) overendeavoring for mundane things that are very difficult to obtain; (3) talking unnecessarily about mundane subject matters; (4) practicing the scriptural rules and regulations only for the sake of following them and not for the sake of spiritual advancement, or rejecting the rules and regulations of the scriptures and working independently or whimsically; (5) associating with worldly-minded persons who are not interested in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness; and (6) being greedy for mundane achievements.&rdquo; A <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> should have an institution meant to preach K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness; he need not accumulate money for himself. We recommend that as soon as money accumulates in our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, fifty per cent of it should be invested in printing books, and fifty per cent for expenditures, especially in establishing centers all over the world. The managers of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement should be extremely cautious in regard to this point. Otherwise money will be the cause of lamentation, illusion, fear, anger, material attachment, material poverty, and unnecessary hard work. When I was alone in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, I never attempted to construct <span class="Italic">ma&#7789;h&#257;s</span> or temples; rather, I was fully satisfied with the small amount of money I could gather by selling <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead,</span> and thus I would provide for myself and also print the literature. When I went to foreign countries, I lived according to the same principle, but when Europeans and Americans began to give money profusely, I started temples and Deity worship. The same principle should still be followed. Whatever money is collected should be spent for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and not a farthing for sense gratification. This is the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata</span> principle.</div>

There is no use in praising someone for material qualifications or blaspheming him for material disqualifications. In the material world, good and bad have no meaning because if one is good he may be elevated to a higher planetary system and if one is bad he may be degraded to the lower planetary systems. People of different mentalities are sometimes elevated and sometimes degraded, but this is not the goal of life. Rather, the goal of life is to become free from elevation and degradation and take to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. Therefore a saintly person does not discriminate between that which is supposedly good and supposedly bad; rather, he desires for everyone to be happy in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, which is the ultimate goal of life.</div>

<div class="First">By an analytical study of the entire constitution of the body, one can surely come to the conclusion that the soul is different from all the body&rsquo;s material constituents, such as earth, water, fire and air. Thus the difference between the body and soul can be realized by a person who is thoughtful (<span class="Italic">man&#299;&#7779;&#299;</span> or <span class="Italic">muni</span>), and after this realization of the individual spirit soul one can very easily understand the supreme spirit soul. If one thus realizes that the individual soul is subordinate to the supreme spirit soul, he achieves self-realization. As explained in the Thirteenth Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> there are two souls within the body. The body is called <span class="Italic">k&#7779;etra,</span> and there are two <span class="Italic">k&#7779;etra j&ntilde;as,</span> or occupants of the body, namely the Supersoul (Param&#257;tm&#257;) and the individual soul. The Supersoul and the individual soul are like two birds sitting on the same tree (the material body). One bird, the individual, forgetful bird, is eating the fruit of the tree, not caring for the instructions of the other bird, which is only a witness to the activities of the first bird, who is his friend. When the forgetful bird comes to understand the supreme friend who is always with him and trying to give him guidance in different bodies, he takes shelter at the lotus feet of that supreme bird. As explained in the <span class="Italic">yoga</span> process, <span class="Italic">dhy&#257;n&#257;vasthita-tad-gatena manas&#257; pa&#347;yanti ya&#7745; yogina&#7717;</I> [SB </span></I>12.13.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> When one actually becomes a perfect <span class="Italic">yog&#299;,</span> by meditation he can see the supreme friend and surrender unto Him.

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This chapter describes the occupational duties of the householder according to the time, the country and the performer. When Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira Mah&#257;r&#257;ja became very much inquisitive about the occupational duties for the householder, N&#257;rada Muni advised him that a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha&rsquo;s</span> first duty is to be fully dependent on V&#257;sudeva, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and to try to satisfy Him in all respects by executing one&rsquo;s prescribed devotional service. This devotional service will depend on the instructions of authorities and the association of devotees who are actually engaged in devotional service. The beginning of devotional service is <span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;am,</span> or hearing. One must hear from the mouths of realized souls. In this way the <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha&rsquo;s</span> attraction to his wife and children will gradually be reduced.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">As for the maintenance of his family, a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha,</span> while earning what he requires for his living, must be very conscientious and must not undergo extraordinary endeavor simply to accumulate money and unnecessarily increase in material comforts. Although a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> should externally be very active in earning his livelihood, he should internally be situated as a fully self-realized person, without attachment for material gains. His dealings with family members or friends should be performed simply to fulfill their purpose; one should not be extravagantly engaged in this way. Instructions from family members and society should be accepted superficially, but in essence the <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> should be engaged in occupational duties advised by the spiritual master and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra.</span> Specifically a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> should engage in agricultural activities to earn money. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; </span>(<a href="index8e55.html?g=5811">18.44</a>), <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;i-go-rak&#7779;ya-v&#257;&#7751;ijyam</span>&mdash;agriculture, cow protection and trade&mdash;are special duties of <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hasthas.</span> If by chance or by the grace of the Lord more money comes, it should be properly engaged for the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement. One should not be eager to earn more money simply for sensual pleasure. A <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> should always remember that one who is endeavoring to accumulate more money than necessary is to be considered a thief and is punishable by the laws of nature.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">A <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> should be very much affectionate toward lower animals, birds and bees, treating them exactly like his own children. A <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> should not indulge in killing animals or birds for sense gratification. He should provide the necessities of life even to the dogs and the lowest creatures and should not exploit others for sense gratification. Factually, according to the instructions of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> every <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> is a great communist who provides the means of living for everyone. Whatever a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> may possess he should equally distribute to all living entities, without discrimination. The best process is to distribute <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da.</span></div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">A <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> should not be very much attached to his wife; he should engage even his own wife in serving a guest with all attention. Whatever money a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> accumulates by the grace of God he should spend in five activities, namely worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, receiving Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas and saintly persons, distributing <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da</span> to the general public and to all living entities, offering <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da</span> to his forefathers, and also offering <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da</span> to his own self. <span class="Italic">G&#7771;hasthas</span> should always be ready to worship everyone as mentioned above. The <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> should not eat anything not offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As it is said in the <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index40ff.html?g=1149">3.13</a>), <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a-&#347;i&#7779;&#7789;&#257;&#347;ina&#7717; santo mucyante sarva-kilbi&#7779;ai&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat food that is offered first for sacrifice.&rdquo; The <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> should also visit the holy places of pilgrimage mentioned in the <span class="Italic">pur&#257;&#7751;as.</span> In this way he should fully engage in worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead for the benefit of his family, his society, his country, and humanity at large.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira inquired from N&#257;rada Muni: O my lord, O great sage, kindly explain how we who are staying at home without knowledge of the goal of life may also easily attain liberation, according to the instructions of the Vedas.<span class="Italic"></span></div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the previous chapters the great sage N&#257;rada has explained how a <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;,</span> a <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha</span> and a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> should act. He first explained the dealings of a <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;, v&#257;naprastha</span> and <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> because these three <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;ramas,</span> or statuses of life, are extremely important for fulfillment of the goal of life. One should note that in the <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;-&#257;&#347;rama, v&#257;naprastha-&#257;&#347;rama</span> and <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa-&#257;&#347;rama</span> there is no scope for sex life, whereas sex is allowed in <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> life under regulations. N&#257;rada Muni, therefore, first described <span class="Italic">brahmacarya, v&#257;naprastha</span> and <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> because he wanted to stress that sex is not at all necessary, although one who absolutely requires it is allowed to enter <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> life, or household life, which is also regulated by the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> and <span class="Italic">guru.</span> Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira Mah&#257;r&#257;ja could understand all this. Therefore, as a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha,</span> he presented himself as <span class="Italic">g&#7771;ha-m&#363;&#7693;ha-dh&#299;&#7717;,</span> one who is completely ignorant of the goal of life. A person who remains a householder in family life is certainly ignorant of life&rsquo;s goal; he is not very much advanced in intelligence. As soon as possible, one should give up his so-called comfortable life at home and prepare to undergo austerity, or <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> <span class="Italic">Tapo divya&#7745; putrak&#257;.</span> According to the instructions given by &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva to His sons, we should not create a so-called comfortable situation, but must prepare to undergo austerity. This is how a human being should actually live to fulfill life&rsquo;s ultimate goal.</div>

How to satisfy V&#257;sudeva in this life can be perfectly understood through the association of great devotees of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The format for <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> life should be dedication to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexaee8.html?g=2065">6.1</a>) it is said:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">an&#257;&#347;rita&#7717; karma-phala&#7745;<br>k&#257;rya&#7745; karma karoti ya&#7717;<br>sa sanny&#257;s&#299; ca yog&#299; ca<br>na niragnir na c&#257;kriya&#7717;</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;One who is unattached to the fruits of his work and who works as he is obligated is in the renounced order of life, and he is the true mystic, not he who lights no fire and performs no work.&rdquo; Whether one acts as a <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;, g&#7771;hastha, v&#257;naprastha</span> or <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;,</span> he must act only for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, V&#257;sudeva&mdash;K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the son of Vasudeva. This should be the principle for everyone&rsquo;s life. N&#257;rada Muni has already described the principles of life for a <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;ri, v&#257;naprastha</span> and <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;,</span> and now he is describing how a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> should live. The basic principle is to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purport">The science of satisfying the Supreme Lord can be learned as described here: <span class="Italic">s&#257;k&#7779;&#257;d up&#257;s&#299;ta mah&#257;-mun&#299;n.</span> The word <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mun&#299;n</span> refers to great saintly persons or devotees. Saintly persons are generally known as <span class="Italic">munis,</span> or thoughtful philosophers concerned with transcendental subject matters, and <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mun&#299;n</span> refers to those who have not only thoroughly studied the goal of life but who are actually engaged in satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead, V&#257;sudeva. These persons are known as devotees. Unless one associates with devotees, one cannot learn the science of <span class="Italic">v&#257;sudev&#257;rpa&#7751;a,</span> or dedicating one&rsquo;s life to V&#257;sudeva, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purport">In India the principles of this science were followed strictly. Even fifty years ago, I saw that in the villages of Bengal and the suburbs of Calcutta, people engaged in hearing <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> daily when all their activities ended, or at least in the evening before going to bed. Everyone would hear the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata</span> classes were held in every village, and thus people had the advantage of hearing <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> which describes everything about the aim of life&mdash;liberation or salvation.

The process, as described in many ways, is one of hearing and chanting (<span class="Italic">&#347;&#7771;&#7751;vat&#257;&#7745; sva-kath&#257;&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&#7717; pu&#7751;ya-&#347;rava&#7751;a-k&#299;rtana&#7717;</I> [SB </span></I><a href="index03ec.html?g=6478">1.2.17</a>]). Everyone, especially the <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hasthas,</span> who are <span class="Italic">m&#363;&#7693;ha-dh&#299;,</span> ignorant about the goal of life, should be given opportunities to hear about K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Simply by hearing, by attending lectures in the different centers of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, where topics of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> are discussed, they will be purified of their sinful inclination for constant indulgence in illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling, which have all become prominent in modern days. Thus they can be raised to the status of light. <span class="Italic">Pu&#7751;ya-&#347;rava&#7751;a-k&#299;rtana&#7717;.</span> Simply by joining the <span class="Italic">k&#299;rtana</span>&mdash;Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare Hare/ Hare R&#257;ma, Hare R&#257;ma, R&#257;ma R&#257;ma, Hare Hare&mdash;and by hearing about K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> one must be purified, especially if he also takes <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da.</span> This is all going on in the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement.</div>
<div class="Purport">Another specific description here is <span class="Italic">&#347;&#7771;&#7751;van bhagavato &rsquo;bh&#299;k&#7779;&#7751;am avat&#257;ra-kath&#257;m&#7771;tam.</span> It is not that because one has once finished <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> he should not hear it again. The word <span class="Italic">abh&#299;k&#7779;&#7751;am</span> is very important. We should hear again and again. There is no question of stopping: even if one has read these topics many times, he should go on reading again and again because <span class="Italic">bhagavat-kath&#257;,</span> the words spoken by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and spoken by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s devotees about K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, are <span class="Italic">am&#7771;tam,</span> nectar. The more one drinks this <span class="Italic">am&#7771;tam,</span> the more he advances in his eternal life.</div>
<div class="Purport">The human form of life is meant for liberation, but unfortunately, due to the influence of Kali-yuga, every day the <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hasthas</span> are working hard like asses. Early in the morning they rise and travel even a hundred miles away to earn bread. Especially in the Western countries, I have seen that people awaken at five o&rsquo;clock to go to offices and factories to earn their livelihood. People in Calcutta and Bombay also do this every day. They work very hard in the office or factory, and again they spend three or four hours in transportation returning home. Then they retire at ten o&rsquo;clock and again rise early in the morning to go to their offices and factories. This kind of hard labor is described in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> as the life of pigs and stool-eaters. <span class="Italic">N&#257;ya&#7745; deho deha-bh&#257;j&#257;&#7745; n&#7771;loke ka&#7779;&#7789;&#257;n k&#257;m&#257;n arhate vid-bhuj&#257;&#7745; ye:</span> &ldquo;Of all living entities who have accepted material bodies in this world, one who has been awarded this human form should not work hard day and night simply for sense gratification, which is available even for dogs and hogs that eat stool.&rdquo; (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="index42d9.html?g=42737">5.5.1</a>) One must find some time for hearing <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> and <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> This is Vedic culture. One should work eight hours at the most to earn his livelihood, and either in the afternoon or in the evening a householder should associate with devotees to hear about the incarnations of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and His activities and thus be gradually liberated from the clutches of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> However, instead of finding time to hear about K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the householders, after working hard in offices and factories, find time to go to a restaurant or a club where instead of hearing about K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and His activities they are very much pleased to hear about the political activities of demons and nondevotees and to enjoy sex, wine, women and meat and in this way waste their time. This is not <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> life, but demoniac life. The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, however, with its centers all over the world, gives such fallen and condemned persons an opportunity to hear about K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>
<div class="Purport">In a dream we form a society of friendship and love, and when we awaken we see that it has ceased to exist. Similarly, one&rsquo;s gross society, family and love are also a dream, and this dream will be over as soon as one dies. Therefore, whether one is dreaming in a subtle way or a gross way, these dreams are all false and temporary. One&rsquo;s real business is to understand that one is soul (<span class="Italic">) and that his activities should therefore be different. Then one can be happy.</div>

<div class="Translation">While working to earn his livelihood as much as necessary to maintain body and soul together, one who is actually learned should live in human society unattached to family affairs, although externally appearing very much attached.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This is the picture of ideal family life. When &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu asked R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya about the goal of life, R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya described it in different ways, according to the recommendations of the revealed scriptures, and finally &#346;r&#299; R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya explained that one may stay in his own position, whether as a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra,</span> a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> or whatever, but one must try to inquire about life&rsquo;s goal (<span class="Italic">ath&#257;to brahma jij&ntilde;&#257;s&#257;</span>). This is the proper utilization of the human form of life. When one misuses the gift of the human form by unnecessarily indulging in the animal propensities of eating, sleeping, mating and defending and does not try to get out of the clutches of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> which subjects one to repeated birth, death, old age and disease, one is again punished by being forced to descend to the lower species and undergo evolution according to the laws of nature. <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;te&#7717; kriyam&#257;&#7751;&#257;ni gu&#7751;ai&#7717; karm&#257;&#7751;i sarva&#347;a&#7717;</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index15ec.html?g=1275">3.27</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> Being completely under the grip of material nature, the living entity must evolve again from the lower species to the higher species until he at last returns to human life and gets the chance to be freed from the material clutches. A wise man, however, learns from the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> and <span class="Italic">guru</span> that we living entities are all eternal but are put into troublesome conditions because of associating with different modes under the laws of material nature. He therefore concludes that in the human form of life he should not endeavor for unnecessary necessities, but should live a very simple life, just maintaining body and soul together. Certainly one requires some means of livelihood, and according to one&rsquo;s <span class="Italic">var&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama</span> this means of livelihood is prescribed in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras.</span> One should be satisfied with this. Therefore, instead of hankering for more and more money, a sincere devotee of the Lord tries to invent some ways to earn his livelihood, and when he does so K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a helps him. Earning one&rsquo;s livelihood, therefore, is not a problem. The real problem is how to get free from the bondage of birth, death and old age. Attaining this freedom, and not inventing unnecessary necessities, is the basic principle of Vedic civilization. One should be satisfied with whatever means of life comes automatically. The modern materialistic civilization is just the opposite of the ideal civilization. Every day the so-called leaders of modern society invent something contributing to a cumbersome way of life that implicates people more and more in the cycle of birth, death, old age and disease.</div>

<div class="Translation">The natural products created by the Supreme Personality of Godhead should be utilized to maintain the bodies and souls of all living entities. The necessities of life are of three types: those produced from the sky [from rainfall], from the earth [from the mines, the seas or the fields], and from the atmosphere [that which is obtained suddenly and unexpectedly].</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">We living entities in different forms are all children of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as confirmed by the Lord in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexf156.html?g=4632">14.4</a>):</div>

One who is intelligent can see that all living entities in the 8,400,000 bodily forms are part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and are His sons. Everything within the material and spiritual worlds is the property of the Supreme Lord (<span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;&#257;v&#257;syam ida&#7745; sarvam</span>), and therefore everything has a relationship with Him. &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; says in this regard:</div>

Everything belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for everything is created by Him. All living entities, being the Lord&rsquo;s sons, His eternal parts and parcels, have the right to use their father&rsquo;s property by nature&rsquo;s arrangement. As stated in the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads, tena tyaktena bhu&ntilde;j&#299;th&#257; m&#257; g&#7771;dha&#7717; kasya svid dhanam.</span> Everyone should be satisfied with the things allotted him by the Supreme Personality of Godhead; no one should encroach upon another&rsquo;s rights or property.</div>

If people throughout the world take to the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement and chant the easy sound vibration of the transcendental name and fame of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there will be no scarcity of rainfall; consequently food grains, fruits and flowers will be properly produced, and all the necessities of life will be easily obtained. <span class="Italic">G&#7771;hasthas,</span> or householders, should take the responsibility for organizing such natural production.

According to the Vedic civilization, it should all be given to the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, as ordered by the Lord Himself in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index0526.html?g=3228">9.27</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">yat karo&#7779;i yad a&#347;n&#257;si<br>yaj juho&#7779;i dad&#257;si yat<br>yat tapasyasi kaunteya<br>tat kuru&#7779;va mad-arpa&#7751;am</div>

<div class="Purport">The <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hasthas</span> should give contributions for constructing temples of the Supreme Lord and for preaching of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, all over the world. <span class="Italic">&#346;&#7771;&#7751;van bhagavato&rsquo;bh&#299;k&#7779;&#7751;am avat&#257;ra-kath&#257;m&#7771;tam.</span> In the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span>&mdash;the <span class="Italic">pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> and other Vedic literatures&mdash;there are so many narrations describing the transcendental activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and everyone should hear them again and again. For example, even if we read the entire <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> every day, all eighteen chapters, in each reading we shall find a new explanation. That is the nature of transcendental literature. The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement therefore affords one an opportunity to spend his extra earnings for the benefit of all human society by expanding K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. In India especially we see hundreds and thousands of temples that were constructed by the wealthy men of society who did not want to be called thieves and be punished.</div>
<div class="Purport">This verse is very important. As stated here, one who accumulates more money than needed is a thief, and by the laws of nature he will be punished. One who acquires more money than necessary becomes desirous of enjoying material comforts more and more. Materialists are inventing so many artificial necessities, and those who have money, being allured by such artificial necessities, try to accumulate money to possess more and more. This is the idea of modern economic development. Everyone is engaged in earning money, and the money is kept in the bank, which then offers money to the public. In this cycle of activities, everyone is engaged in getting more and more money, and therefore the ideal goal of human life is being lost. Concisely, it may be said that everyone is a thief and is liable to be punished. Punishment by the laws of nature takes place in the cycle of birth and death. No one dies fully satisfied by the fulfillment of material desires, for that is not possible. Therefore at the time of one&rsquo;s death one is very sorry, being unable to fulfill his desires. By the laws of nature one is then offered another body to fulfill his unsatisfied desires, and upon taking birth again, accepting another material body, one voluntarily accepts the threefold miseries of life.</div>

<div class="Translation">One should treat animals such as deer, camels, asses, monkeys, mice, snakes, birds and flies exactly like one&rsquo;s own son. How little difference there actually is between children and these innocent animals.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">One who is in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness understands that there is no difference between the animals and the innocent children in one&rsquo;s home. Even in ordinary life, it is our practical experience that a household dog or cat is regarded on the same level as one&rsquo;s children, without any envy. Like children, the unintelligent animals are also sons of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious person, even though a householder, should not discriminate between children and poor animals. Unfortunately, modern society has devised many means for killing animals in different forms of life. For example, in the agricultural fields there may be many mice, flies and other creatures that disturb production, and sometimes they are killed by pesticides. In this verse, however, such killing is forbidden. Every living entity should be nourished by the food given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Human society should not consider itself the only enjoyer of all the properties of God; rather, men should understand that all the other animals also have a claim to God&rsquo;s property. In this verse even the snake is mentioned, indicating that a householder should not be envious even of a snake. If everyone is fully satisfied by eating food that is a gift from the Lord, why should there be envy between one living being and another? In modern days people are very much inclined toward communistic ideas of society, but we do not think that there can be any better communistic idea than that which is explained in this verse of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> Even in the communistic countries the poor animals are killed without consideration, although they also should have the right to take their allotted food with which to live.</div>

Even in householder life, one should be satisfied to maintain body and soul together with whatever is available with minimum endeavor, according to place and time, by the grace of the Lord. One should not engage oneself in ugra-karma.<span class="Italic"></span></div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In human life there are four principles to be fulfilled&mdash;<span class="Italic">dharma, artha, k&#257;ma</span> and <span class="Italic">mok&#7779;a</span> (religion, economic development, sense gratification, and liberation). First one should be religious, observing various rules and regulations, and then one must earn some money for maintenance of his family and the satisfaction of his senses. The most important ceremony for sense gratification is marriage because sexual intercourse is one of the principal necessities of the material body. <span class="Italic">Yan maithun&#257;di-g&#7771;hamedhi-sukha&#7745; hi tuccham</I> [SB </span></I><a href="indexaa4a.html?g=57238">7.9.45</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> Although sexual intercourse is not a very exalted requisite in life, both animals and men require some sense gratification because of material propensities. One should be satisfied with married life and not expend energy for extra sense gratification or sex life.</div>
<div class="Purport">As for economic development, the responsibility for this should be entrusted mainly to the <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas</span> and <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hasthas.</span> Human society should be divided into <span class="Italic">var&#7751;as</span> and <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;ramas&mdash;br&#257;hma&#7751;a, k&#7779;atriya, vai&#347;ya, &#347;&#363;dra, brahmacarya, g&#7771;hastha, v&#257;naprastha</span> and <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa.</span> Economic development is necessary for <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hasthas.</span> <span class="Italic">Br&#257;hma&#7751;a g&#7771;hasthas</span> should be satisfied with a life of <span class="Italic">adhyayana, adhy&#257;pana, yajana</span> and <span class="Italic">y&#257;jana</span>&mdash;being learned scholars, teaching others to be scholars, learning how to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and also teaching others how to worship Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, or even the demigods. A <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> should do this without remuneration, but he is allowed to accept charity from a person whom he teaches how to be a human being. As for the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas,</span> they are supposed to be the kings of the land, and the land should be distributed to the <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas</span> for agricultural activities, cow protection and trade. <span class="Italic">&#346;&#363;dras</span> must work; sometimes they should engage in occupational duties as cloth manufacturers, weavers, blacksmiths, goldsmiths, brass-smiths, and so on, or else they should engage in hard labor to produce food grains.</div>
<div class="Purport">These are the different occupational duties by which men should earn their livelihood, and in this way human society should be simple. At the present moment, however, everyone is engaged in technological advancement, which is described in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as <span class="Italic">ugra-karma</span>&mdash;extremely severe endeavor. This <span class="Italic">ugra-karma</span> is the cause of agitation within the human mind. Men are engaging in many sinful activities and becoming degraded by opening slaughterhouses, breweries and cigarette factories, as well as nightclubs and other establishments for sense enjoyment. In this way they are spoiling their lives. In all of these activities, of course, householders are involved, and therefore it is advised here, with the use of the word <span class="Italic">api,</span> that even though one is a householder, one should not engage himself in severe hardships. One&rsquo;s means of livelihood should be extremely simple. As for those who are not <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hasthas</span>&mdash;the <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;s, v&#257;naprasthas</span> and <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s</span>&mdash;they don&rsquo;t have to do anything but strive for advancement in spiritual life. This means that three fourths of the entire population should stop sense gratification and simply be engaged in the advancement of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. Only one fourth of the population should be <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha,</span> and that should be according to laws of restricted sense gratification. The <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hasthas, v&#257;naprasthas, brahmac&#257;r&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s</span> should endeavor together with their total energy to become K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious. This type of civilization is called <span class="Italic">daiva-var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama.</span> One of the objectives of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is to establish this <span class="Italic">daiva-var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama,</span> but not to encourage so-called <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</span> without scientifically organized endeavor by human society.</div>

Even one&rsquo;s wife at home, with whom one is most intimately attached, should be offered for the reception of guests and people in general.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Although in modern society the dog is accepted as part of one&rsquo;s household paraphernalia, in the Vedic system of household life the dog is untouchable; as mentioned here, a dog may be maintained with proper food, but it cannot be allowed to enter one&rsquo;s house, what to speak of the bedroom. Outcastes or untouchable <span class="Italic">ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;las</span> should also be provided with the necessities for life. The word used in this connection is <span class="Italic">yath&#257;,</span> which means &ldquo;as much as deserved.&rdquo; The outcastes should not be given money with which to indulge in more than they need, for otherwise they will misuse it. At the present moment, for example, low-class men are generally paid quite amply, but instead of using their money to cultivate knowledge and advance in life, such low-class men use their extra money for wine-drinking and similar sinful activities. As mentioned in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexd112.html?g=1541">4.13</a>), <span class="Italic">c&#257;tur-var&#7751;ya&#7745; may&#257; s&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;a&#7745; gu&#7751;a-karma-vibh&#257;ga&#347;a&#7717;:</span> there must be four divisions of human society according to the work and qualities of men. Men with the lowest qualities cannot do any work that requires higher intelligence. However, although such a division of men must exist according to their quality and work, it is suggested herewith that everyone must have the necessities of life. The communists of the present day are in favor of supplying the necessities of life to everyone, but they consider only the human beings and not the lower animals. The <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam&rsquo;s</span> principles are so broad, however, that it recommends that the necessities of life be supplied to everyone, man or animal, regardless of good or bad qualities.</div>
<div class="Purport">The idea of giving even one&rsquo;s wife to the service of the public is that one&rsquo;s intimate relationship with his wife, or one&rsquo;s excessive attachment for his wife, by which one thinks his wife to be his better half or to be identical with himself, must gradually be given up. As formerly suggested, the idea of ownership, even of one&rsquo;s family, must be abandoned. The dream of material life is the cause of bondage in the cycle of birth and death, and therefore one should give up this dream. Consequently, in the human form of life one&rsquo;s attachment for his wife should be given up, as suggested herein.</div>

<div class="First">The word <span class="Italic">ayana</span> means &ldquo;path&rdquo; or &ldquo;going.&rdquo; The six months when the sun moves toward the north are called <span class="Italic">uttar&#257;ya&#7751;a,</span> or the northern path, and the six months when it moves south are called <span class="Italic">dak&#7779;i&#7751;&#257;yana,</span> or the southern path. These are mentioned in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexadaf.html?g=2947">8.24</a>&ndash;25). The first day when the sun begins to move north and enter the zodiacal sign of Capricorn is called Makara-sa&#7749;kr&#257;nti, and the first day when the sun begins to move south and enter the sign of Cancer is called Karka&#7789;a-sa&#7749;kr&#257;nti.

<div class="Purport">Vi&#7779;uva, or Vi&#7779;uva-sa&#7749;kr&#257;nti, means Me&#7779;a-sa&#7749;kr&#257;nti, or the day on which the sun enters the sign Aries. Tul&#257;-sa&#7749;kr&#257;nti is the day on which the sun enters the sign Libra. Both of these days occur only once within a year. The word <span class="Italic">yoga</span> refers to a certain relationship between the sun and moon as they move in the sky. There are twenty-seven different degrees of <span class="Italic">yoga,</span> of which the seventeenth is called Vyat&#299;p&#257;ta. On the day when this occurs, one should perform the <span class="Italic">&#347;r&#257;ddha</span> ceremony. A <span class="Italic">tithi,</span> or lunar day, consists of the distance between the longitude of the sun and that of the moon. Sometimes a <span class="Italic">tithi</span> is less than twenty-four hours. When it starts after sunrise on a certain day and ends before the sunrise of the following day, the previous <span class="Italic">tithi</span> and the following <span class="Italic">tithi</span> both &ldquo;touch&rdquo; the twenty-four-hour day between the sunrises.

<div class="Translation">N&#257;rada Muni continued: Now I shall describe the places where religious performances may be well executed. Any place where a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is available is an excellent place for all auspicious activities. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the support of this entire cosmic manifestation, with all its moving and nonmoving living entities, and the temple where the Deity of the Lord is installed is a most sacred place. Furthermore, places where learned br&#257;hma&#7751;as observe Vedic principles by means of austerity, education and mercy are also most auspicious and sacred.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In this verse it is indicated that a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava temple where the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, is worshiped, and where Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas are engaged in the service of the Lord, is the best sacred place for performing any religious ceremonies. At the present day, especially in big, big cities, people live in small apartments and are not able to establish a Deity or temple. Under the circumstances, therefore, the centers and temples being established by the expanding K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement are the best sacred places for performing religious ceremonies. Although people in general are no longer interested in religious ceremonies or Deity worship, the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement gives everyone the chance to advance in spiritual life by becoming K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious.</div>

<div class="Translation">Auspicious indeed are the places where there is a temple of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, in which He is duly worshiped, and also the places where there flow the celebrated sacred rivers mentioned in the Pur&#257;&#7751;as, the supplementary Vedic literatures. Anything spiritual done there is certainly very effective.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">There are many atheists who oppose the worship of the Deity of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the temple. In this verse, however, it is authoritatively stated that any place where the Deity is worshiped is transcendental; it does not belong to the material world. It is also said that the forest is in the mode of goodness, and therefore those who want to cultivate spiritual life are advised to go to the forest (<span class="Italic">vana&#7745; gato yad dharim &#257;&#347;rayeta</I> [SB </span></I><a href="indexd2be.html?g=55189">7.5.5</a>]). But one should not go to the forest simply to live like a monkey. Monkeys and other ferocious animals also live in the forest, but a person who goes to the forest for spiritual culture must accept the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as shelter (<span class="Italic">vana&#7745; gato yad dharim &#257;&#347;rayeta</I> [SB </span></I><a href="indexd2be.html?g=55189">7.5.5</a>]). One should not be satisfied simply to go to the forest; one must take shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this age, therefore, since it is impossible to go to the forest for spiritual culture, one is recommended to live in the temple community as a devotee, regularly worship the Deity, follow the regulative principles and thus make the place like Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha. The forest may be in goodness, the cities and villages in passion, and the brothels, hotels and restaurants in ignorance, but when one lives in the temple community he lives in Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha. Therefore it is said here, <span class="Italic">&#347;reyas&#257;&#7745; padam:</span> it is the best, most auspicious place.</div>
<div class="Purport">In many places throughout the world we are constructing communities to give shelter to devotees and worship the Deity in the temple. The Deity cannot be worshiped except by devotees. Temple worshipers who fail to give importance to the devotees are third class. They are <span class="Italic">kani&#7779;&#7789;ha-adhik&#257;r&#299;s</span> in the lower stage of spiritual life. As it is said in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (11.2.47):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">arc&#257;y&#257;m eva haraye<br>p&#363;j&#257;&#7745; ya&#7717; &#347;raddhayehate<br>na tad-bhakte&#7779;u c&#257;nye&#7779;u<br>sa bhakta&#7717; pr&#257;k&#7771;ta&#7717; sm&#7771;ta&#7717;</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;A person who is very faithfully engaged in the worship of the Deity in the temple but does not know how to behave toward devotees or people in general is called a <span class="Italic">pr&#257;k&#7771;ta-bhakta,</span> or <span class="Italic">kani&#7779;&#7789;ha-adhik&#257;r&#299;.</span>&rdquo; Therefore, in the temple there must be the Deity of the Lord, and the Lord should be worshiped by the devotees. This combination of the devotees and the Deity creates a first-class transcendental place.</div>
<div class="Purport">Aside from this, if a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> devotee worships the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;lagr&#257;ma-&#347;il&#257;,</span> or the form of the Deity at home, his home also becomes a very great place. It was therefore customary for members of the three higher classes&mdash;namely the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as, k&#7779;atriyas</span> and <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas</span>&mdash;to worship the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;lagr&#257;ma-&#347;il&#257;,</span> or a small Deity of R&#257;dh&#257;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a or S&#299;t&#257;-R&#257;ma in each and every home. This made everything auspicious. But now they have given up the Deity worship. Men have become modernized and are consequently indulging in all sorts of sinful activities, and therefore they are extremely unhappy.</div>
<div class="Purport">According to Vedic civilization, therefore, the holy places of pilgrimage are considered most sacred, and still there are hundreds and thousands of holy places like Jagann&#257;tha Pur&#299;, V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, Hardwar, R&#257;me&#347;vara, Pray&#257;ga and Mathur&#257;. India is the place for worshiping or for cultivating spiritual life. The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement invites everyone from all over the world, without discrimination as to caste or creed, to come to its centers and cultivate spiritual life perfectly.</div>

Gradually, however, because of material contamination with the advance of the ages, disrespectful dealings appeared even among <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas. Actually, an advanced Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is to be respected more than Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. As stated in the <span class="Italic">Padma Pur&#257;&#7751;a, &#257;r&#257;dhan&#257;n&#257;&#7745; sarve&#7779;&#257;&#7745; vi&#7779;&#7751;or &#257;r&#257;dhana&#7745; param:</span> of all kinds of worship, worship of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is the best. <span class="Italic">Tasm&#257;t paratara&#7745; devi tad&#299;y&#257;n&#257;&#7745; samarcanam:</span> and recommended more than worship of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is worship of the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava.</div>
<div class="Purport">Formerly, all activities were performed in connection with Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, but after Satya-yuga there were symptoms of disrespectful dealings among Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas. &#346;r&#299;la Bhaktivinoda &#7788;h&#257;kura has said that a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is he who has helped others become Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas. An example of one who has converted many others into Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas is N&#257;rada Muni. A powerful Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava who has converted others into Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas is to be worshiped, but because of material contamination, sometimes such an exalted Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is disrespected by other, minor Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas. When great saintly persons saw this contamination, they introduced worship of the Deity in the temple. This began in Tret&#257;-yuga and was especially prominent in Dv&#257;para-yuga (<span class="Italic">dv&#257;pare paricary&#257;y&#257;&#7745;</span>). But in Kali-yuga, worship of the Deity is being neglected. Therefore chanting of the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra</span> is more powerful than Deity worship. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu set a practical example in that He did not establish any temples or Deities, but He profusely introduced the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> movement. Therefore K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness preachers should give more stress to the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> movement, especially by distributing transcendental literature more and more. This helps the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> movement. Whenever there is a possibility to worship the Deity, we may establish many centers, but generally we should give more stress to the distribution of transcendental literature, for this will be more effective in converting people to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness.</div>

<div class="Translation">My dear King, of all persons a qualified br&#257;hma&#7751;a must be accepted as the best within this material world because such a br&#257;hma&#7751;a, by practicing austerity, Vedic studies and satisfaction, becomes the counterpart body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">From the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> we learn that the Personality of Godhead is the Supreme Person. Every living entity is an individual person, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, is the Supreme Person. A <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> who is well versed in Vedic knowledge and fully conversant with transcendental matters becomes a representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore one should worship such a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> or Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. A Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is superior to a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> because whereas a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> knows that he is Brahman, not matter, a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava knows that he is not only Brahman but also an eternal servant of the Supreme Brahman. Therefore, worship of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is superior to worship of the Deity in the temple. Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura says, <span class="Italic">s&#257;k&#7779;&#257;d dharitvena samasta-&#347;&#257;strai&#7717;:</span> in all the scriptures the spiritual master, who is the best of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> the best of the Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas, is considered to be as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This does not mean, however, that the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava thinks himself God, for this is blasphemous. Although a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> or Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is worshiped as being as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, such a devotee always remains a faithful servant of the Lord and never tries to enjoy the prestige that might accrue to him from being the Supreme Lord&rsquo;s representative.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The summary of the Fifteenth Chapter is as follows. In the previous chapter, &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada Muni proved the importance of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> in society. Now, in this chapter, he will show the differences between different grades of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> Among the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> some are householders and are mostly attached to fruitive activities or the betterment of social conditions. Above them, however, are <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> who are very much attracted by austerities and penances and who retire from family life. They are known as <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprasthas.</span> Other <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are very much interested in studying the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and explaining the purport of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> to others. Such <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are called <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;s.</span> And still other <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are interested in different types of <span class="Italic">yoga,</span> especially <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> and <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na-yoga.</span> Such <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are mostly <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s,</span> members of the renounced order of life.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">As far as householders are concerned, they engage in different types of scriptural activities, especially in offering oblations to their forefathers and giving as charity to other <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> the paraphernalia engaged in such sacrifices. Generally the charity is given to <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s, br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> in the renounced order of life. If such a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> is not available, the charity is given to <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> householders engaged in fruitive activities.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">One should not make very elaborate arrangements to perform the <span class="Italic">&#347;r&#257;ddha</span> ceremony of offering oblations to one&rsquo;s forefathers. The best process for the <span class="Italic">&#347;r&#257;ddha</span> ceremony is to distribute <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavata-pras&#257;da</span> (remnants of food that has first been offered to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a) to all of one&rsquo;s forefathers and relatives. This makes a first-class <span class="Italic">&#347;r&#257;ddha</span> ceremony. In the <span class="Italic">&#347;r&#257;ddha</span> ceremony there is no need to offer meat or eat meat. Unnecessary killing of animals must be avoided. Those who are in the lower grades of society prefer to perform sacrifices by killing animals, but one who is advanced in knowledge must avoid such unnecessary violence.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Italic">Br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> should execute their regulative duties in worshiping Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Those who are advanced in knowledge of religious principles must avoid five kinds of irreligion, known as <span class="Italic">vidharma, para-dharma, dharm&#257;bh&#257;sa, upadharma</span> and <span class="Italic">chala-dharma.</span> One must act according to the religious principles that suit his constitutional position; it is not that everyone must adhere to the same type of religion. A general principle is that a poor man should not unnecessarily endeavor for economic development. One who refrains from such endeavors but who engages in devotional service is most auspicious.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">One who is not satisfied with the mind must fall to degradation. One must conquer lusty desires, anger, greed, fear, lamentation, illusion, fright, unnecessary talks on material subjects, violence, the four miseries of material existence, and the three material qualities. That is the objective of human life. One who has no faith in the spiritual master, who is identical with &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, cannot get any benefit from reading <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra.</span> One should never consider the spiritual master an ordinary human being, even though the members of the spiritual master&rsquo;s family may think of him as such. Meditation and other processes of austerity are useful only if they help in advancement toward K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness; otherwise, they are simply a waste of time and labor. For those who are not devotees, such meditation and austerity cause falldown.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Every householder should be very careful because even though a householder may try to conquer the senses, he becomes a victim to the association of relatives and falls down. Thus a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> must become a <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha</span> or <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;,</span> live in a secluded place, and be satisfied with food gotten by begging from door to door. He must chant the <span class="Italic">o&#7745;k&#257;ra mantra</span> or Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> and in this way he will perceive transcendental bliss within himself. After taking <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa,</span> however, if one returns to <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> life, he is called a <span class="Italic">v&#257;nt&#257;&#347;&#299;,</span> which means &ldquo;one who eats his own vomit.&rdquo; Such a person is shameless. A householder should not give up the ritualistic ceremonies, and a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> should not live in society. If a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> is agitated by the senses, he is a cheater influenced by the modes of passion and ignorance. When one assumes a role in goodness by starting philanthropic and altruistic activities, such activities become impediments on the path of devotional service.</div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The best process for advancing in devotional service is to abide by the orders of the spiritual master, for only by his direction can one conquer the senses. Unless one is completely K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious, there is a chance of falling down. Of course, in performing ritualistic ceremonies and other fruitive activities there are also many dangers at every moment. Fruitive activities have been divided into twelve portions. Because of performing fruitive activities, which are called the path of <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> one has to accept the cycle of birth and death, but when one takes the path of <span class="Italic">mok&#7779;a,</span> or liberation, which is described in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as <span class="Italic">arcan&#257;-m&#257;rga,</span> one can get relief from the cycle of birth and death. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> describe these two paths as <span class="Italic">pit&#7771;-y&#257;na</span> and <span class="Italic">deva-y&#257;na.</span> Those who follow the paths of <span class="Italic">pit&#7771;-y&#257;na</span> and <span class="Italic">deva-y&#257;na</span> are never bewildered, even while in the material body. A monistic philosopher who gradually develops control of the senses understands that the objective of all the different <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;ramas,</span> the statuses of life, is salvation. One must live and act according to <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras.</span></div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">If one who is performing the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies becomes a devotee, even if he is a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha,</span> he can receive the causeless mercy of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The objective of a devotee is to return home, back to Godhead. Such a devotee, even though not performing ritualistic ceremonies, advances in spiritual consciousness by the supreme will of the Personality of Godhead. One may actually become successful in spiritual consciousness by the mercy of devotees, or one may fall from spiritual consciousness by being disrespectful to devotees. In this regard, N&#257;rada Muni narrated the history of how he had fallen from the Gandharva kingdom, how he was born in a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> family, and how by serving exalted <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> he become the son of Lord Brahm&#257; and was reinstated in his transcendental position. After narrating all these stories, N&#257;rada Muni praised the mercy received from the Lord by the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, after hearing from N&#257;rada, become ecstatic in love of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and then N&#257;rada Muni left that place and returned to his own place. Thus &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, having described various descendants of the daughters of Dak&#7779;a, ends the Seventh Canto of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span></div>

The process of <span class="Italic">&#257;jagara-v&#7771;tti,</span> the means of livelihood of a python, is very much appreciated in this regard.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">For spiritual advancement, one should be materially satisfied, for if one is not materially satisfied, his greed for material development will result in the frustration of his spiritual advancement. There are two things that nullify all good qualities. One is poverty. <span class="Italic">Daridra-do&#7779;o gu&#7751;a-r&#257;&#347;i-n&#257;&#347;&#299;.</span> If one is poverty-stricken, all his good qualities become null and void. Similarly, if one becomes too greedy, his good qualifications are lost. Therefore the adjustment is that one should not be poverty-stricken, but one must try to be fully satisfied with the bare necessities of life and not be greedy. For a devotee to be satisfied with the bare necessities is therefore the best advice for spiritual advancement. Learned authorities in devotional life consequently advise that one not endeavor to increase the number of temples and <span class="Italic">ma&#7789;has.</span> Such activities can be undertaken only by devotees experienced in propagating the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement. All the <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> in South India, especially &#346;r&#299; R&#257;m&#257;nuj&#257;c&#257;rya, constructed many big temples, and in North India all the Gosv&#257;m&#299;s of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana constructed large temples. &#346;r&#299;la Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura also constructed large centers, known as Gau&#7693;&#299;ya Ma&#7789;has. Therefore temple construction is not bad, provided proper care is taken for the propagation of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. Even if such endeavors are considered greedy, the greed is to satisfy K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and therefore these are spiritual activities.</div>

<div class="First">&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura has suggested how one can conquer lusty desires for sense gratification. One cannot give up thinking of women, for thinking in this way is natural; even while walking on the street, one will see so many women. However, if one is determined not to live with a woman, even while seeing a woman he will not become lusty. If one is determined not to have sex, he can automatically conquer lusty desires. The example given in this regard is that even if one is hungry, if on a particular day he is determined to observe fasting, he can naturally conquer the disturbances of hunger and thirst. If one is determined not to be envious of anyone, he can naturally conquer anger. Similarly, one can give up the desire to accumulate wealth simply by considering how difficult it is to protect the money in one&rsquo;s possession. If one keeps a large amount of cash with him, he is always anxious about keeping it properly. Thus if one discusses the disadvantages of accumulating wealth, he can naturally give up business without difficulty.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The example of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s being the Supreme Personality of Godhead is appropriate in regard to understanding the spiritual master. The spiritual master is called <span class="Italic">sevaka-bhagav&#257;n,</span> the servitor Personality of Godhead, and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is called <span class="Italic">sevya-bhagav&#257;n,</span> the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is to be worshiped. The spiritual master is the worshiper God, whereas the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, is the worshipable God. This is the difference between the spiritual master and the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purport">Another point: <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> which constitutes the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is presented by the spiritual master as it is, without deviation. Therefore the Absolute Truth is present in the spiritual master. As clearly stated in Text 26, <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na-d&#299;pa-prade.</span> The Supreme Personality of Godhead gives real knowledge to the entire world, and the spiritual master, as the representative of the Supreme Godhead, carries the message throughout the world. Therefore, on the absolute platform, there is no difference between the spiritual master and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If someone considers the Supreme Personality&mdash;K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a or Lord R&#257;macandra&mdash;to be an ordinary human being, this does not mean that the Lord becomes an ordinary human being. Similarly, if the family members of the spiritual master, who is the bona fide representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, consider the spiritual master an ordinary human being, this does not mean that he becomes an ordinary human being. The spiritual master is as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore one who is very serious about spiritual advancement must regard the spiritual master in this way. Even a slight deviation from this understanding can create disaster in the disciple&rsquo;s Vedic studies and austerities.</div>

<div class="Translation">Ritualistic ceremonies, regulative principles, austerities and the practice of yoga are all meant to control the senses and mind, but even after one is able to control the senses and mind, if he does not come to the point of meditation upon the Supreme Lord, all such activities are simply labor in frustration.</div>

<div class="First">If one becomes very rich through his professional activities, through trade or through agriculture, this does not mean that he is spiritually advanced. To be spiritually advanced is different from being materially rich. Although the purpose of life is to become spiritually rich, unfortunate men, misguided as they are, are always engaged in trying to become materially rich. Such material engagements, however, do not help one in the actual fulfillment of the human mission. On the contrary, material engagements lead one to be attracted to many unnecessary necessities, which are accompanied by the risk that one may be born in a degraded condition.

When this practice of <span class="Italic">yoga</span> is perfect, one sees the Supersoul, the Param&#257;tm&#257; feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, within the core of one&rsquo;s heart. However, in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexfcdb.html?g=2458">6.47</a>) the Supreme Lord says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">yogin&#257;m api sarve&#7779;&#257;m<br>mad-gaten&#257;ntar&#257;tman&#257;<br>&#347;raddh&#257;v&#257;n bhajate yo m&#257;&#7745;<br>sa me yuktatamo mata&#7717;</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Of all <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s,</span> he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in <span class="Italic">yoga</span> and is the highest of all.&rdquo; A devotee can immediately become a perfect <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> because he practices keeping K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a constantly within the core of his heart. This is another way to practice <span class="Italic">yoga</span> easily. The Lord says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">man-man&#257; bhava mad-bhakto<br>mad-y&#257;j&#299; m&#257;&#7745; namaskuru</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Always think of Me and become My devotee. Worship Me and offer your homage unto Me.&rdquo; (Bg. <a href="index673b.html?g=5988">18.65</a>) If one practices devotional service by always keeping K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a within the core of his heart (<span class="Italic">man-man&#257;&#7717;</span>), he immediately becomes a first-class <span class="Italic">yog&#299;.</span> Furthermore, keeping K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a within the mind is not a difficult task for the devotee. For an ordinary man in the bodily concept of life, the practice of <span class="Italic">yoga</span> may be helpful, but one who immediately takes to devotional service can immediately become a perfect <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> without difficulty.</div>

<div class="First"><span class="Italic">Nirv&#257;&#7751;a</span> means the cessation of all material desires. Sometimes desirelessness is understood to imply an end to the workings of the mind, but this is not possible. The living entity has senses, and if the senses stopped working, the living entity would no longer be a living entity; he would be exactly like stone or wood. This is not possible. Because he is living, he is <span class="Italic">nitya</span> and <span class="Italic">cetana</span>&mdash;eternally sentient. For those who are not very advanced, the practice of <span class="Italic">yoga</span> is recommended in order to stop the mind from being agitated by material desires, but if one fixes his mind on the lotus feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, his mind naturally becomes peaceful very soon. This peace is described in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index2ceb.html?g=2055">5.29</a>):</div>

<div class="Translation">The human form of body is meant for understanding the self and the Supreme Self, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, both of whom are transcendentally situated.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Of course, everyone in this material world is interested in maintaining the body for sense gratification, but by cultivating knowledge one should gradually understand that the body is not the self. Both the soul and the Supersoul are transcendental to the material world. This is to be understood in the human form of life, especially when one takes <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa.</span> A <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;,</span> one who has understood the self, should be engaged in elevating the self and associating with the Superself.

Seeking such elevation is one&rsquo;s duty in the human form of life. Unless one performs this duty, why should one maintain the body? Especially if a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> not only maintains the body by ordinary means but does everything to maintain the body, including even eating meat and other abominable things, he must be a <span class="Italic">lampa&#7789;a&#7717;,</span> a greedy person simply engaged in sense gratification. A <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> must specifically remove himself from the urges of the tongue, belly and genitals, which disturb one as long as one is not fully aware that the body is separate from the soul.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Transcendentalists who are advanced in knowledge compare the body, which is made by the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to a chariot. The senses are like the horses; the mind, the master of the senses, is like the reins; the objects of the senses are the destinations; intelligence is the chariot driver; and consciousness, which spreads throughout the body, is the cause of bondage in this material world.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">For a bewildered person in the materialistic way of life, the body, the mind and the senses, which are engaged in sense gratification, are the cause of bondage to repeated birth, death, old age and disease. But for one who is advanced in spiritual knowledge, the same body, senses and mind are the cause of liberation. This is confirmed in the <span class="Ref_Italic">Ka&#7789;ha Upani&#7779;ad</span> (1.3.3&ndash;4,9) as follows:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">&#257;tm&#257;na&#7745; rathina&#7745; viddhi<br>&#347;ar&#299;ra&#7745; ratham eva ca<br>buddhi&#7745; tu s&#257;rathi&#7745; viddhi<br>mana&#7717; pragraham eva ca</div>

<div class="After-Verse">The soul is the occupant of the chariot of the body, of which the driver is the intelligence. The mind is the determination to reach the destination, the senses are the horses, and the sense objects are also included in that activity. Thus one can reach the destination, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, who is <span class="Italic">parama&#7745; padam,</span> the supreme goal of life. In conditioned life the consciousness in the body is the cause of bondage, but the same consciousness, when transformed into K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, becomes the cause for one&rsquo;s returning home, back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purport">The human body, therefore, may be used in two ways&mdash;for going to the darkest regions of ignorance or for going forward, back home, back to Godhead. To go back to Godhead, the path is <span class="Italic">mahat-sev&#257;,</span> to accept the self-realized spiritual master. <span class="Italic">Mahat-sev&#257;&#7745; dv&#257;ram &#257;hur vimukte&#7717;</I> [SB </span></I><a href="index2715.html?g=42747">5.5.2</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> For liberation, one should accept the direction of authorized devotees who can actually endow one with perfect knowledge. On the other hand, <span class="Italic">tamo-dv&#257;ra&#7745; yo&#7779;it&#257;&#7745; sa&#7749;gi-sa&#7749;gam:</span> if one wants to go to the darkest regions of material existence, one may continue to associate with persons who are attached to women (<span class="Italic">yo&#7779;it&#257;&#7745; sa&#7749;gi-sa&#7749;gam</span>). The word <span class="Italic">yo&#7779;it</span> means &ldquo;woman.&rdquo; Persons who are too materialistic are attached to women.</div>
<div class="Purport">It is said, therefore, <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;na&#7745; rathina&#7745; viddhi &#347;ar&#299;ra&#7745; ratham eva ca.</span> The body is just like a chariot or car in which one may go anywhere. One may drive well, or else one may drive whimsically, in which case it is quite possible that he may have an accident and fall into a ditch. In other words, if one takes directions from the experienced spiritual master one can go back home, back to Godhead; otherwise, one may return to the cycle of birth and death. Therefore K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a personally advises:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">a&#347;raddadh&#257;n&#257;&#7717; puru&#7779;&#257;<br>dharmasy&#257;sya parantapa<br>apr&#257;pya m&#257;&#7745; nivartante<br>m&#7771;tyu-sa&#7745;s&#257;ra-vartmani</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Those who are not faithful on the path of devotional service cannot attain Me, O conqueror of foes, but return to birth and death in this material world.&rdquo; (Bg. <a href="index508f.html?g=3012">9.3</a>) The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, personally gives instructions on how one can return home, back to Godhead, but if one does not care to listen to His instructions, the result will be that one will never go back to Godhead, but will continue life in this miserable condition of repeated birth and death in material existence (<span class="Italic">m&#7771;tyu-sa&#7745;s&#257;ra-vartmani</span>).</div>
<div class="Purport">The advice of experienced transcendentalists, therefore, is that the body be fully engaged for achieving the ultimate goal of life (<span class="Italic">sv&#257;rtha-gatim</span>). The real interest or goal of life is to return home, back to Godhead. To enable one to fulfill this purpose, there are so many Vedic literatures, including <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra,</span> the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads, Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> and the <span class="Italic">R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a.</span> One should take lessons from these Vedic literatures and learn how to practice <span class="Italic">niv&#7771;tti-m&#257;rga.</span> Then one&rsquo;s life will be perfect. The body is important as long as it has consciousness. Without consciousness, the body is merely a lump of matter. Therefore, to return home, back to Godhead, one must change his consciousness from material consciousness to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. One&rsquo;s consciousness is the cause of material bondage, but if this consciousness is purified by <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> one can then understand the falsity of his <span class="Italic">up&#257;dhi,</span> his designations as Indian, American, Hindu, Muslim, Christian and so on. <span class="Italic">Sarvop&#257;dhi-vinirmukta&#7745; tat-paratvena nirmalam</span></I> [Cc. Madhya </I><a href="index663c.html?g=124289">19.170</a></I>]<span class="Italic"></I>.</span> One must forget these designations and use this consciousness only for the service of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Therefore if one takes advantage of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, his life is certainly successful.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">The ten kinds of air acting within the body are compared to the spokes of the chariot&rsquo;s wheels, and the top and bottom of the wheel itself are called religion and irreligion. The living entity in the bodily concept of life is the owner of the chariot. The Vedic mantra pra&#7751;ava is the bow, the pure living entity himself is the arrow, and the target is the Supreme Being.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Ten kinds of life air always flow within the material body. They are called <span class="Italic">pr&#257;&#7751;a, ap&#257;na, sam&#257;na, vy&#257;na, ud&#257;na, n&#257;ga, k&#363;rma, k&#7771;kala, devadatta</span> and <span class="Italic">dhana&ntilde;jaya.</span> They are compared here to the spokes of the chariot&rsquo;s wheels. The life air is the energy for all of a living being&rsquo;s activities, which are sometimes religious and sometimes irreligious. Thus religion and irreligion are said to be the upper and lower portions of the chariot&rsquo;s wheels. When the living entity decides to go back home, back to Godhead, his target is Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the conditioned state of life, one does not understand that the goal of life is the Supreme Lord. <span class="Italic">Na te vidu&#7717; sv&#257;rtha-gati&#7745; hi vi&#7779;&#7751;u&#7745; dur&#257;&#347;ay&#257; ye bahir-artha-m&#257;nina&#7717;</I> [SB </span></I><a href="index2706.html?g=55424">7.5.31</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> The living entity tries to be happy within this material world, not understanding the target of his life. When he is purified, however, he gives up his bodily conception of life and his false identity as belonging to a certain community, a certain nation, a certain society, a certain family and so on (<span class="Italic">sarvop&#257;dhi-vinirmukta&#7745; tat-paratvena nirmalam</span></I> [Cc. Madhya </I><a href="index663c.html?g=124289">19.170</a></I>]</I>). Then he takes the arrow of his purified life, and with the help of the bow&mdash;the transcendental chanting of <span class="Italic">pra&#7751;ava,</span> or the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra</span>&mdash;he throws himself toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura has commented that because the words &ldquo;bow&rdquo; and &ldquo;arrow&rdquo; are used in this verse, one might argue that the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entity have become enemies. However, although the Supreme Personality of Godhead may become the so-called enemy of the living being, this is His chivalrous pleasure. For example, the Lord fought with Bh&#299;&#7779;ma, and when Bh&#299;&#7779;ma pierced the Lord&rsquo;s body on the Battlefield of Kuruk&#7779;etra, this was a kind of humor or relationship, of which there are twelve. When the conditioned soul tries to reach the Lord by hurling an arrow at Him, the Lord takes pleasure, and the living entity gains the profit of going back home, back to Godhead. Another example given in this regard is that Arjuna, as a result of piercing the <span class="Italic">&#257;dh&#257;ra-m&#299;na,</span> or the fish within the <span class="Italic">cakra,</span> achieved the valuable gain of Draupad&#299;. Similarly, if with the arrow of chanting the holy name of the Lord one pierces Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&rsquo;s lotus feet, by dint of performing this heroic activity of devotional service one receives the benefit of returning home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">In the conditioned stage, one&rsquo;s conceptions of life are sometimes polluted by passion and ignorance, which are exhibited by attachment, hostility, greed, lamentation, illusion, fear, madness, false prestige, insults, fault-finding, deception, envy, intolerance, passion, bewilderment, hunger and sleep. All of these are enemies. Sometimes one&rsquo;s conceptions are also polluted by goodness.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The actual aim of life is to go back home, back to Godhead, but there are many hindrances created by the three modes of material nature&mdash;sometimes by a combination of <span class="Italic">rajo-gu&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">tamo-gu&#7751;a,</span> the modes of passion and ignorance, and sometimes by the mode of goodness. In the material world, even if one is a philanthropist, a nationalist and a good man according to materialistic estimations, these conceptions of life form a hindrance to spiritual advancement. How much more of a hindrance, then, are hostility, greed, illusion, lamentation and too much attachment to material enjoyment? To progress toward the target of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, which is our real self-interest, one must become very powerful in conquering these various hindrances or enemies. In other words, one should not be attached to being a good man or a bad man in this material world.</div>
<div class="Purport">In this material world, so-called goodness and badness are the same because they consist of the three modes of material nature. One must transcend this material nature. Even the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies consist of the three modes of material nature. Therefore K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a advised Arjuna:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">traigu&#7751;ya-vi&#7779;ay&#257; ved&#257;<br>nistraigu&#7751;yo bhav&#257;rjuna<br>nirdvandvo nitya-sattva-stho<br>niryoga-k&#7779;ema &#257;tmav&#257;n</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> mainly deal with the subject of the three modes of material nature. Rise above these modes, O Arjuna. Be transcendental to all of them. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the self.&rdquo; (Bg. <a href="indexa679.html?g=785">2.45</a>) Elsewhere in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the Lord says, <span class="Italic">&#363;rdhva&#7745; gacchanti sattva-sth&#257;&#7717;:</span> if one becomes a very good person&mdash;in other words, if one is in the mode of goodness&mdash;he may be elevated to the higher planetary systems. Similarly, if one is infected by <span class="Italic">rajo-gu&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">tamo-gu&#7751;a,</span> he may remain in this world or go down to the animal kingdom. But all of these situations are hindrances on the path of spiritual salvation. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu therefore says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">brahm&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a bhramite kona bh&#257;gyav&#257;n j&#299;va<br>guru-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-pras&#257;de p&#257;ya bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja</div>

In this regard, one must be very bold so that he can conquer these enemies of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. Not caring for the good and bad of this material world, one must boldly propagate K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness.</div>

<div class="First">In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexe89d.html?g=1505">4.9</a>) the Lord says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">janma karma ca me divyam<br>eva&#7745; yo vetti tattvata&#7717;<br>tyaktv&#257; deha&#7745; punar janma<br>naiti m&#257;m eti so &rsquo;rjuna</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.&rdquo; This is the highest perfection of life, and the human body is meant for this purpose. It is said in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (11.20.17):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">n&#7771;-deham &#257;dya&#7745; sulabha&#7745; sudurlabha&#7745;<br>plava&#7745; sukalpa&#7745; guru-kar&#7751;adh&#257;ram<br>may&#257;nuk&#363;lena nabhasvaterita&#7745;<br>pum&#257;n bhav&#257;bdhi&#7745; na taret sa &#257;tma-h&#257;</div>
<div class="After-Verse">This human form of body is a most valuable boat, and the spiritual master is the captain, <span class="Italic">guru-kar&#7751;adh&#257;ram,</span> to guide the boat in plying across the ocean of nescience. The instruction of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is a favorable breeze. One must use all these facilities to cross over the ocean of nescience. Since the spiritual master is the captain, one must serve the spiritual master very sincerely so that by his mercy one will be able to get the mercy of the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="Purport">A significant word here is <span class="Italic">acyuta-bala&#7717;.</span> The spiritual master is certainly very merciful to his disciples, and consequently by satisfying him a devotee gets strength from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu therefore says, <span class="Italic">guru-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-pras&#257;de p&#257;ya bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja:</span> one must first please the spiritual master, and then one automatically pleases K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and gets the strength with which to cross the ocean of nescience. If one seriously desires to return home, back to Godhead, one must therefore become strong enough by pleasing the spiritual master, for thus one gets the weapon with which to conquer the enemy, and one also gets the grace of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Simply getting the weapon of <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na</span> is insufficient. One must sharpen the weapon by serving the spiritual master and adhering to his instructions. Then the candidate will get the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In general warfare one must take help from his chariot and horses in order to conquer his enemy, and after conquering his enemies he may give up the chariot and its paraphernalia. Similarly, as long as one has a human body, one should fully use it to obtain the highest perfection of life, namely going back home, back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purport">The perfection of knowledge is certainly to become transcendentally situated (<span class="Italic">brahma-bh&#363;ta</span>). As the Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexc2a1.html?g=5889">18.54</a>):</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful.

In that state he attains pure devotional service.&rdquo; Simply by cultivating knowledge as the impersonalists do, one cannot get out of the clutches of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> One must attain the platform of <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span></div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">bhakty&#257; m&#257;m abhij&#257;n&#257;ti<br>y&#257;v&#257;n ya&#347; c&#257;smi tattvata&#7717;<br>tato m&#257;&#7745; tattvato j&ntilde;&#257;tv&#257;<br>vi&#347;ate tad-anantaram</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service. And when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God.&rdquo; (Bg. <a href="indexbf7d.html?g=5898">18.55</a>) Unless one has attained the stage of devotional service and the mercy of the spiritual master and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, there is a possibility that one may fall down and again accept a material body. Therefore K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a stresses in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexe89d.html?g=1505">4.9</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">janma karma ca me divyam<br>eva&#7745; yo vetti tattvata&#7717;<br>tyaktv&#257; deha&#7745; punar janma<br>naiti m&#257;m eti so &rsquo;rjuna</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">tattvata&#7717;,</span> meaning &ldquo;in reality,&rdquo; is very important. <span class="Italic">Tato m&#257;&#7745; tattvato j&ntilde;&#257;tv&#257;.</span> Unless one understands K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in truth by the mercy of the spiritual master, one is not free to give up his material body. As it is said, <span class="Italic">&#257;ruhya k&#7771;cchre&#7751;a para&#7745; pada&#7745; tata&#7717; patanty adho &rsquo;n&#257;d&#7771;ta-yu&#7779;mad-a&#7749;ghraya&#7717;:</I> [SB </span></I><a href="indexb411.html?g=76083">10.2.32</a>] if one neglects to serve the lotus feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, one cannot become free from the material clutches simply by knowledge. Even if one attains the stage of <span class="Italic">brahma-padam,</span> merging in Brahman, without <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> he is prone to fall down. One must be very careful in regard to the danger of falling down again into material bondage. The only insurance is to come to the stage of <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> from which one is sure not to fall. Then one is free from the activities of the material world. In summary, as stated by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, one must get in touch with a bona fide spiritual master coming in the <span class="Italic">parampar&#257;</span> of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, for by his mercy and instructions one is able to get strength from K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Thus one engages in devotional service and attains the ultimate goal of life, the lotus feet of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u.</div>
<div class="Purport">Significant in this verse are the words <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#257;sim acyuta-bala&#7717;.</span> <span class="Italic">J&ntilde;&#257;n&#257;sim,</span> the sword of knowledge, is given by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and when one serves the <span class="Italic">guru</span> and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in order to hold the sword of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s instructions, Balar&#257;ma gives one strength. Balar&#257;ma is Nity&#257;nanda. <span class="Italic">Vrajendra-nandana yei, &#347;ac&#299;-suta haila sei, balar&#257;ma ha-ila nit&#257;i.</span> This <span class="Italic">bala</span>&mdash;Balar&#257;ma&mdash;comes with &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, and both of Them are so merciful that in this age of Kali one may very easily take shelter of Their lotus feet.

We are therefore worshiping K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-Balar&#257;ma in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana. In the <span class="Ref_Italic">Mu&#7751;&#7693;aka Upani&#7779;ad</span> (3.2.4) it is said:</div>

<div class="After-Verse">One cannot attain the goal of life without the mercy of Balar&#257;ma. &#346;r&#299; Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura therefore says, <span class="Italic">nit&#257;iyera karu&#7751;&#257; habe, vraje r&#257;dh&#257;-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a p&#257;be:</span> when one receives the mercy of Balar&#257;ma, Nity&#257;nanda, one can attain the lotus feet of R&#257;dh&#257; and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a very easily.</div>

O&#7745;k&#257;ra should be offered into the point bindu, bindu into the vibration of sound, and that vibration into the life air. Then the living entity, who is all that remains, should be placed in Brahman, the Supreme. This is the process of sacrifice.</div>

<div class="Translation">Although one may consider the reflection of the sun from a mirror to be false, it has its factual existence. Accordingly, to prove by speculative knowledge that there is no reality would be extremely difficult.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The impersonalists try to prove that the varieties in the vision of the empiric philosopher are false. The impersonalist philosophy, <span class="Italic">vivarta-v&#257;da,</span> generally cites the acceptance of a rope to be a snake as an example of this fact. According to this example, the varieties within our vision are false, just as a rope seen to be a snake is false. The Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas say, however, that although the idea that the rope is a snake is false, the snake is not false; one has experience of a snake in reality, and therefore he knows that although the representation of the rope as a snake is false or illusory, there is a snake in reality. Similarly, this world, which is full of varieties, is not false; it is a reflection of the reality in the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha world, the spiritual world.</div>
<div class="Purport">The reflection of the sun from a mirror is nothing but light within darkness. Thus although it is not exactly sunlight, without the sunlight the reflection would be impossible. Similarly, the varieties of this world would be impossible unless there were a real prototype in the spiritual world. The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosopher cannot understand this, but a real philosopher must be convinced that light is not possible at all without a background of sunlight. Thus the jugglery of words used by the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosopher to prove that this material world is false may amaze inexperienced children, but a man with full knowledge knows perfectly well that there cannot be any existence without K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Therefore a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava insists on the platform of somehow or other accepting K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (<span class="Italic">tasm&#257;t ken&#257;py up&#257;yena mana&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;e nive&#347;ayet</span>).</div>

Speculative knowledge cannot give us reality as it is, but will continue to be nefariously imperfect.

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">In this world there are five elements&mdash;namely earth, water, fire, air and ether&mdash;but the body is not a reflection of them, nor a combination or transformation of them. Because the body and its ingredients are neither distinct nor amalgamated, all such theories are insubstantial.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">A forest is certainly a transformation of the earth, but one tree does not depend on another tree; if one is cut down, this does not mean that the others are cut down. Therefore, the forest is neither a combination nor a transformation of the trees. The best explanation is given by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">may&#257; tatam ida&#7745; sarva&#7745;<br>jagad avyakta-m&#363;rtin&#257;<br>mat-sth&#257;ni sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;ni<br>na c&#257;ha&#7745; te&#7779;v avasthita&#7717;</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them.&rdquo; (Bg. <a href="indexa3fb.html?g=3021">9.4</a>) Everything is an expansion of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s energy. As it is said, <span class="Italic">par&#257;sya &#347;aktir vividhaiva &#347;r&#363;yate:</span> the Lord has multi-energies, which are expressed in different ways. The energies are existing, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead also exists simultaneously; because everything is His energy, He is simultaneously one with everything and different from everything. Thus our speculative theories that <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;,</span> the living force, is a combination of matter, that matter is a transformation of the soul, or that the body is part of the soul are all insubstantial.</div>
<div class="Purport">Since all the Lord&rsquo;s energies are simultaneously existing, one must understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But although He is everything, He is not present in everything. The Lord must be worshiped in His original form as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. He can also present Himself in any one of His various expanded energies. When we worship the Deity of the Lord in the temple, the Deity appears to be stone or wood. Now, because the Supreme Lord does not have a material body, He is not stone or wood, yet stone and wood are not different from Him. Thus by worshiping stone or wood we get no result, but when the stone and wood are represented in the Lord&rsquo;s original form, by worshiping the Deity we get the desired result. This is supported by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu&rsquo;s philosophy, <span class="Italic">acintya-bhed&#257;bheda,</span> which explains how the Lord can present Himself everywhere and anywhere in a form of His energy to accept service from the devotee.</div>

<div class="Translation">When a substance and its parts are separated, the acceptance of similarity between one and the other is called illusion. While dreaming, one creates a separation between the existences called wakefulness and sleep. It is in such a state of mind that the regulative principles of the scriptures, consisting of injunctions and prohibitions, are recommended.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In material existence there are many regulative principles and formalities. If material existence is temporary or false, this does not mean that the spiritual world, although similar, is also false. That one&rsquo;s material body is false or temporary does not mean that the body of the Supreme Lord is also false or temporary. The spiritual world is real, and the material world is similar to it. For example, in the desert we sometimes find a mirage, but although the water in a mirage is false, this does not mean that there is no water in reality; water exists, but not in the desert. Similarly, nothing real is in this material world, but reality is in the spiritual world.

<div class="Translation">N&#257;rada Muni continued: Being invited to that festival, I also joined, and, surrounded by women, I began musically singing the glories of the demigods. Because of this, the praj&#257;patis, the great demigods in charge of the affairs of the universe, forcefully cursed me with these words: &ldquo;Because you have committed an offense, may you immediately become a &#347;&#363;dra, devoid of beauty.&rdquo;</div>

Unfortunately, there are foolish persons who invent some process of <span class="Italic">k&#299;rtana</span> on the basis of a demigod&rsquo;s name. This is an offense. <span class="Italic">K&#299;rtana</span> means glorifying the Supreme Lord, not any demigod.

But here we find that millions and millions of years ago, when N&#257;rada Muni was a Gandharva, he neglected the order to glorify the Lord, and being mad in the association of women, he began to chant otherwise. Thus he was cursed to become a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra.</span> His first offense was that he went to join the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> party in the company of lusty women, and another offense was that he considered ordinary songs, like cinema songs and other such songs, to be equal to <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana.</span> For this offense he was punished with becoming a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra.</span></div>
