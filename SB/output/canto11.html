<div class="Chapnum">1. The Curse Upon the Yadu Dynasty</div>
<div class="First">This chapter gives a hint of the destruction of the Yadu dynasty, whichtook place owing to the appearance of an iron club. Hearing this narration is agreat impetus for becoming detached from the material world.Lord Çré Kåñëa expertly arranged the great Kurukñetra battle between theKurus and the Päëòavas and thus removed to a great extent the earth's burden.But the Supreme Lord, whose influence is inconceivable, was not yet satisfied,because of the continued presence of the undefeatable Yadu family. The Lorddesired to bring about the destruction of the Yadu dynasty so that He couldcompletely wind up His pastimes on the earth and go back to His own abode.Using the pretense of a curse by an assembly of brähmaëas, He withdrew His entire dynasty from the surface of the earth.</div>
<div class="First">By Çré Kåñëa's desire, many great sages, headed by Närada and Viçvämitra,assembled at the holy place named Piëòäraka, near the city of Dvärakä. Theyoung boys of the Yadu family, absorbed in a playful mood, also arrived there.These boys dressed Sämba in the guise of a pregnant woman about to givebirth and inquired from the sages about the fruitfulness of Sämba's so-calledpregnancy. The sages cursed the mocking boys by saying, "She will give birth toa club that will destroy your family." The Yadus, frightened by this curse,immediately lifted the garment from Sämba's abdomen and found a club.Hurrying to the assembly of Ugrasena, the King of the Yadus, they offered areport of everything that had taken place. Fearing the brähmaëas' curse,Yaduräja Ugrasena ordered the club ground to powder and thrown into theocean. Within the ocean, a fish swallowed the last remaining lump of iron, andthe waves carried all the bits of ground powder to the shore, where they wereimplanted and eventually grew into a grove of canes. Fishermen caught thefish, and a hunter named Jarä used the iron lump found in its belly to fashionan arrow. Although the Supersoul, Lord Çré Kåñëa, understood what washappening, He did not wish to do anything to counteract it. Rather, in the form of time He sanctioned these events.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé said: Lord Çré Kåñëa, accompanied by Balaräma and surrounded by the Yadu dynasty, executed the killing of many demons. Then, further to remove the burden of the earth, the Lord arranged for the great Battle of Kurukñetra, which suddenly erupted in violence between the Kurus and the Päëòavas.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Eleventh Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam begins with a reference to thepastimes executed by Lord Çré Kåñëa in the Tenth Canto. The beginning ofthe Tenth Canto describes that when the earth was overburdened bydemoniac rulers, the personified earth, Bhümi, approached Lord Brahmä withtears in her eyes, begging for relief, and Brahmä immediately went with thedemigods to approach the Supreme Lord in His form of Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu.As the demigods waited respectfully on the shore of the milk ocean, theSupreme Lord announced through Brahmä that He would soon incarnate onearth and that the demigods should also descend to assist in His pastimes. Thusfrom the very beginning of Lord Kåñëa's appearance it was understood that He would descend to the earth to remove the demons.</div>
<div class="First">As Çréla Prabhupäda states in his commentary to Bhagavad-gétä (16.6), thosewho agree to obey the injunctions of revealed scriptures are known asdemigods, whereas those who defy the orders of Vedic scriptures are known asasuras, or demons. The Vedic literatures are presented within the universe forthe guidance of the conditioned souls, who are trapped under the three modesof material nature and who are therefore rotating in a continuous cycle ofbirth and death. By strictly adhering to the Vedic injunctions, we can easilysatisfy our material needs and at the same time make tangible progress on thepath back home, back to Godhead. Thus we can achieve an eternal life of blissand knowledge in the Lord's own abode simply by obeying the Lord'sinstructions as they are presented in Vedic literatures such as Bhagavad-gétäand Çrémad-Bhägavatam. The demons, however, minimize or even mock theabsolute authority of the Supreme Lord and His teachings. Because theseasuras envy the sovereign status of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, theyminimize the importance of the Vedic scriptures, which emanate directly fromthe breathing of the Lord. The demons establish a society governed by theirown concocted whims and inevitably create chaos and misery, especially forpious living entities who sincerely desire to follow the will of God.Lord Çré Kåñëa states in Bhagavad-gétä that when there is a predominanceof such chaotic, irreligious societies on the earth, He personally descends torectify the imbalance. Thus from the very beginning of His transcendentalinfancy, Kåñëa systematically killed the powerful asuras, or demons, who werean intolerable burden for the earth. Lord Çré Kåñëa was assisted by His brother,Balaräma, who is also the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although God isone, He can expand Himself to enjoy in many forms at once. That is Hisomnipotence. And the first such expansion is Balaräma, or Baladeva. Balarämakilled many noteworthy demons, including Dhenukäsura, Dvivida and theenvious Rukmé. Kåñëa was also accompanied by the members of the Yadudynasty, many of whom were demigods who had descended to assist the Lord.Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, however, has revealed thatalthough many demigods had taken birth in the Yadu dynasty to assist theLord, some members of the Yadu dynasty were actually inimical toward Kåñëa.Because of their mundane vision of the Lord, they considered themselves to beon the same level as Kåñëa. Having taken birth in the family of the SupremePersonality of Godhead Himself, they had inconceivable strength, and thusthey misunderstood Kåñëa's supreme position. Having forgotten that Kåñëa isthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, they would constitute a great burden,and consequently it was necessary for Kåñëa to remove them from the earth.There is a popular saying that familiarity breeds contempt. To destroy thecontemptuous members of His own dynasty, the Lord caused a quarrel amongthem. For this purpose, He arranged for Närada and other sages to displayanger against the Kärñëas, the members of His family. Although many Yaduswho were devoted to Kåñëa were apparently killed in this fratricidal war, LordKåñëa actually returned them to their original positions as universal directors,or demigods. It is the Lord's promise in Bhagavad-gétä that He will always protect those who are favorable to His service.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, in his commentary on this verse, hasgiven a summary of the entire Eleventh Canto as follows. Chapter Onedescribes the beginning of the mauñala-lélä, or the prelude to the destruction ofthe Yadu dynasty. Chapters Two through Five describe the conversationsbetween the nine Yogendras and King Nimi. Chapter Six describes the prayersof Brahmä, Çiva and other residents of heaven. Chapters Seven throughTwenty-nine present the conversation between Kåñëa and Uddhava that isknown as the Uddhava-gétä. Chapter Thirty describes the withdrawal of theYadu dynasty from the earth. The final chapter describes the disappearance of Lord Kåñëa.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Because the sons of Päëòu were enraged by the numerous offenses of their enemies, such as duplicitous gambling, verbal insults, the seizing of Draupadé's hair, and many other cruel transgressions, the Supreme Lord engaged those Päëòavas as the immediate cause to execute His will. On the pretext of the Battle of Kurukñetra, Lord Kåñëa arranged for all the kings who were burdening the earth to assemble with their armies on opposite sides of the battlefield, and when the Lord killed them through the agency of war, the earth was relieved of its burden.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Päëòavas were repeatedly harassed by their enemies, such asDuryodhana and Duùçäsana. As innocent young princes, the Päëòavas had noenemy, but Duryodhana was constantly plotting against his helpless cousins.The Päëòavas were sent to a house of lac, which was later burned to theground. They were administered poison, and their chaste wife Draupadé waspublicly insulted when her hair was pulled and an attempt was made to stripher naked. Throughout these dangers, Lord Çré Kåñëa constantly protected thePäëòavas, who were fully surrendered to Him and who knew no shelter other than Him.</div>
<div class="First">In this verse the word itaretarataù is significant. Previous to the Battle ofKurukñetra, Kåñëa had personally killed many demons, including Pütanä, Keçé,Aghäsura and Kaàsa. Now, Kåñëa wanted to complete His mission ofremoving the earth's burden by killing the remaining impious persons. But asstated here, kåtvä nimittam: the Lord did not personally kill, but empoweredHis devotees Arjuna and the other Päëòavas to remove the impious kings.Thus acting personally and through His immediate expansion Balaräma, aswell as by empowering His pure devotees such as the Päëòavas, Kåñëa fullydisplayed the pastimes of the yugävatära by reestablishing religious principlesand ridding the world of demons. Although the general purpose of theKurukñetra battle was to kill the demons, by Kåñëa's arrangement some greatdevotees such as Bhéñma also appeared to be inimical toward the Lord. But asdescribed in the First Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.9.39) by the words hatägatäù svarüpam, many great devotees played with the Lord as enemies andupon being killed by Kåñëa returned immediately to His abode in the spiritualsky in their original spiritual bodies. Because God is absolute, by His killing Hesimultaneously removes the demons from the earth and encourages His pure devotees.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> The Supreme Personality of Godhead used the Yadu dynasty, which was protected by His own arms, to eliminate the kings who with their armies had been the burden of this earth. Then the unfathomable Lord thought to Himself, "Although some may say that the earth's burden is now gone, in My opinion it is not yet gone, because there still remains the Yädava dynasty itself, whose strength is unbearable for the earth."</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has remarked in this regard thatalthough ordinary people might think that the Lord had now removed theburden of the earth by killing the demons, reestablishing dharma, and so on,Lord Çré Kåñëa Himself could detect that there was further danger from theirreligious activities of His own family members who were acting improperly. Itis stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam that a just king will refuse to punish his ownenemy if his enemy is innocent but will punish his own son if his son actuallydeserves punishment. Thus although in the eyes of the world the members ofthe Lord's own dynasty are always worshipable, Lord Kåñëa detected that bytheir intimate association with Him some members of the Yadu dynasty hadbecome indifferent to His will. Since such whimsical members of the Yadudynasty could act freely, being relatives of the Supreme Personality ofGodhead, they would surely cause great misfortune for the world, and foolishpersons would take such whimsical behavior to be the will of Kåñëa. Thus theLord, whose desires are inconceivable, began to consider the need toannihilate the indifferent, contemptuous members of the Yadu family.From the viewpoint of ordinary persons, all the demons had been killed bythe Supreme Lord's pastimes in Dvärakä and Mathurä, as well as by the Battleof Kurukñetra, and the earth was now free of its burden. Nevertheless, to freethe earth from the remaining burden of His own puffed-up family members,Lord Çré Kåñëa transferred them away from the earth by causing a fratricidalquarrel among them. In this way He prepared for His own disappearance from the earth.</div>
<div class="First">Çrédhara Svämé has pointed out that the word bähubhiù, "by His arms," isused in the plural (rather than the dual) to indicate that the Lord caused thedestruction of the Yadu dynasty in His four-armed form. The original form ofKåñëa as Govinda is two-armed, but it was by the plenary portion of thefour-armed Näräyaëa that the Lord killed all the demons on the earth andultimately removed the burdensome members of His own family. It may beasked, If certain members of the Yadu family had become indifferent to thewill of the Lord, why didn't they oppose the Lord in His plan to remove themfrom the earth? Therefore the word aprameyaù is used, which indicates that itis impossible for anyone, even the Lord's own family members, to understand His will completely.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has given another reason for the destruction of the Yadudynasty. He emphasizes that the activities of the Supreme Personality ofGodhead should never be taken to be ordinary material activities. Nor are theLord's associates ordinary persons. Although Lord Kåñëa apparently incarnateswithin this world for some time and then goes away, it should be understoodthat the Supreme Lord is eternally situated with His entourage in His variousabodes in the spiritual sky, such as Çré Gokula, Mathurä and Dvärakä. Themembers of the Yadu dynasty are eternal associates of the Lord, and thereforethey cannot bear to be separated from the Lord. Since Kåñëa was preparing togive up His earthly pastimes, if He were to leave the Yadu dynasty on the earththey would surely become so disturbed by His absence that in their highlyagitated state of mind they would trample and destroy the earth. Therefore,Kåñëa arranged the disappearance of the Yadu dynasty prior to His own disappearance.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Jéva Gosvämé concludes that ultimately the members of the Yadudynasty are never to be considered irreligious. Vaiñëava äcäryas havementioned that the story of the disappearance of the Yadu dynasty is especiallymeant to help the conditioned souls achieve liberation from the bondage ofmaterialistic life. Within the three worlds there were none as powerful andopulent as the Yadu dynasty. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is thepossessor of unlimited opulences—beauty, strength, knowledge, fame and soon—and the members of the Yadu dynasty, being the personal associates ofthe Lord, were also endowed with inconceivable opulences. Therefore, whenwe see how a fratricidal war suddenly deprived the members of the Yadudynasty of all of their earthly possessions and even their lives, we canunderstand that there is no permanent position within this material world. Inother words, although the members of the Yadu dynasty are eternal associatesof the Lord and were immediately transferred to another planet where theLord was appearing, their sudden disappearance through fratricidal war ismeant to impress upon the conditioned souls the temporary nature of thisworld. Therefore, the apparent indifference or enmity of certain members ofthe Yadu dynasty toward Kåñëa should not be taken to be actual irreligion ontheir part. The entire situation was arranged by Lord Kåñëa to teach a lesson tothe conditioned souls. In this connection Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has cited severalverses from the Bhägavatam to prove that the members of the Yadu dynastyachieved their exalted birth in the Lord's own family by innumerable piousactivities and by complete absorption in thought of Lord Kåñëa. In fact it issaid that in sleeping, sitting, walking and speaking, they were unable toremember their own selves, because they were simply thinking of Kåñëa.In the First Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.15.33), Çréla Prabhupäda hascommented as follows on the disappearance of the Yadu dynasty: "The settingof the sun does not mean the end of the sun. It means that the sun is out of oursight. Similarly, the end of the mission of the Lord on a particular planet oruniverse only means that He is out of our sight. The end of the Yadu dynastyalso does not mean that it is annihilated. It disappears along with the Lord, out of our sight."</div>

<div class="Translation"> Lord Kåñëa thought, "No outside force could ever bring about the defeat of this family, the Yadu dynasty, whose members have always been fully surrendered to Me and are unrestricted in their opulence. But if I inspire a quarrel within the dynasty, that quarrel will act just like a fire created from the friction of bamboo in a grove, and then I shall achieve My real purpose and return to My eternal abode."</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Even though Lord Kåñëa wanted to arrange for the disappearance of themembers of the Yadu dynasty, He could not personally kill them, as He hadkilled many demons, because the Yadu dynasty was His own family. One mightask why Lord Kåñëa did not arrange for them to be killed by others. Thereforeit is stated in this verse, naivänyataù paribhavo 'sya bhavet kathaïcit: becausethe Yadu dynasty was the Lord's own family, no one within the universe wascapable of killing them, not even the demigods. In fact, Viçvanätha CakravartéÖhäkura points out that no one within the universe was capable of eveninsulting the members of the Yadu dynasty, what to speak of defeating orkilling them. The reason is given here by the words mat-saàçrayasya. Themembers of the Yadu dynasty had fully taken shelter of Kåñëa, and thereforethey were always under the personal protection of the Lord. It is stated, märekåñëa räkhe ke, räkhe kåñëa märe ke: If Kåñëa protects someone, no one can killhim, and if Kåñëa wants to kill someone, no one can save him. Kåñëa hadoriginally requested all of His associates, along with the demigods, to appear onthe earth to assist Him in His pastimes. Now that His pastimes were coming toan end on this particular planet and would be transferred to another planet inanother universe, Kåñëa wanted to remove all of His associates from the earthso that in His absence they would not constitute a burden. Since the powerfulYadu dynasty, being the Lord's personal family and army, could not possibly bedefeated by anyone, Kåñëa arranged an internal quarrel, just as the wind in abamboo forest sometimes rubs the bamboos together and creates a fire that consumes the entire forest.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté has pointed out that ordinary people,hearing of the adventures of the Yadu family, might think that the heroes ofthe Yadu dynasty are as worshipable as Kåñëa or that they are independentcontrollers. In other words, people polluted by Mäyäväda philosophy might seethe Yadu dynasty as being on the same level as Kåñëa. Therefore, to establishthat even the most powerful living entity can never equal or surpass theSupreme Lord, Kåñëa arranged for the destruction of the Yadu dynasty.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has made a very importantcomment on this verse. He states that since the intentions of the SupremeLord, Kåñëacandra, are always perfect, it was certainly in consideration of thegreatest benefit for the entire world that He destroyed His own family on thepretext of a curse by brähmaëas. In this connection, Bhaktisiddhänta SarasvatéÖhäkura has shown a parallel in the pastimes of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, who is Kåñëa Himself appearing as His own devotee.</div>
<div class="First">Lord Caitanya appeared along with His first plenary expansion, known asLord Nityänanda Prabhu, and with Lord Advaita Prabhu. All threepersonalities—Caitanya Mahäprabhu, Nityänanda Prabhu and AdvaitaPrabhu—are accepted by Vaiñëava äcäryas to be in the category ofviñëu-tattva, the full status of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thesethree Personalities of Godhead perceived that in the future Their so-calledseminal descendants would get undue recognition and thus, being puffed up,would commit grave offenses against those who were actually Vaiñëava gurus or representatives of the Lord.</div>
<div class="First">Every living being is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, as stated in theBhagavad-gétä (mamaiväàçaù). Every living entity is originally a son of God,yet to execute His pastimes the Lord selects certain highly qualified livingentities whom He allows to take birth as His personal relatives. But thoseliving entities who appear as descendants of the Lord's personal family mayundoubtedly become proud of such a position and thus abuse the greatadulation they receive from ordinary people. In this way such persons mayartificially get undue attention and divert people from the actual principle ofspiritual advancement, which is to surrender to the pure devotee whorepresents the Lord. The last eight verses (85)of the Twelfth Chapter ofBhagavad-gétä give a description of the pure devotees the Lord permits to act asäcäryas, or spiritual leaders of mankind. In other words, simply to take birth inthe personal family of Kåñëa is not the qualification for being a spiritualmaster, since according to Bhagavad-gétä, pitäham asya jagataù: every livingentity is eternally a member of the Lord's family. Kåñëa says in Bhagavad-gétä,samo 'haà sarva-bhüteñu na me dveñyo 'sti na priyaù: [Bg. 9.29] "I am equal toeveryone. No one is My enemy, and no one is My special friend." If theSupreme Personality of Godhead appears to have a special family, such as theYadu dynasty, such a so-called family is a special arrangement of the Lord'spastimes in order to attract the conditioned souls. When Kåñëa descends, Heacts as if He were an ordinary person in order to attract the living entities toHis pastimes. Therefore Kåñëa acted as though the Yadu dynasty was Hispersonal family, although in fact every living entity is a member of His family.Ordinary people, however, not understanding the higher principles ofspiritual knowledge, easily forget the actual qualifications of a bona fidespiritual master and instead give undue importance to people born in theLord's so-called family. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, therefore, avoided thisimpediment on the path of spiritual enlightenment by leaving behind nochildren. Although Caitanya Mahäprabhu married twice, He was childless.Nityänanda Prabhu, who is also the Supreme Personality of Godhead, did notaccept any of the natural sons born of His own son, Çré Vérabhadra. Similarly,Lord Advaita Äcärya divested of His association all of His sons exceptAcyutänanda and two others. Acyutänanda, the chief faithful son of AdvaitaÄcärya, had no seminal progeny, and the remaining three of the six sons ofLord Advaita fell from the path of devotion to the Lord and are known asrejected sons. In other words, the appearance of Caitanya Mahäprabhuallowed little facility for continuing a so-called seminal family to createconfusion. The respect shown to the conception of seminal lineage indeference to the ideas of the smärtas is unfit to be accepted by one whoactually understands the supreme truth from Vedic authority.Other äcäryas, or spiritual masters, have also demonstrated this point intheir own families. His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda,our own beloved spiritual master, who is the mighty author of thisÇrémad-Bhägavatam series, was born in a family of pure devotees, and hehimself exhibited all the symptoms of pure devotional service from his verychildhood. Çréla Prabhupäda eventually came to the Western countries andexhibited unprecedented spiritual potency in establishing the Kåñëaconsciousness movement all over the world. In a few short years, he translatedmore than fifty large volumes of Vedic philosophy. By his practical activitieshe is certainly understood to be a most empowered representative of the Lord.Nonetheless, his own family members, although devotees of Kåñëa, did not atall come up to the proper standard of devotional service and are therefore notgiven attention by the members of ISKCON. The natural tendency for themembers of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness would be tooffer all reverence and worship to the members of Çréla Prabhupäda'simmediate family. But since by Kåñëa's arrangement these family members arenot at all on the platform of pure devotional service, the members of ISKCONgive them hardly any attention but instead worship those who actually exhibitthe qualities of highly advanced Vaiñëavas, regardless of their so-called birth.In other words, birth cannot constitute the qualification for a respectableperson, even when one is born in the Lord's own family or in the äcärya'sfamily, what to speak of an ordinary wealthy or learned family.In India there is a class of men known as nityänanda-vaàça, who claim to bedirect descendants of Lord Nityänanda and therefore worthy of the highestrespect for their position in devotional service. In this regard, ÇrélaPrabhupäda has written in The Nectar of Devotion, "In the Middle Ages, afterthe disappearance of Lord Caitanya's great associate Lord Nityänanda, a classof priestly persons claimed to be the descendants of Nityänanda, callingthemselves the gosvämé caste. They further claimed that the practice andspreading of devotional service belonged only to their particular class, whichwas known as nityänanda-vaàça. In this way they exercised their artificialpower for some time, until Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, thepowerful äcärya of the Gauòéya Vaiñëava sampradäya, completely smashedtheir idea. There was a great hard struggle for some time, but it has turned outsuccessful, and it is now correctly and practically established that devotionalservice is not restricted to a particular class of men. Besides that, anyone whois engaged in devotional service is already a high-class brähmaëa. So ÇrélaBhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura's struggle for this movement has come outsuccessful. It is on the basis of his position that anyone, from any part of the universe, can become a Gauòéya Vaiñëava."</div>
<div class="First">In other words, the essence of spiritual knowledge is that every living being,regardless of his present status in life, is originally a servant of the SupremeLord, and it is the mission of the Lord to reclaim all of these fallen livingentities. Despite his past situation, any living being who is willing to surrenderagain at the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord or His bona fide representative canpurify himself by strictly adhering to the rules and regulations of bhakti-yogaand thus act as a high-class brähmaëa. Nonetheless, the seminal descendants ofthe Lord think themselves to have acquired their ancestor's character andposition. Thus the Supreme Lord, who is the well-wisher of the entire universeand especially of His devotees, bewilders the discriminatory power of His owndescendants in such a contradictory way that these seminal descendantsbecome recognized as deviant and the actual qualification to be arepresentative of the Lord, namely unalloyed surrender to the will of Kåñëa, remains prominent.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is the reservoir of all beauty. All beautiful things emanate from Him, and His personal form is so attractive that it steals the eyes away from all other objects, which then seem devoid of beauty in comparison to Him. When Lord Kåñëa was on the earth, He attracted the eyes of all people. When Kåñëa spoke, His words attracted the minds of all who remembered them. By seeing the footsteps of Lord Kåñëa, people became attracted to Him, and thus they wanted to offer their bodily activities to the Lord as His followers. In this way Kåñëa very easily spread His glories, which are sung throughout the world by the most sublime and essential Vedic verses. Lord Kåñëa considered that simply by hearing and chanting those glories, conditioned souls born in the future would cross beyond the darkness of ignorance. Being satisfied with this arrangement, He left for His desired destination.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to Çrédhara Svämé, these two verses indicate that Lord Kåñëa,having achieved all the purposes for which He had descended, went back toHis spiritual kingdom. It is natural that people in the material world hanker tosee a beautiful object. In materialistic life, however, our consciousness ispolluted by the influence of the three modes of nature, and therefore wehanker for material objects of beauty and pleasure. The materialistic process ofsense gratification is imperfect, because the laws of material nature will notallow us to be happy or satisfied in materialistic life. The living entity isconstitutionally an eternal servant of God and is meant to appreciate theinfinite beauty and pleasure of the Supreme Lord. Lord Kåñëa is the AbsoluteTruth and the reservoir of all beauty and pleasure. By serving Kåñëa we canalso share in His ocean of beauty and pleasure, and thus our desire to seebeautiful things and enjoy life will be fully satisfied. The example is given thatthe hand cannot enjoy food independently but can assimilate it indirectly bygiving it to the stomach. Similarly, by serving Lord Kåñëa the living entity,who is part and parcel of the Lord, will derive unlimited happiness.The inconceivable Supreme Lord, Çré Kåñëa, by displaying His own trueform, freed the living entities from falsely seeking forms of beauty other thanHis form, which is itself the source of all beautiful things. Simply by seeing Hislotus feet, fortunate living beings could distinguish between the ungodlyendeavors of the karmés, who seek gross enjoyment for their own sensegratification, and the practice of dovetailing one's activities with the service ofthe Lord. Although philosophers perpetually speculate about the nature ofGod, Lord Kåñëa directly liberated the jéva souls from all speculativemisunderstandings about Him by displaying His actual transcendental formand activities. Superficially, Kåñëa's personal form, words and activitiesresemble those of ordinary conditioned souls. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta SarasvatéÖhäkura explains that this apparent resemblance between the Lord's activitiesand those of the living entities is a merciful concession by the Lord so that theconditioned souls will be attracted to Him and become eligible to return to Hiskingdom for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge. By showing His ownspiritual form and kingdom to the living entities in a way tangible for them,Lord Kåñëa drove away their false enjoying attitude and removed theirlong-standing indifference to His personality. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, ifone can understand the position of Çré Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality ofGodhead, one will never again fall into the network of material illusion. Sucha falldown can be avoided if one constantly hears about the uniquetranscendental form and beauty of the Lord from authorized Vedic literatures. As explained in Bhagavad-gétä (2.42-43):</div>

<div class="First">"Men of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of theVedas, which recommend various fruitive activities for elevation to heavenlyplanets, resultant good birth, power, and so forth. Being desirous of sensegratification and opulent life, they say that there is nothing more than this."On the other hand, certain parts of Vedic literature are specifically meantto award material sense gratification to the conditioned soul and at the sametime gradually condition him to obey the Vedic injunctions. The portions ofthe Vedas that recommend fruitive activities for regulated sense gratificationare themselves dangerous, because the living being who engages in suchactivities becomes easily entangled in the material enjoyment offered andneglects the ultimate purpose of the Vedas. The ultimate purpose of Vedicliterature is to bring the living entity back to his original consciousness, inwhich he acts as an eternal servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Byrendering service to the Lord, the living entity can enjoy unlimited spiritualbliss in the association of the Lord in His own kingdom. Thus, one whoseriously desires to advance in Kåñëa consciousness should specifically hear theVedic literature that deals with pure devotional service to the Lord. Oneshould hear from those who are highly advanced in Kåñëa consciousness andavoid interpretations that stimulate materialistic desires for enjoyment.When the tiny living entity is finally able to see the difference between thetemporary affairs of this world and the transcendental activities of LordTrivikrama, Kåñëa, he devotes himself to the Lord and removes from his heartthe dark covering of matter, no longer desiring sense gratification, which isenjoyed under the two headings sin and piety. In other words, although peoplewithin this world are considered sinful or pious, on the material platform bothsin and piety are performed for one's personal gratification. If one canunderstand that his real happiness lies in giving pleasure to Kåñëa, Lord Kåñëatakes such a fortunate living being back to His own abode, which is calledGoloka Våndävana. According to Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, theLord first gives a sincere soul the opportunity to hear about His pastimes.When the devotee has advanced in his spontaneous attraction to suchnarrations, the Lord gives him the opportunity to take part in His spiritualpastimes as they appear within this world. By taking part in the pastimes of theLord within a particular universe, the living being becomes completelydetached from the material world, and ultimately the Lord brings him to His personal abode in the spiritual sky.</div>
<div class="First">Foolish people cannot understand this substantial benefit offered by theLord, but Lord Kåñëa acts for the benefit of such foolish people by saving themfrom their absorption in the temporary world of false enjoyment. The Lorddoes this by personally displaying His own superlative transcendental beauty,transcendental words and transcendental activities. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé haspointed out that the words tamo 'nayä tariñyanti indicate that although LordKåñëa appeared five thousand years ago, one who hears and chants about theactivities, form and words of the Lord will get exactly the same benefit as thosewho personally experienced these things as contemporaries of Lord Kåñëa. Inother words, he will also cross over the darkness of material existence andachieve the Lord's abode. Thus Çréla Jéva Gosvämé concludes that if such anexalted destination is available to all living beings, it must certainly have beenawarded to the Yädavas, who were personal associates of the Lord.It is stated in this verse that by His beauty Kåñëa stole away the vision ofpeople who saw Him. Kåñëa's speaking was so attractive that those who heardHim became speechless. Since generally those who cannot speak are also deaf,the Lord's words also stole away the ears of those who heard Him, since theywere no longer interested in hearing sounds other than the Lord's speaking. Bydisplaying the beauty of His footsteps, Kåñëa stole away from those who sawthem the power to perform materialistic activities. Thus by His appearance inthis world Kåñëa took away the senses of mankind. In other words, He madepeople blind, dumb, deaf, mad and otherwise invalid. Therefore ViçvanäthaCakravarté Öhäkura asks, "Since He took away everything people possessed,who would properly call Him merciful? Rather, He is just a thief." In this way,he indirectly offers the highest praise to the beauty of the Lord. ViçvanäthaCakravarté Öhäkura also points out that although Kåñëa gave liberation to thedemons by destroying them, to those who were attracted to Him, Kåñëa gavepure love of God and drowned them in the ocean of His own beauty. ThusKåñëa is not like a person who gives charity without discrimination. AndKåñëa is so merciful that not only did He give the highest benediction to theinhabitants of the earth, but He empowered great saintly persons such asVyäsadeva to describe His pastimes with beautiful poetic verses. Thus peopleborn on the earth in the future could easily cross over the ocean of birth anddeath by those glories, which are compared to a strong boat. In fact, those of uswho are now enjoying the glories of Kåñëa through the transparent medium ofthe Bhaktivedanta purports to Çrémad-Bhägavatam, by the mercy of His DivineGrace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda, are the fortunate recipients ofthe mercy of Kåñëa, who was merciful even to persons yet to be born.Quoting from the Amara-koça dictionary, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté hasalso stated, padaà vyavasita-träëa-sthäna-lakñmy-aìghri-vastuñu: the possibledefinitions for padam are "that which has been decided," "place of deliverance,""fortune," "foot" or "object." Thus he translates the word padam as also meaningvyavasita, "that which has been decided." In other words, the statement agätsvam padam éçvaraù indicates not only that Kåñëa went to His abode, but thatKåñëa realized His determined desire. If we say that Kåñëa returned to Hiseternal abode, we imply that Kåñëa had been absent from His abode and wasnow returning. Therefore, Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura points out that it isincorrect to say in a normal sense that Kåñëa "went back to His abode."According to the Brahma-saàhitä, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,Kåñëa, is always present in His eternal abode in the spiritual sky. Yet by Hiscauseless mercy He also manifests Himself from time to time within thematerial world. In other words, God is all-pervading. Even when presentbefore us He is simultaneously in His abode. The ordinary soul, or jéva, is notall-pervading like the Supersoul, and therefore by his presence in the materialworld he is absent from the spiritual world. In fact, we are suffering due to thatabsence from the spiritual world, or Vaikuëöha. The Supreme Personality ofGodhead, however, is all-pervading, and therefore Viçvanätha CakravartéÖhäkura translates the words agät svaà padam to mean that Kåñëa achievedexactly what He desired. The Lord is all-pervading and self-sufficient infulfilling His perfect desires. His appearance and disappearance in this worldshould never be compared to ordinary material activities.Viçvanätha Cakravarté has quoted a statement by Uddhava at thebeginning of the Third Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (3.2.7) wherein Uddhavacompares the disappearance of Lord Kåñëa to the setting of the sun. In hispurport to this verse, Çréla Prabhupäda has written, "The comparison of Kåñëato the sun is very appropriate. As soon as the sun sets, darkness automaticallyappears. But the darkness experienced by the common man does not affect thesun itself either at the time of sunrise or at sunset. Lord Kåñëa's appearanceand disappearance are exactly like that of the sun. He appears and disappearsin innumerable universes, and as long as He is present in a particular universethere is all transcendental light in that universe, but the universe from whichHe passes away is put into darkness. His pastimes, however, are everlasting.The Lord is always present in some universe, just as the sun is present in eitherthe eastern or western hemisphere. The sun is always present either in India orAmerica, but when the sun is present in India the American land is indarkness, and when the sun is present in America the Indian hemisphere is in darkness."</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has quoted a verse from the end of the Eleventh Cantothat further clarifies that the abode of the Lord is as eternal as the LordHimself: "The ocean immediately swallowed Dvärakä, O Mahäräja, takingaway the Lord's personal abode, which the Lord had abandoned. The SupremeLord, Madhusüdana, is always present in Dvärakä, which merely by beingremembered takes away everything unfavorable. It is the most auspicious ofauspicious places." (SB 11.31.23-24) Just as the sun appears to be swallowed bythe night, Kåñëa or His abode or His dynasty seems to disappear, but actuallythe Lord and all of His paraphernalia, including His abode and dynasty, areeternal, in the same way as the sun is always in the sky. Çréla Prabhupäda saysin this connection, "As the sun appears in the morning and gradually rises tothe meridian and then again sets in one hemisphere while simultaneouslyrising in the other, so Lord Kåñëa's disappearance in one universe and thebeginning of His different pastimes in another take place simultaneously. Assoon as one pastime is finished here, it is manifested in another universe. Andthus His nitya-lélä, or eternal pastimes, are going on without ending."</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Brähmaëas generally become angry at persons who disrespect thebrahminical class, who are uncharitable and who decline to serve senior,respectable personalities. The Våñëis, however, were not like that, and thusthey are described here by King Parékñit as brahmaëyänäm, or sincere followersof brahminical culture. Further, even if the brähmaëas became angry, whywould they curse members of Kåñëa's own family? Since the brähmaëas werewell learned, they must have known that it is offensive to oppose personalassociates of the Supreme Lord. The Yadu dynasty is specifically described hereas våñnénäm and kåñëa-cetasäm. In other words, they were Lord Kåñëa's ownmen, and they were always absorbed in thinking of Kåñëa. Therefore, even ifsomehow or other the brähmaëas had cursed them, how could that curse have</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">had any effect?</div>
<div class="First"> These are the questions of Parékñit Mahäräja.Although the Våñëis are described in this verse as kåñëa-cetasäm, alwaysabsorbed in thinking of Kåñëa, it is clearly indicated that Kåñëa desired thatthe brähmaëas become angry and curse the Yadu dynasty. The Supreme Lorddesired to remove His personal dynasty from the earth, and thereforeuncustomary offensive behavior was exhibited by the young boys of Kåñëa's own family.</div>
<div class="First">It is to be understood from this incident that when a man displays envy andridicule of devotees of Viñëu, his brahmaëyatä, or high spiritual qualifications,along with his reverence for Çré Kåñëa, are all destroyed. Contempt andridicule directed toward respectable persons and true brähmaëas vanquish allgood qualities. If there is a break in etiquette toward His devotees, theSupreme Lord will become ill-disposed even to His own relatives and friendsand thus arrange to destroy those who oppose His devotees. If foolish personsin the guise of members of Kåñëa's personal family express enmity towardVaiñëavas, such offenders cannot properly be called offspring of Lord Kåñëa'sdynasty. That is the supreme equality of the Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This verse answers Parékñit Mahäräja's question as to how the powerfulmembers of the Yadu dynasty could be cursed by the brähmaëas and thusdestroy themselves in a fratricidal war. By the words saàhartum aicchata kulamit is clearly stated that Lord Kåñëa Himself desired to withdraw His dynastyand therefore engaged the brähmaëas as His agent. Viçvanätha CakravartéÖhäkura remarks here that Kåñëa had clearly demonstrated the insurpassablebeauty and strength of His personal form, pastimes and pleasures to all theresidents of the earth. Thus His incarnation to kill the demons, save thedevotees and reestablish religious principles had been completely successful.When Lord Kåñëa noticed that His mission was now complete, everythinghaving been done perfectly, He desired to return to His transcendental abode,along with the Våñëis. Thus the Lord personally arranged for the Yadu dynasty to be cursed by the brähmaëas.</div>
<div class="First">According to Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, äpta-kämaù means thatKåñëa is always self-satisfied, and yet in order to execute His transcendentalpastimes He arranged to destroy His own dynasty for three specific purposes,namely, to reestablish in the heavenly planets those demigods who had takenbirth among the Yadus to assist Him, to reestablish His plenary Viñëuexpansions in Their abodes, such as Vaikuëöha, Çvetadvépa andBadarikäçrama, and to remove Himself from the vision of the material world, along with His eternal associates.</div>
<div class="First">In this connection, Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté has made several importantremarks about the destruction of the Yadu dynasty. He states that manyso-called religious persons have fallen down by committing the second offenseagainst chanting the holy name, namely viñëau sarveçvareçetad-itara-sama-dhéù, considering another living entity to be equal to LordViñëu, who is the Lord of lords. One who is captured by the impersonaltendency of Mäyäväda philosophy falsely thinks that the external, materialenergy of the Lord is equal to His internal, spiritual potency. In this way, oneequates ordinary living entities with the Supreme Personality of Godhead,taking Kåñëa to be another aspect of mäyä. This is a most unfortunatemisconception, for it spoils one's opportunity to understand God as He actually is.</div>
<div class="First">Persons inclined toward this illusory conception of life would undoubtedlyconsider the members of the Yadu dynasty equal in all respects to Kåñëa andworship the future descendants of Kåñëa's family as being equal to KåñëaHimself. Thus the continued presence of the Yadu dynasty on the earth wouldcertainly constitute a great impediment on the path of spiritual understandingand a great burden on the earth. To counteract the danger to the world fromthe offense of equating Viñëu with the family of Viñëu, the Lord decided to crush the Yadu family.</div>
<div class="First">The Supreme Lord, Çré Kåñëa, is always affectionate to His devotees, butwhenever the familial descendants of Lord Kåñëa become inimical orindifferent to Him, not loving His pure devotees or making friendship withHis servants, such so-called family members of the Lord become impedimentsto His will. There is a tangible danger that ignorant living beings will worshipsuch inimical persons, revering them as close associates of Kåñëa. For example,to consider Kaàsa the maternal uncle of Kåñëa and therefore a faithfulservant of Kåñëa would be a completely erroneous conclusion. By such amisconception, evil men who oppose the Lord may be accepted as His intimateassociates, and persons inimical to Kåñëa may be thought of as His surrendereddependents appearing in His own family. The purpose of the destruction of theYadu dynasty was to eradicate the false logic of the Mäyävädés who desire tosee everything as one in all respects and who therefore improperly reason thatthe enemies of Kåñëa's devotees can be His intimate family members.</div>

<div class="First">The sages called to Vasudeva's house to perform such auspicious religiousactivities were satisfied with proper gifts and then sent by Kåñëa to Piëòäraka,a nearby holy place situated about two miles from the Arabian Sea on thecoast of Gujarat. Its current name is still Piëòäraka.Significantly, Lord Kåñëa is mentioned here as kälätmanä, the form of time,or the Supersoul. In the Eleventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä the SupremePersonality of Godhead reveals Himself to Arjuna as time personified,appearing on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra to destroy all the kings and armieswho constitute a burden to the earth. Similarly, kälätmanä nivasatäyadu-deva-gehe: Kåñëa was staying in the home of His father Vasudeva as timepersonified, thus indicating that the time was approaching for the destruction of His own dynasty according to His desire.</div>

<div class="Translation"> To that holy place, the young boys of the Yadu dynasty had brought Sämba, son of Jämbavaté, dressed in woman's garb. Playfully approaching the great sages gathered there, the boys grabbed hold of the sages' feet and impudently asked them with feigned humility, "O learned brähmaëas, this black-eyed pregnant woman has something to ask you. She is too embarrassed to inquire for herself. She is just about to give birth and is very desirous of having a son. Since all of you are great sages with infallible vision, please tell us whether her child will be a boy or a girl."</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté has made the following comment: "Theimpudent behavior of the young Yadus toward the sages headed by Närada,who were all brähmaëas and devotees of the Lord, was a display of deviationfrom the path of Lord Kåñëa. Similarly, although the präkåta-sahajiyäs think ofthemselves as intimate associates of Kåñëa, the supremely merciful Lord'sdetermination is perfectly correct in working to finish such false devotees.Such impostors actually never accept real service to Kåñëa. The yadu-kumäras'deception is termed 'seemingly humble,' meaning that in fact they wereanything but humble. Therefore, the ridiculing of Vaiñëavas by the Lord'sfamily resulted in a great offense against the devotees of the Lord."A similar incident occurred during the pastimes of Çré CaitanyaMahäprabhu when His own mother offended Çré Advaita Äcärya. Çré CaitanyaMahäprabhu personally rectified this offense against a great Vaiñëava, andthus the Lord showed His magnanimity. Lord Kåñëa's pastime of destroying theYadu dynasty is also a demonstration of His mercy to His devotees.Believing the brähmaëas, Vaiñëavas and åñis to be foolishly lackingknowledge in material affairs of sense gratification, the yadu-kumäras dressedSämba, the son of Jämbavaté, as a woman and tried to mock the saintlyassembly. Lord Kåñëa wanted to teach that such an offense committed againstgreat devotees by His associate Sämba would be the cause of the Yadu dynasty's destruction, all as part of His lélä.</div>
<div class="First">In modern times such misbehavior has also manifested itself within theGauòéya Vaiñëava community. Unauthorized persons have initiated theprocess of deceitfully bestowing a woman's dress on their followers. Thisprocess is to be counted as a variety of aparädha, or offense against Kåñëa.Such an attempt to cheapen and ridicule devotional service to Kåñëa iscertainly caused by envy toward the real Vaiñëavas, who are faithfully engagedin devotional service according to the rules and regulations of the Vedic literature. Thus Rüpa Gosvämé has said:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">çruti-småti-puräëädipaïcarätra-</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">vidhià vinä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">aikäntiké harer bhaktir</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">utpätäyaiva kalpate</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">[Brs. 1.2.101(86)]</div>
<div class="First">"If one wants to demonstrate his great devotion to the Supreme Lord but hisprocess of devotional service violates the standard rules of revealed scripturessuch as çruti, småti, Puräëas and Närada-païcarätra, then his alleged love ofGodhead will simply disturb society by misleading people from the auspiciouspath of spiritual advancement." (Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 1.2.101) The taking ofa woman's clothing by a man in kåñëa-lélä was intended to point out this fact.Such an act amounts to cheating and ridicule of the devotees of Kåñëa. Sämbais a personal associate of the Lord, but acting as a harbinger of the futuremisfortune to be created in Kali-yuga by bogus followers of Çré CaitanyaMahäprabhu, Sämba displayed this didactic pastime to help the living entitiesbe blessed on the correct path of devotional service.The boys said to the sages, "O åñis, O brähmaëas, O Närada and other greatpersonalities, can you tell us whether it will be a son or a daughter that will beborn from this pregnant woman's womb?" By addressing pure Vaiñëavas in thisway, they anticipated the fraudulent sampradäyas of the modern age in theirpractice of sakhé-bheka, or dressing men as female associates of the gopés. Thisunauthorized activity constitutes contempt and mockery of the pure devotees of the Lord.</div>
<div class="First">Many false yogés, imagining they are distributing first-class devotion on theliberated platform, attempt to award the status of "pure devotee" to candidatestotally ignorant of the transcendental tastes of madhura-rati, or the Lord'sconjugal love in the spiritual world. Even though they know that the generalpopulace is unfit to imitate the liberated associates of the Lord, they artificiallydecorate ordinary persons with the ornaments of spiritual perfection, such astears, a melted heart, and the standing on end of the bodily hairs. Thus thesebogus yogés introduce a process that misleads the world. Because Çré CaitanyaMahäprabhu understood that the great misfortune caused by such false yogés,or kuyogés, was impossible to forestall in the Kali-yuga, He infected them withinsane desires for material objects of lust so that ordinary persons can easilyidentify such false yogés as deviated from the path of pure devotional service.The mockery of the brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas by the young boys of theYadu dynasty who dressed Sämba in woman's garb, and the resultantdestruction of the Yadu dynasty, conclusively demonstrate the uselessness of the sahajiyä-sampradäyas.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has confirmed that the lack of humility shown by thesons of the Yadu dynasty was an arrangement by the Lord Himself. In otherwords, the members of the Yadu dynasty are ultimately associates of LordKåñëa, and to facilitate the instructive pastimes of the Lord they acted in apparently unethical ways.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The four defects of the conditioned soul, namely the tendency to commitmistakes (bhrama), illusion (pramäda), imperfect senses (karaëäpäöava) andthe tendency to cheat (vipralipsä), are not found in pure devotees of the Lord.Lord Kåñëa, however, arranged for the young members of His own family, theYadu dynasty, to exhibit the dangerous lower propensities of mankind. Thusthe Yädava boys imitated the activities of the followers of a pseudodevotional cult.</div>
<div class="First">Just before His disappearance, Kåñëa desired that the sages become angry atthe young members of the Yadu dynasty, in order to teach that Vaiñëavascannot be thought of as foolish, ignorant or mundane and to reduce the falsepride of His own family members. Sometimes misguided persons assume theroles of pseudodevotees and blaspheme the actual process of pure devotionalservice and the pure devotees who are surrendered to preaching the mission ofthe Lord. Such foolish pseudodevotees think that their hatred or envy of theactual preaching mission of the Lord constitutes bhakti, but in fact itconstitutes the cause of all trouble both for them and for the unfortunatepeople who follow them. The preachers of pure devotional service expose thepernicious attempts of pseudodevotees, and similarly the sages headed byNärada, who were all exalted devotees of the Lord, addressed the young boys ofthe Yadu dynasty as bewildered fools and told them, "Within this false wombor false dress of a sädhu, a club will take birth that will be the source of your dynasty's destruction."</div>
<div class="First">Especially in India, but now also in the Western countries, there is a class ofpolluted sense enjoyers who also call themselves Gauòéya Vaiñëavas andpretend to exhibit the highest state of prema-bhakti. They declare that they areon the highest stage of devotion and therefore concerned only with the mostintimate affairs of mädhurya-lélä, as exhibited in Våndävana. Sometimes theyeven dress as gopés, making a false show of entering into the pastimes of Kåñëawithout actually following the standard regulations. In the name ofprema-bhakti, they sometimes commit grievous offenses against the puredevotees of Kåñëa. By this incident concerning the iron club from the so-calledwomb of Sämba, Lord Kåñëa Himself taught the dangerous results of such pseudodevotion.</div>

This example shows that in a polluted society the clubof duplicity can never bring the peace found in the society of devotees. Rather,such duplicity smashes all the nondevotional activities and whimsicaldoctrines of the pseudodevotees. The Yadu boys were wary about jeopardizingtheir advanced position and indeed had been thinking that as long as theykept their trickery concealed, others would never be able to detect suchsophisticated cheating.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Ordinary persons may be surprised or bewildered that the Lord gladlysanctioned the cursing and destruction of His own dynasty. The wordanvamodata used here indicates taking pleasure in something, or givingsanction or approval. It is also mentioned, käla-rüpé: Kåñëa gladly gave Hissanction to the brähmaëas' curse in the form of time. Çréla BhaktisiddhäntaSarasvaté Prabhupäda has commented that the Supreme Lord, Kåñëacandra,decided to maintain the curse intact in order to protect the actual principles ofreligion and destroy the unbecoming offense of the deceitful members of theKärñëa dynasty. It is clearly explained in Bhagavad-gétä that the whole purposeof the Lord's descent into the material world is to reestablish the authenticprinciples of religion by which the conditioned souls who are sufferingintensely under the laws of material nature can regain their originalexistential status as eternally liberated servants of the Supreme Personality ofGodhead, Kåñëa. The living entity comes to this material world with a desireto lord it over material nature, although the living entity is in fact not a lordbut an eternal servant. Due to this perverted tendency to exploit the entireworld for his sense gratification, the living entity is also prone to try to pervertthe principles of spiritual life so that the eternal religious principles becomeappropriate to his own material sense gratification. Religion, however, ismeant for pleasing the Supreme Lord by obeying His laws. And therefore LordKåñëa Himself personally comes from time to time to revive and enliven thecorrect method of devotional service to His lotus feet. In the Eleventh Cantoof Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is clearly stated that Lord Kåñëa had completed thevast majority of His pastimes on the earth and was now making the finalarrangements for His departure. Therefore, He wished to leave behind a vividlesson for the living entities of this age that any so-called religious person,even if he is so exalted as to take birth in the Lord's personal family, cannotviolate the respect and reverence which is due to the pure devotees of theLord, such as Närada Muni. The principle of serving the pure devotee of Kåñëais so essential for spiritual advancement that the Lord exhibited theinconceivable pastime of causing the destruction of His entire dynasty just toimpress this point upon the conditioned souls of Kali-yuga.Çrémad-Bhägavatam hints at the great misfortunes that would come afterthe disappearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such misfortunesalso occurred after the disappearance of Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, whois accepted by Gauòéya Vaiñëavas as Kåñëa Himself. Through variousinstructions, the Bhägavatam provides for eliminating the cheatingpseudoreligion that comes forth in human society after the departure of the Lord.</div>
<div class="First">Lord Caitanya, exhibiting His magnanimous pastimes, drove away fromSouth India all the false doctrines of the apasampradäyas, or so-called disciplictraditions of pseudodevotees, who had gained great influence by resorting tothe atheistic theories of the Buddhists and Jains. Thus He turned all of Indiatoward the devotional service of Lord Kåñëa, so that due to the extensivepreaching of Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu and His followers there remained notopic of discussion in the world other than devotional service to the SupremeLord. Tridaëòipäda Prabodhänanda Sarasvaté has elaborated on this in his verse stré-puträdi-kathäà jahur viñayiëaù.</div>
<div class="First">Çré Narahari Sarakära Öhäkura, in his book Kåñëa-bhajanämåta, hascorrected the improper statements of the gauräìga-nägaré-vädés,sakhébheka-vädés, and others of the eleven pseudodisciplic chains that claim tofollow Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. These unauthorized persons presentcheating in the guise of religion and advertise their duplicity as kathä, or pureworship of the Lord. Just as Kåñëa brought about a furious quarrel to destroyHis own family, Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu arranged for the world to be floodedby varieties of Mäyäväda and karma-väda philosophies just after Hisdisappearance. He did this to destroy persons who belonged to the elevenapasampradäyas, or unauthorized disciplic traditions, as well as the many otherapasampradäyas that would appear in the future and presume to callthemselves devotees of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu or pretend to be descendantsin His family line. At the same time, Caitanya Mahäprabhu arranged for Hisown men to be kept away from the pseudodevotion of these cheaters. Thedevotees of Lord Gaurasundara, Caitanya Mahäprabhu, can discern themysteries of His pastimes that manifest in the pastimes of Lord Kåñëa. Theactivities of the transcendental body of the Supreme Personality of Godheadcannot be understood in any ordinary mundane way. That is the essential meaning of this chapter.</div>
<div class="First">Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, First Chapter, of theÇrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Curse Upon the Yadu Dynasty."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">2. Mahäräja Nimi Meets the Nine Yogendras</div>
<div class="First">In this chapter Närada gives instructions in bhägavata-dharma to thefaithful and inquisitive Vasudeva by recounting a conversation between Mahäräja Nimi and the nine Yogendras.</div>
<div class="First">Greatly eager to see Lord Kåñëa, Devarñi Närada resided almost exclusivelyin Dvärakä. Vasudeva, bewildered by the Lord's illusory potency, hadpreviously offered worship to the Supreme Lord Ananta for the purpose ofgetting a son, but had failed to worship Him for liberation.Once Närada arrived at the home of Vasudeva, who worshiped himaccording to proper etiquette, greeted him respectfully and requested to hearabout pure devotional service, which frees one from all kinds of fear. Näradapraised Vasudeva's fixed intelligence and then related the ancient history ofthe conversation between the nine Yogendras, who were sons of Lord Åñabhadeva, and Nimi, the King of Videha.</div>
<div class="First">Sväyambhuva Manu's son was Priyavrata. His son was Ägnédhra, whose sonwas Näbhi. Lord Åñabhadeva, the plenary portion of Väsudeva, incarnated asthe son of Näbhi. The oldest of Åñabhadeva's one hundred sons was Bharata,an exalted devotee of Näräyaëa by whose name this earth, previously calledAjanäbha-varña, became famous as Bhärata-varña. Nine other sons ofÅñabhadeva were widely known as the nava-yogendras: Kavi, Havir, Antarékña,Prabuddha, Pippaläyana, Ävirhotra, Drumila, Camasa and Karabhäjana. Theywere well versed in knowledge of the self, fixed in their goal and alwaysstriving for perfection. Nine other sons of Åñabhadeva took on the duty ofkñatriyas and became masters of the nine dvépas comprising Bhärata-varña. Hisother eighty-one sons became brähmaëas expert in småti doctrines who propagated the path of fruitive sacrifice.</div>
<div class="First">The nine Yogendras, free to move without impediment, traveledeverywhere as they wished. They were direct associates of the SupremePersonality of Godhead, Madhusüdana, and wandered freely to give protectionto the various planets in the universe. The human body can be lost at anymoment, but it is still a very rare attainment. Still rarer is to get theassociation of the confidential devotees of the Lord of Vaikuëöha while in thisvery human body. The association of such saintly persons, even for a fractionof a second, bestows all benefits on a living being. Therefore King Nimioffered the nine Yogendras suitable seats, worshiped them, humbled himselfwith obeisances and joyfully inquired from them about bhägavata-dharma.Bhägavata-dharma, or pure devotional service to the Lord, is the only means ofultimate good fortune for the soul. The Supreme Lord, being pleased by such service, offers His own self to the devotee.</div>
<div class="First">In answer to the King's question, one of the nine Yogendras, Kavi, spoke asfollows: "Those means of advancement which are described by the Personalityof Godhead Himself and which enable even foolish persons easily to achieveperfect self-realization are called bhägavata-dharma. This bhägavata-dharma,manifested as service to the lotus feet of the infallible Supreme Lord,eradicates all fear for the living being. By abiding in bhägavata-dharma one willnever stumble or fall, even while running with both eyes closed. Whatever onedoes with his body, mind, words, intelligence, consciousness, senses andnatural proclivities should all be offered to Lord Näräyaëa. Living entitiesaverse to the Lord's lotus feet come under the control of the Lord's illusoryenergy, mäyä. They forget the Lord's identity and are trapped by the illusion ofidentifying with the temporary body. Under the sway of material attraction,they become greatly fearful. Thus the best thing for them is to surrender theirvery life energy to a qualified guru and execute worship of the Supreme Lord,the absolute controller of mäyä, with pure devotion. Just as by eating onegradually appeases his hunger and with every bite feels more and more satisfiedand nourished, a surrendered devotee achieves detachment from all objectsother than Kåñëa, gains direct personal experience of the Lord and relishes pure love for the Lord, all simultaneously."</div>
<div class="First">Next Havir spoke, describing the different characteristics of first-class,second-class and third-class devotees: "One who offers prescribed worship withfaith to the Deity of Lord Viñëu but has no devotion for Vaiñëavas and thingsrelated to Viñëu is a materialistic devotee. One who shows love for the Lord,friendship for the Lord's devotees, mercy for the ignorant and indifference forthe enemies of Viñëu and the Vaiñëavas is an intermediate devotee. And onewho sees the presence of the Supreme Lord in everything and sees everythingwithin the Lord is the topmost devotee." The first-class devotees are describedin eight verses, which conclude by stating that the first-class devotee keeps theSupreme Lord perpetually fastened to his own heart with ropes of affection. Lord Hari never leaves the heart of such a devotee.</div>

<div class="First">In the Second Chapter of this canto, bhägavata-dharma, or pure devotionalservice to Kåñëa, is explained by Närada Muni to Vasudeva, who had inquiredwith devotion. Närada Muni cites a conversation between King Nimi and theJäyanteyas. According to Jéva Gosvämé, the word abhékñëam indicates thatalthough Närada Muni was frequently sent by Lord Kåñëa here and there forvarious pastimes, such as inquiring about the affairs of the world, Näradacontinuously returned to reside in Dvärakä. The word kåñëopäsana-lälasaùindicates that Närada was very eager to be near Kåñëa and worship Him.Because of the curse of Dakña, Närada is never allowed to live continuously inone place. Çrédhara Svämé, however, has pointed out, na tasyäà çäpädeùprabhävaù: in Dvärakä there is no influence of curses or other such evils,because Dvärakä is the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and isalways protected by His arms, as shown by the word govinda-bhuja-guptäyäm.The conditioned souls are struggling within the kingdom of mäyä against thecruel laws of material nature, such as birth, death, old age and disease, but ifsuch conditioned souls have the good fortune to enter the city of the SupremePersonality of Godhead, whether Dvärakä, Mathurä or Våndävana, and livethere under the direct protection of the omnipotent arms of the SupremeLord, Kåñëa, they will experience the unlimited transcendental bliss of reallife, which is eternal and which is meant to be lived in the personal company of God.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear King, in the material world the conditioned souls are confronted by death at every step of life. Therefore, who among the conditioned souls would not render service to the lotus feet of Lord Mukunda, who is worshipable even for the greatest of liberated souls?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The word indriyavän is significant in this verse. Indriyavän means"possessing senses." Although we are conditioned within the material world, bythe mercy of the Supreme Lord we are awarded a human body, which possessesdistinct senses, such as the eyes, ears, tongue, nose and skin. Generally theconditioned souls use these senses in a false attempt to exploit the materialnature for sense gratification. But our material senses and their objects aretemporary, and it is not possible to become peaceful or happy in the attempt togratify our temporary senses with the temporary sense objects offered by mäyä,the illusory energy of the Lord. In fact, our strenuous endeavor to satisfy thematerial senses inevitably brings exactly the opposite result, namely materialsuffering. A man is attracted to a woman. Being sexually aroused he marriesher, and soon there is a family that requires ever-increasing support. In thisway his innocent and simple life is ended, and he spends the major portion ofhis life working hard like an ass to support the demands of his family. In theThird Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Lord Kapila describes very clearly that inspite of the exhausting work a man performs throughout his life, his family isultimately dissatisfied, and when the exhausted father reaches old age, theirritated family members look upon him just as farmers look upon an old anduseless ox. Sometimes the sons dream of receiving their father's money as aninheritance and secretly wish for him to die. Nowadays people strongly resentthe trouble of caring for elderly parents and therefore send them to aninstitution, where they die lonely and neglected after a life of hard work fortheir so-called loved ones. One doctor in England is seriously proposingeuthanasia for elderly persons who are no longer productive.Nowadays some people, desiring material sense gratification but hoping toavoid the inconvenience of family life, try to enjoy "free" sexual relations withwomen, without the trouble of marriage. Through birth control and abortionthey eliminate the disturbance of caring for children. In this way they hope toenjoy material sense gratification without any material impediment. By thelaws of nature, however, such persons become bound in a network of sinfulreactions by avoiding their real duty to the Supreme Personality of Godheadand by thoughtlessly causing violence and suffering to others for increasingtheir own sense gratification. Caught in a network of impious activities, theydrift further and further away from their original pure consciousness andgradually lose all power to understand the laws of nature. Therefore it is statedhere, sarvato-måtyuù. Måtyu means "death." Death suddenly appears, startlingsuch confident sense gratifiers, and destroys their entire program of so-calledmaterial happiness. Often such persons are afflicted with ghastly diseases andundergo inconceivable suffering, which ends in death. If a sincere well-wisherpoints these facts out to them, trying to inform them of the reality, theybecome angry and accuse him of being a pessimist or a religious fanatic. In thisway they blindly ignore the laws of nature until these laws inevitably smashthem down and drag them out of their fool's paradise. Because of an excessiveaccumulation of sinful results, they are forced into situations of great distressby the laws of karma. Sinking down into the lower species of life, they lose allawareness of that which lies beyond their gross material senses.Sometimes a living being is able to understand the miserable result ofmaterialistic sense gratification. Being frustrated by the pain and suffering ofmaterialistic life and being ignorant of any superior life, he adopts aneo-Buddhist philosophy and seeks shelter in so-called nothingness. But thereis no actual void within the kingdom of God. The desire to merge intonothingness is a reaction against material pain; it is not a tangible concept ofthe Supreme. For example, if I feel unbearable pain in my leg and the paincannot be cured, I may finally agree to have my leg amputated. But it is farbetter to remove the pain and keep my leg. Similarly, because of false ego wethink, "I am everything. I am the most important person. No one is asintelligent as me." Thinking in this way, we suffer constantly and experienceintense anxiety. But as soon as we purify the ego by admitting that we areinsignificant eternal servants of Kåñëa, our ego will give us great pleasure.Çré Kåñëa, the Lord of the blissfully variegated spiritual sky, calledVaikuëöha, is always absorbed in transcendental enjoyment. In fact, Çré Kåñëais the reservoir of all pleasure. People absorbed in materialistic enjoyment arebound by the laws of omnipresent death, but if we endeavor instead to servethe Supreme Personality of Godhead, we can immediately be connected to Hishlädiné çakti, or blissful potency. If we serve Kåñëa under the guidance of Hisauthorized representative, the spiritual master, we can immediately get relieffrom material distress. Then we shall not yearn after nothing, but instead weshall be able to relish unlimited spiritual bliss in the service of the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="First">Sarvato-måtyuù also indicates that birth and death occur on every planet inthe universe. Therefore our so-called space travel and cosmic consciousness areuseless, since there is no eternal life anywhere within the material cosmos. Inconclusion, to understand the futility of engaging in the service of anythingother than Kåñëa and to engage instead in serving that which is eternal andfull of bliss is the highest possible development of intelligence. Although ourpresent intelligence is narrow, being conditioned by the laws of nature, we cancreate unlimited good fortune for ourselves by taking shelter of the lotus feetof Mukunda, learning to discriminate between that which is temporary and useless and that which is eternal and real.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Vasudeva herein describes the glories of Närada Muni. The wordskåpaëänäà yathä pitror uttama-çloka-vartmanäm are significant. Kåpaëänämrefers to the most wretched persons, whereas uttama-çloka-vartmanäm refers tothe most fortunate, those who are advanced in Kåñëa consciousness. ÇrédharaSvämé has stated, tathä bhagavad-rüpasya bhavato yäträ sarva-dehinäm svastayaiti. The word bhagavad-rüpasya indicates that Närada Muni is an expansion ofthe Supreme Lord and that his activities therefore bring immense benefit forall living beings. In the First Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Närada Muni isdescribed as a manifestation of the mercy of the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. There it is stated that Närada is especially empowered to giveinstructions in the art of devotional service to Kåñëa. Närada is especially ableto advise the conditioned souls as to how they can dovetail their presentactivities with the devotional service of Kåñëa without unnecessarily disrupting their present life.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté has defined the word kåpaëa by quotingfrom the Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad (3.9.10). Etad akñaraà gärgi aviditväsmällokät praiti sa kåpaëaù: "O daughter of Gargäcärya, he who leaves this worldwithout learning about the infallible Supreme is a kåpaëa, or miser." In otherwords, we are awarded the human form of life so that we may understand oureternal, blissful relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Asindicated in verse 2 of this chapter by the word indriyavän, the human body isspecifically awarded so that we may serve the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa. Thishuman form of body is the greatest fortune because the highly evolvedintelligence of human life enables us to understand Kåñëa, the Absolute Truth.If we are unable to understand our eternal relationship with God, we shallderive no permanent benefit whatsoever in this present life, nor can weultimately benefit others. One who receives a great treasure but can neitheruse it himself nor dedicate it to the happiness of others is called a miser.Therefore, a person who leaves this world without having understood hisactual position as servant of God is called a kåpaëa, or miser.This verse states that Närada Muni is so empowered in the devotionalservice of Kåñëa that he can lift even miserly rascals out of their illusion, justas a kind father goes to his child and wakes him from a distressing nightmare.Our present materialistic life is just like a troublesome dream, from whichgreat souls such as Närada can wake us. Närada Muni is so powerful that eventhose already advanced in devotional service to Kåñëa can greatly enhancetheir spiritual position by hearing his instructions, as they will be given here inthe Eleventh Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Therefore Çré Närada is the guruand father of all living beings, who are originally devotees of the Lord but whoare now artificially attempting to enjoy the material world in the material bodies of human beings, animals, and so on.</div>

<div class="First">This verse clearly states that the pure devotees of the Lord such as NäradaMuni are saintly persons, to be considered superior even to the demigods, theliving beings empowered by the Supreme Lord to administer the entire universe. In Bhagavad-gétä (3.12) it is stated:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">iñöän bhogän hi vo devä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">däsyante yajïa-bhävitäù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tair dattän apradäyaibhyo</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yo bhuìkte stena eva saù</div>
<div class="First">"The demigods in charge of the various necessities of life, being satisfied by theperformance of yajïa [sacrifice], supply all necessities to man. But one whoenjoys these gifts without offering them in return to the demigods is certainlya thief." In this connection Çréla Prabhupäda has made the following commentregarding the demigods: "The demigods are empowered administrators ofmaterial affairs. The supply of air, light, water and other blessings formaintaining the body and the soul of all living entities are entrusted to thedemigods, who are innumerable assistants in the different parts of the body ofthe Supreme Personality of Godhead. Their pleasure and displeasure dependon the performance of yajïas by the human being." In other words, by theLord's arrangement, material prosperity depends upon the satisfaction of thedemigods. If the demigods are dissatisfied due to nonperformance or improperperformance of sacrifice, they are empowered to impose various types ofsuffering upon human beings. Usually this suffering takes the form of eitherexcessive or insufficient supply of material necessities. For example, sunshineis necessary for life, but if there is excessive heat or insufficient heat from thesun, we suffer. Excessive or insufficient rain is also a cause of suffering. Thusthe demigods bestow either happiness or suffering upon human beings, in accordance with the performance of sacrifice.</div>
<div class="First">As stated here, however, great saintly persons such as Närada Muni are always merciful to all living beings.</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">sädhavaù sädhu-bhüñaëäù</div>
<div class="First">"The symptoms of a sädhu are that he is tolerant, merciful and friendly to allliving entities, he has no enemies, he is peaceful, he abides by the scriptures,and all his characteristics are sublime." (SB 3.25.21) Çréla Prabhupäda, in hiscommentary on this verse, has portrayed the sädhu as follows: "A sädhu asdescribed above is a devotee of the Lord. His concern, therefore, is toenlighten people in devotional service to the Lord. That is his mercy. Heknows that without devotional service to the Lord, human life is spoiled. Adevotee travels all over the country door to door preaching, 'Be Kåñëaconscious. Be a devotee of Lord Kåñëa. Don't spoil your life in simply fulfillingyour animal propensities. Human life is meant for self-realization, or Kåñëaconsciousness.' These are the preachings of a sädhu. He is not satisfied with hisown liberation. He always thinks about others. He is the most compassionatepersonality toward all the fallen souls. One of his qualifications, therefore, iskäruëika, great mercy to the fallen souls. While engaged in preaching work hehas to meet with so many opposing elements, and therefore the sädhu, ordevotee of the Lord, has to be very tolerant. Someone may ill-treat him,because the conditioned souls are not prepared to receive the transcendentalknowledge of devotional service. They do not like it; that is their disease. Thesädhu has the thankless task of impressing upon them the importance ofdevotional service. Sometimes devotees are personally attacked with violence.Lord Jesus Christ was crucified. Haridäsa Öhäkura was caned in twenty-twomarketplaces, and Lord Caitanya's principal assistant, Nityänanda, wasviolently attacked by Jagäi and Mädhäi. But still they were tolerant becausetheir mission was to deliver the fallen souls. One of the qualifications of asädhu is that he is very tolerant and is merciful to all fallen souls. He ismerciful because he is a well-wisher of all living entities. He is not only awell-wisher of human society, but a well-wisher of animal society as well. It issaid here, sarva-dehinäm, which indicates all living entities who have acceptedmaterial bodies. Not only does a human being have a material body, but otherliving entities, such as cats and dogs, also have material bodies. The devotee ofthe Lord is merciful to everyone—the cats, dogs, trees, etc. He treats all livingentities in such a way that they can ultimately get salvation from this materialentanglement. Çivänanda Sena, one of the disciples of Lord Caitanya, gaveliberation to a dog by treating the dog transcendentally. There are manyinstances where a dog got salvation by association with a sädhu, because asädhu engages in the highest philanthropic activities for the benediction of allliving entities. Although the sädhu is not inimical toward anyone, the world is so ungrateful that even a sädhu has many enemies.</div>
<div class="First">"What is the difference between an enemy and a friend? It is a difference inbehavior. A sädhu behaves with all conditioned souls for their ultimate relieffrom material entanglement. Therefore, no one can be more friendly than thesädhu in relieving a conditioned soul. A sädhu is calm, and he quietly andpeacefully follows the principles of scripture and at the same time is a devoteeof the Lord. One who actually follows the principles of scripture must be adevotee of God because all the çästras instruct us to obey the orders of thePersonality of Godhead. Sädhu, therefore, means a follower of the scripturalinjunctions and a devotee of the Lord. All these characteristics are prominentin a devotee. A devotee develops all the good qualities of the demigods,whereas a nondevotee, even though academically qualified, has no actual goodqualifications or good characteristics according to the standards of transcendental realization."</div>
<div class="First">Vasudeva, therefore, has used the word sädhu to describe Närada Muni,indicating that the position of the devotee of the Lord is superior even to that of the demigods.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The words chäyeva karma-saciväù are significant here. Chäyä means"shadow." The shadow of the body precisely follows the movements of thebody. The shadow has no power to move in a way different from themovement of the body. Similarly, as stated here, bhajanti ye yathä devän deväapi tathäiva tän: the results the demigods award to living beings correspondexactly to the living beings' actions. The demigods are empowered by the Lordto follow precisely the particular karma of a living entity in awarding himhappiness and distress. Just as a shadow cannot move independently, thedemigods cannot punish or reward a living being independently. Although thedemigods are millions of times more powerful than the human beings on earth,they are ultimately tiny servants of God whom the Lord allows to play as thecontrollers of the universe. In the Fourth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, PåthuMahäräja, an empowered incarnation of the Lord, states that even thedemigods are subject to punishment by the Lord if they deviate from His laws.On the other hand, devotees of the Lord such as Närada Muni, by their potentpreaching, can interfere in the karma of a living being by persuading him togive up his fruitive activity and mental speculation and surrender to theSupreme Personality of Godhead. In material existence, one works hard underthe bondage of ignorance. But if one becomes enlightened by association witha pure devotee of the Lord, one can understand one's actual position as aneternal servant of God. By rendering such service, one dissolves hisattachment to the material world and the reactions of his previous activities,and as a surrendered soul he is endowed with unlimited spiritual freedom inthe service of the Lord. In this regard, the Brahma-saàhitä (5.54) states:yas tv indragopam athavendram aho sva-karmabandhänurüpa-</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">phala-bhäjanam ätanoti</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">karmäëi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhäjäà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi</div>
<div class="First">"I adore the primeval Lord, Govinda, who burns to the root all the fruitiveactivities of those imbued with devotion. For those who walk the path ofwork—no less for Indra, king of the demigods, than for the tiny insectindragopa—He impartially ordains the due enjoyments of the fruits ofactivities in accordance with the chain of works previously performed." Eventhe demigods are bound to the laws of karma, whereas a pure devotee of theLord, having completely given up the desire for material enjoyment, successfully burns to ashes all traces of karma.</div>
<div class="First">In this regard, Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has commentedthat unless one is engaged as a surrendered soul in the devotional service ofthe Lord, he cannot actually be considered niñkäma, or free from all personaldesire. Sometimes a materialistic person will engage in charity or altruisticactivities and in this way consider himself a selfless worker. Similarly, thosewho engage in mental speculation with the ultimate goal of merging into theimpersonal Brahman aspect of the Lord also advertise themselves as beingselfless or desireless. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté, however,such karmés and jïänés, while busy in their so-called "selflessness," are in factservants of lusty desires. In other words, they have not perfectly understoodtheir position as eternal servants of God. The altruistic karmé falsely considershimself the best friend of humanity, although he is unable to give actualbenefit to others because he is ignorant of the eternal life of bliss andknowledge beyond the temporary hallucination of material existence.Similarly, although the jïäné proudly declares himself God and invites othersto become God also, he neglects to explain how the so-called gods have cometo be bound by the laws of material nature. Actually, the attempt to becomeGod is based not on love of God but on the desire to take the same status asGod. In other words, the desire to be equal in all respects to the Supreme issimply another materialistic desire. Therefore the karmés and jïänés, because oftheir dissatisfaction in artificially trying to fulfill their own desires, can showno actual mercy to the fallen souls. In this regard, Çré Madhväcärya has quoted the Uddäma-saàhitä:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sukham icchanti bhütänäà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">präyo duùkhäsahä nåëäm</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tathäpi tebhyaù pravarä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">devä eva hareù priyäù</div>
<div class="First">"Åñis want happiness for all beings and are almost always incapable oftolerating the unhappiness of men. Nevertheless, the demigods are superiorbecause they are very dear to Lord Hari." But although Çréla Madhväcärya hasplaced the demigods in a higher position than the merciful åñis, Çréla JévaGosvämé has stated, sädhavas tu na karmänugatäù: the sädhus are actuallybetter than the demigods because the sädhus are merciful regardless of thepious or impious acts of the conditioned souls. This apparent disagreementbetween Madhväcärya and Jéva Gosvämé is resolved by BhaktisiddhäntaSarasvaté Öhäkura, who points out that in the statement by ÇrélaMadhväcärya, the word åñi, or "sage," indicates the so-called sädhus or saintlypersons among the karmés and jïänés. Ordinary fruitive workers andspeculative philosophers certainly consider themselves to be at the summit ofpious morality and altruism. However, since they are ignorant of the supremeposition of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they cannot be consideredequal to the demigods, who are all devotees of the Lord and aware that allliving beings are eternal servants of the Lord. Even such demigods, however,cannot be compared to the pure devotees such as Närada. Such pure devoteesare empowered to award the highest perfection of life to both pious andimpious living beings, who have only to follow the orders of such pure devotees.</div>

<div class="First">According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, Närada Muni might have been reluctantto instruct Vasudeva because of natural respect for Vasudeva's exalted positionas the father of Kåñëa. Närada might have thought that since Vasudeva wasalready perfect in Kåñëa consciousness there was no need to instruct him inthe process of devotional service. Therefore, anticipating Närada's possiblereluctance, Vasudeva specifically requested Närada to preach to him aboutdevotional service to Kåñëa. This is the symptom of a pure devotee. A puredevotee of Kåñëa never considers himself exalted. To the contrary, he meeklyfeels that his devotional service is most imperfect but that somehow or otherLord Kåñëa, out of His causeless mercy, is accepting such imperfect service.</div>

<div class="First">"One can chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, feelinghimself lower than the straw in the street. One should be more tolerant than atree, devoid of all sense of false prestige, and ready to offer all respect toothers." (Çikñäñöaka 3) The conditioned souls in this material world becomefalsely proud of their so-called family lineage. This pride is false because onewho has taken birth in the material world is in a fallen situation, even in thebest of cases. Vasudeva, however, was certainly not fallen, since he had takenbirth in the family of Kåñëa. Since he was Kåñëa's father, his position was mostexalted, yet because he was a pure devotee he did not become proud of hisspecial relationship with Kåñëa. Instead, considering himself deficient inspiritual understanding, he took advantage of the appearance of Närada Muni,a great preacher of Kåñëa consciousness, by immediately inquiring from himabout devotional service. This incomparable humility of a pure devotee ofKåñëa is far superior to the false humility of the impersonalist, who actuallymaintains a desire to be equal to God though adopting the external behavior of a meek and saintly person.</div>
<div class="First">Bhayam, or fear, is caused by seeing something other than Kåñëa(dvitéyäbhiniveçataù). Everything is actually an emanation from the SupremePersonality of Godhead, as stated in Vedänta-sutra (janmädy asya yataù [SB1.1.1]) and as confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä (ahaà sarvasya prabhavaù [Bg. 10.8],väsudevaù sarvam iti, etc. [Bg. 7.19]). Kåñëa is the well-wishing friend of everyliving entity (suhådam sarva-bhütänäm [Bg. 5.29]). If a living being gives up hismisguided attempt to defy the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrendersto the Lord, certainly he becomes confident in his eternal relationship withKåñëa. A surrendered soul can actually experience that Kåñëa is hiswell-wishing friend, and since that friend is the supreme absolute controller ofall existence, there is certainly no cause for fear. The son of a rich mancertainly feels confident while touring the estate of his father. Similarly, anempowered representative of the government feels confident in the dischargeof his duty. In the same way, a devotee of Kåñëa, acting as a representative ofthe Supreme Lord, feels confident because he can understand at every momentthat the entire material and spiritual creation is strictly under the control ofhis benevolent master. The nondevotee, however, denies the supreme positionof Kåñëa and therefore imagines that something is different from Kåñëa. Forexample, if a servant of the government thinks that there is some dangerousobstacle that cannot be controlled by the government's power, he becomesfearful. If a child feels that there is some power that cannot be subdued by hisfather, then he becomes fearful. Similarly, because we artificially think thatthere is something within existence that is not under the strict control of thebenevolent Lord, we become fearful. Such a concept of a second thing(something other than Kåñëa) is called dvitéyäbhiniveça, and it immediatelycreates a foreign atmosphere of bhayam, or fear. Kåñëa is called abhayaìkara,which means that He destroys all fear in the heart of His devotee.Sometimes so-called scholars, distraught after many years of impersonalspeculation and enjoyment of materialistic life, become fearful and anxious.Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté compares such disturbed philosophers to thebound vulture in the Chändogya Upaniñad. Desiring liberation from fear, suchspeculators unfortunately concoct an imaginary liberation (vimukta-mäninaù)and try to take shelter of impersonal spiritual existence or voidness. But theBhägavatam (10.2.32) states, äruhya kåcchreëa paraà padaà tataù/ patanty adho'nädåta-yuñmad-aìghrayaù: because such speculators have not rectified theiroriginal mistake of rejecting their eternal relationship with the SupremePersonality of Godhead, they fall from their concocted liberation and thusremain in a fearful condition. Vasudeva, however, is openly eager to hear moreand more about devotional service to Kåñëa, and therefore he states, yän çrutväçraddhayä martyo mucyate sarvato bhayät: simply by hearing about puredevotional service to Kåñëa, a conditioned soul can easily free himself from alltypes of fear, and this transcendental freedom is certainly eternal.</div>

<div class="Translation"> In a previous birth on this earth, I worshiped the Supreme Lord, Ananta, who alone can award liberation, but because I desired to have a child, I did not worship Him for liberation. Thus I was bewildered by the Lord's illusory energy.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to Çrédhara Svämé the word kila (meaning "indeed, it is true," "itis said" or "as is well known") indicates that Vasudeva was remembering thewords the Lord had spoken to him when the Lord had appeared as four-armedViñëu in the prison of Kaàsa. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé states that from the anxietyof Vasudeva, which is expressed in this verse by the words apüjayaà namokñäya mohito deva-mäyayä, it is to be discerned that Vasudeva had heard ofthe curse of the brähmaëas at Piëòäraka against the Yadu dynasty and that hecould understand from this curse that the Lord's disappearance from the earthwas imminent. Vasudeva understood that the Lord's manifest pastimes withinthis universe were coming to an end, and he now lamented that he had notdirectly taken advantage of the opportunity to worship Kåñëa to go back home, back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="First">Significantly, Vasudeva has used the word mukti-dam to describe the Lord.Mukti-dam is a synonym of Mukunda, or that personality who can giveliberation from the cycle of birth and death. It is stated in Vedic literature thateven the demigods are bound to the cycle of birth and death, although theirlife span is inconceivably long by earthly calculations. It is the almighty Godalone who can free the conditioned soul from the reactions to his previoussinful activities and award him an eternal life of bliss and knowledge.Vasudeva lamented that he had desired Kåñëa to come to him as a soninstead of desiring to go back to Kåñëa, back to Godhead, to serve the Lord inthe spiritual sky. Commenting on this incident in the Tenth Canto ofÇrémad-Bhägavatam, Çréla Prabhupäda has emphasized that we should desire togo back home, back to Godhead, rather than try to bring the Lord to this worldas our son. Nor can we artificially imitate the severe penances Vasudeva andDevaké performed for thousands of heavenly years in their previous births asSutapä and Påçni. In this connection Çréla Prabhupäda states, "If we want toget the Supreme Personality of Godhead to become one of us in this materialworld, this requires great penance, but if we want to go back to Kåñëa (tyaktvädehaà punar janma naiti mäm eti so 'rjuna [Bg. 4.9]), we need only understandHim and love Him. Through love only we can very easily go back home, backto Godhead." Çréla Prabhupäda goes on to explain that Caitanya Mahäprabhufreely bestows the benediction of love of Kåñëa, which allows one to return toKåñëa's abode, through the chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mantra. This chantingprocess is far more effective in this age than artificial attempts to performsevere penances and austerities. Çréla Prabhupäda concludes, "Therefore, oneneed not undergo severe penances for many thousands of years. One need onlylearn how to love Kåñëa and be always engaged in His service (sevonmukhe hijihvädau svayam eva sphuraty adaù [Brs. 1.2.234(87)]). Then one can very easilygo back home, back to Godhead. Instead of bringing the Lord here for somematerial purpose, to have a son or whatever else, if we go back home, back toGodhead, our real relationship with the Lord is revealed, and we eternallyengage in our eternal relationship. By chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra, wegradually develop our eternal relationship with the Supreme Person and thusattain the perfection called svarüpa-siddhi(88). We should take advantage ofthis benediction and go back home, back to Godhead." (SB 10.3.38 purport)Although Vasudeva and Devaké desired that Kåñëa become their son, itshould be understood that they are devotees eternally situated in love ofKåñëa. As stated by the Lord Himself (SB 10.3.39), mohitau devamäyayä:Vasudeva and Devaké, His pure devotees, were covered by His internalpotency. In the Fourth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (4.1.20) the great sageAtri Muni prayed to the Lord, prajäm ätma-samäà mahyaà prayacchatu:"Kindly be pleased to offer me a son exactly like You." Atri Muni said hewanted a son exactly like the Lord, and therefore he was not a pure devotee,because he had a desire to be fulfilled and that desire was material. If he haddesired the Supreme Personality of Godhead as his child, he would have beencompletely free of material desires because he would have wanted the SupremeAbsolute Truth, but because he wanted a similar child, his desire was material.Thus Atri Muni cannot be counted among the pure devotees. Vasudeva andDevaké, however, did want the Lord Himself, and therefore they were puredevotees of the Lord. In this verse, therefore, Vasudeva's statement apüjayaàna mokñäya mohito deva-mäyayä should be taken to mean that Kåñëa's internalpotency bewildered Vasudeva so that he would desire Kåñëa as his son. Thispaved the way for the Lord's appearance as the son of His loving devotees.</div>

<div class="First">The word mucyema is significant here. In the previous verse Vasudevastated that because he had been bewildered by the illusory energy of the Lordhe could not achieve from the Supreme Personality of Godhead the boon ofliberation. Therefore he is now approaching the pure devotee of the Lord,confident that by the mercy of the Lord's devotee he will certainly achieve liberation from material bondage.</div>
<div class="First">In this connection the words aïjasä, "easily," and addhä, "directly," are veryimportant. Although foolish persons proudly want to jump up directly to theSupreme Personality of Godhead without accepting His pure devotee asspiritual master, those who are experienced in spiritual science know that bysubmission and service at the lotus feet of a pure devotee one directly contactsthe Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (11.17.27)Lord Kåñëa has stated, äcäryaà mäà vijänéyän nävamanyeta karhicit. Thus oneshould understand that the pure devotee of Kåñëa stands on the same spirituallevel as the Lord Himself. This does not mean that a pure devotee is also God,but because of his intimate loving connection with the Lord, he is accepted bythe Lord as being the Lord's very soul. In other words, Kåñëa is always in theheart of His pure devotee, and the pure devotee is always in the heart of Kåñëa.Although Çré Kåñëa is eternally the Supreme Personality of Godhead, onewithout a second, the Lord is more pleased to see His pure devotee worshiped.Therefore the Lord says, äcäryaà mäà vijänéyät. One must offer the samerespect to the Vaiñëava spiritual master as one would offer to the Lord.Therefore as soon as one pleases the Vaiñëava spiritual master, oneimmediately pleases Kåñëa and makes spiritual advancement. The word aïjasämeans that this bona fide process is the easiest method of achieving spiritualperfection. And because the pure devotee is a transparent medium, the wordaddhä, "directly," is used, indicating that service rendered to the pure devoteegoes directly to the lotus feet of Kåñëa, whereas service one whimsically offersto Kåñëa directly, bypassing the bona fide spiritual master, is not actually accepted and is therefore useless.</div>
<div class="First">Those who actually desire the highest perfection, that of going back home,back to the eternal, blissful kingdom of Kåñëa, should study very carefully theexample shown by Çré Vasudeva in these two verses. He indicates thatalthough one cannot achieve liberation by directly worshiping the SupremePersonality of Godhead, one can very easily achieve the perfection of lifesimply by a moment's association with a pure devotee of Lord Kåñëa such asNärada Muni, the exalted Vaiñëava saint among the demigods.According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the word viçvato-bhayät indicates thatVasudeva very much feared the curse of the brähmaëas. As one can becomeperfect by worshiping the Vaiñëavas, by displeasing the Vaiñëavas one canbring about all misfortune. Thus Vasudeva feared the curse delivered by the brähmaëas at Piëòäraka-tértha.</div>

<div class="First">Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has commented that the wordsad-dharma refers to bhägavata-dharma. This is also confirmed by ÇrédharaSvämé. Bhägavata-dharma is spiritually so powerful that even those who byworldly standards are implicated in various ways in sinful behavior can easilybe purified by adopting any of the processes mentioned in this verse. In thepractice of ordinary piety, one worships God with the expectation of receivingsomething in return for one's service. Similarly, the impersonalist aspires forhis own liberation, wishfully thinking that he will become equal to God. Inbhägavata-dharma, however, there is no such impurity. Bhägavata-dharma isdevotional service to the Lord in which the only objective is the satisfaction ofthe Lord. If one rejects this process and instead wants to hear about, teach ormeditate upon another process, the chance for immediate purification is lost.Neither ordinary materialistic yoga processes meant for achieving mysticpowers nor impersonal processes based on speculation have the power to purifyimmediately those who have fallen into sinful behavior. Sad-dharma, orbhägavata-dharma, pure devotional service to the Supreme Personality ofGodhead, is unique in that even the most fallen souls can immediately rise tothe highest perfectional stage by surrendering at the lotus feet of Kåñëa or Hispure devotee. This was vividly demonstrated in the preaching work ofCaitanya Mahäprabhu, especially in the case of the sinful brothers Jagäi and Mädhäi.</div>

<div class="First">The words itihäsam purätanam, meaning "ancient historical account," aresignificant here. Çrémad-Bhägavatam is nigama-kalpa-taror galitam phalam [SB1.1.3], the ripe fruit of the desire tree of Vedic knowledge. In the pages of theBhägavatam we find true historical narrations relating to the SupremePersonality of Godhead and the liberation of the conditioned souls. Thesehistorical accounts are not fiction or mythology, but describe the wonderfulactivities of the Lord and His devotees that took place in yugas previous to theadvent of this puny age. Although mundane scholars have foolishly tried todepict the Bhägavatam as a mythological work or a recent creation, the actualfact is that Çrémad-Bhägavatam is a perfect transcendental literature describingnot only the entire situation of this universe but also that which lies farbeyond this universe, in both the material and spiritual skies. If one seriouslystudies the Çrémad-Bhägavatam he becomes the most learned intellectual man.Caitanya Mahäprabhu desires that all pious persons become highly learned byhearing Çrémad-Bhägavatam and then preach the glories of the Lord in ascientific way all over the world. It is essential that we hear these historicalnarrations, such as the conversation between the nava-yogendras and KingVideha, with complete faith and submission. Then, as stated in verse 12 of thischapter, even if our former life is filled with abominable activities, simply byhearing Çrémad-Bhägavatam we shall be promoted to the same transcendentalstatus as the Lord and His pure devotees. This is the extraordinary power ofbhägavata history, as contrasted with useless, mundane historical accounts,which ultimately serve no purpose. Although mundane historians justify theirwork on the plea that we have to learn from history, we can practically seethat the world situation is now rapidly deteriorating into unbearable conflictand chaos while so-called historians stand helplessly by. But the bhägavatahistorians who have faithfully heard Çrémad-Bhägavatam can give perfect andpotent instructions for the restoration of a peaceful and blissful world.Therefore those who are inclined to enrich their intellectual life through thestudy of history should educate themselves in the historical narrations ofÇrémad-Bhägavatam. This will bring them the perfection of intellectual and spiritual life.</div>

<div class="Translation"> These sages wandered the earth seeing the entire universe, with all its gross and subtle objects, as a manifestation of the Supreme Lord and as nondifferent from the self.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, it is clearly demonstrated in this andthe following verse that the nine saintly sons of Åñabhadeva known as thenava-yogendras were situated in the highest stage of spiritual perfection, calledpäramahaàsya-caritam, or "having fully developed the character ofparamahaàsas." In other words, they were pure devotees of the Lord.According to Çrédhara Svämé and Jéva Gosvämé, the words ätmano 'vyatirekeëaindicate that the nine sages saw the universe as being nondifferent fromthemselves as well as nondifferent from the Supreme Soul, Lord Kåñëa.Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has additionally commented, ätmanaùparamätmanaù sakäçäd avyatirekeëa, viçvasya tac-chakti-mayatväd iti bhävaù:"Ätmanaù indicates the Supersoul. This universe is not different from theSupreme Personality of Godhead, Paramätmä, since the entire universe is composed of His energy."</div>
<div class="First">Although it is stated here that the cosmic manifestation is nondifferentfrom both the living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, oneshould not think that either the living entity or the Supreme Lord is material.A Vedic aphorism states, asaìgo hy ayaà puruñaù: "The living entity and theSupreme Personality of Godhead have nothing to do with the material world."Furthermore, Bhagavad-gétä says that the entire universe, consisting of eightgross and subtle elements, constitutes the bhinnä prakåti, or aparä prakåti—theseparated, inferior energy—of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. LordKåñëa clearly states in Bhagavad-gétä that He has eternally established His ownabode in the kingdom of God, where life is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge,and that the living entity, being part and parcel of God, is also eternal(mamaiväàço jéva-loke jéva-bhütaù sanätanaù [Bg. 15.7]). Furthermore, oncehaving gone to that eternal abode of the Lord the living entity never returnsto this temporary manifestation (yaà präpya na nivartante tad dhäma paramaà mama).</div>
<div class="First">One may therefore ask why the living entity and the Supreme Lord arestated to be nondifferent from the material universe. The question is verynicely answered by Çréla Närada Muni in the First Canto ofÇrémad-Bhägavatam (1.5.20). Idaà hi viçvaà bhagavän ivetaro yatojagat-sthäna-nirodha-sambhaväù: "The Supreme Lord Personality of Godheadis Himself this cosmos, and still He is aloof from it. From Him only has thiscosmic manifestation emanated, in Him it rests, and unto Him it enters afterannihilation." Commenting on Närada's statement, Çréla Prabhupäda has verynicely explained this delicate philosophical point: "For a pure devotee, theconception of Mukunda, Lord Çré Kåñëa, is both personal and impersonal. Theimpersonal cosmic situation is also Mukunda because it is the emanation of theenergy of Mukunda. For example, a tree is a complete unit, whereas the leavesand branches of the tree are emanated parts and parcels of the tree. The leavesand branches of the tree are also the tree, but the tree itself is neither theleaves nor the branches. The Vedic version that the whole cosmic creation isnothing but Brahman means that since everything is emanating from theSupreme Brahman, nothing is apart from Him. Similarly, the part-and-parcelhands and legs are called the body, but the body as the whole unit is neitherthe hands nor the legs. The Lord is the transcendental form of eternity,cognition and beauty. And thus the creation of the energy of the Lord appearsto be partially eternal, full of knowledge and beautiful also...."According to the Vedic version, the Lord is naturally fully powerful, andthus His supreme energies are always perfect and identical with Him. Both thespiritual and the material skies and their paraphernalia are emanations of theinternal and external energies of the Lord. External energy is comparativelyinferior, whereas the internal potency is superior. The superior energy is livingforce, and therefore she is completely identical [with the Lord], but theexternal energy, being inert, is partially identical. But both the energies areneither equal to nor greater than the Lord, who is the generator of all energies;such energies are always under His control, exactly as electrical energy,however powerful it may be, is always under the control of the engineer."The human being and all other living beings are products of His internalenergies. Thus the living being is also identical with the Lord. But he is never equal or superior to the Personality of Godhead."</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Prabhupäda has clearly explained here that both the cosmicmanifestation and the living entities are emanations from the Supreme Lord,as confirmed both in Vedanta-sutra and in the opening statement ofÇrémad-Bhägavatam. Janmädy asya yataù: [SB 1.1.1] "The Absolute Truth is thatfrom which everything emanates." Similarly, the Éçopaniñad states:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">oà pürëam adaù pürëam idaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">pürëät pürëam udacyate</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">pürëasya pürëam ädäya</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">pürëam evävaçiñyate</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">[Éço Invocation]</div>
<div class="First">The Supreme Lord, the Absolute Truth, is pürëa, or complete in Himself. Andsince this cosmic world is a manifestation of His potency, it also appears to bepürëa. In other words, because this material world is an emanation from theSupreme Lord, it is nondifferent from Him, exactly as the sun's rays arenondifferent from the sun globe, which is the source of their emanation.Similarly the living beings, who are expansions of the superior, or conscious,energy of the Supreme Lord, are also nondifferent from Kåñëa, although thisnondifference is qualitative and not quantitative. The gold found in goldenornaments such as rings and bracelets is qualitatively identical with the gold ina mine, but the gold in the mine is quantitatively far superior to the tinyquantity of gold in a bracelet or ring. Similarly, although we are qualitativelyone with God, being spiritual emanations of His unlimited potency, we arequantitatively infinitesimal and eternally subordinate to His supreme power.Therefore the Lord is called vibhu, or infinitely potent, and we are aëu, orinfinitesimal and dependent. This is further confirmed in the Vedic literatureby the statement nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm/ eko bahünäà yo vidadhätikämän (Kaöha Upaniñad 2.2.13). There are innumerable eternal living entitieswho are eternally and totally dependent upon the supreme singular livingentity, the Supreme Lord. That dependence is not an illusion created bymaterial existence, as stated by the impersonalist philosophers, but is aneternal relationship in which the Lord is eternally superior and we areeternally inferior. The Lord is eternally independent, and we are eternallydependent. The Lord is eternally absolute in Himself, and we are eternally relative to His supreme personality.</div>
<div class="First">Although the Lord is infinitely greater than any other living being, or thanall of them combined, every living being is qualitatively nondifferent from theLord, because all living beings are parts and parcels emanating from Him(mamaiväàço jéva-loke jéva-bhütaù sanätanaù [Bg. 15.7]). Therefore, in onesense, the living entity is also not different from the material cosmicmanifestation, which is an inferior sister energy of the Lord. Both the livingentity and the material nature are prakåti, or feminine, dependent expansionsof the supreme puruña. The difference is that the living entity is the superiorenergy of the Lord, because the living entity is conscious and eternal like theLord, whereas material energy is the inferior energy of the Lord, lacking consciousness and eternal form.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has emphasized in this regard thatthe absolute substance is one and is called Paramätmä, or the Supersoul. Whenone has achieved but a partial vision of the Paramätmä, one's understanding oflife is called ätma-darçana, or self-realization. And when even this partialunderstanding is lacking, one's existential condition is called anätma-darçana,or ignorance of the self. In the state of partial realization of the Supersoul,without recognition of the Paramätmä's distinction from the individual soul,the living entity tends to become puffed up by his spiritual achievement, becarried away by mental concoction, and consider himself equal in all respectswith God. On the other hand, the living entity situated in anätma-darçana, ormaterial ignorance, feels that he is completely different from the SupremeLord; and since everyone in this material world is interested in himself, theliving entity forgets about God, thinking that God is completely different fromhim and that there is therefore no substantial relationship between him andGod. In this way the impersonal transcendentalists emphasize only the onenessbetween God and the living entity, whereas the ordinary materialistsoveremphasize the difference between God and the living entity. But CaitanyaMahäprabhu has clearly revealed that the Ultimate Truth is simultaneousoneness and difference (acintya-bhedäbheda-tattva(89)). Actually we areeternally different from God. Because the living entity and God are eternallyseparate individual entities, there exists the possibility of an eternalrelationship. And because every living entity is qualitatively one with theSupreme Lord, that relationship constitutes the essence of the ultimate realityfor every living being. As stated in the Caitanya-caritämåta (Madhya 20.108),jévera 'svarüpa' haya-kåñëera 'nitya-däsa.' The ultimate essential identity ofevery living entity is his relationship with the Supreme Lord as a servitor of the Lord.</div>
<div class="First">If one can understand that he is an eternal servant of the SupremePersonality of Godhead, one can correctly understand that both the livingentity and the material universe are identical with Kåñëa, being emanationsfrom Him, and that they are therefore nondifferent from each other. ÇrélaBhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté has stated, "The material world is a manifestation ofsimultaneous difference and nondifference, and it is a form of the SupremeLord. Thus the temporary, perishable and ever-changing material world is different from Vaikuëöha, the eternal world."</div>
<div class="First">It should be noted that in this verse the word sad-asad-ätmakam, or "madeup of gross and subtle objects," does not refer to material and spiritual objects.This universe is stated to be composed of sat and asat, gross and subtle materialobjects. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté, "The very subtle statewithin the manifest world is known as 'the unmanifest,' and the realm beyondthe manifest world is called 'transcendental.' Within the coveringssurrounding the manifest, in the region of the time factor, is the phase ofmaterial existence experienced by the controlling deities; in this phase existthe two functions cause (asat) and effect (sat). In the universe, which is a thirdtattva, or reality (apart from and containing both sat and asat), and which is aform of the Supreme Lord, it is impossible to produce any contradiction to thenondual Absolute Truth." In other words, although ignorant, materialisticscientists may zealously carry out research to find a material principle that cannegate or render unnecessary the existence of God, Çréla BhaktisiddhäntaSarasvaté clearly states that since the universe is an emanation from the Lordand therefore spiritually identical with Him, there cannot possibly existanywhere within the universe a material law, principle or phenomenon that inany way contradicts the supremacy of the Personality of Godhead. In fact, theentire universe, along with the spiritual sky, exists as eternal testimony to theunlimited glory of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. With thisunderstanding, the nine Yogendras were traveling about the earth in transcendental bliss.</div>

<div class="First">Although impersonalist philosophers claim that every living entity is equalto God, they callously step over the heads of their so-called spiritual mastersand freely speculate on the nature of the Absolute, giving their own whimsicalopinions in defiance of the impersonal whims of their so-called gurus. In otherwords, although Mäyävädé impersonalists claim that everyone is God, theyultimately show an offensive mentality toward the Supreme Personality ofGodhead in rejecting the reality of His eternal form and pastimes. Thus, theyunwittingly belittle the eternal position of all living beings by denying theireternal personality and activities in the kingdom of God. The impersonalists,through their mental concoctions, try to minimize the position of the SupremePersonality of Godhead and the living entities who are part of Him, reducingthem theoretically to a formless, nameless light, which by their concoctionthey claim to be the Absolute God. The Vaiñëavas, however, welcome theSupreme Personality of Godhead and easily understand that the unlimitedSupreme Personality has nothing to do with the conditioned, limited,mundane personalities we find in the material world. The impersonalistsarrogantly assume that there could not be any transcendental or unlimitedpersonality beyond our present experience.

Now in thisverse the Supreme Personality of Godhead clearly explains that anyone whoknows Lord Kåñëa as the Supreme Person is actually the knower of everything.The imperfect knower goes on simply speculating about the Absolute Truth,but the perfect knower, without wasting his valuable time, engages directly inKåñëa consciousness, the devotional service of the Supreme Lord.... It is notthat one should simply speculate academically. One should submissively hearfrom Bhagavad-gétä that these living entities are always subordinate to theSupreme Personality of Godhead. Anyone who is able to understand this,according to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, knows thepurpose of the Vedas; no one else knows the purpose of the Vedas." Therefore,exalted devotees such as the nine Yogendras always accept the supremacy ofthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, as expressed here by the word näräyaëa-paräyaëän.</div>
<div class="First">King Nimi was a Vaiñëava, and therefore he worshiped the great sages withthe same respect with which he would worship the Supreme Personality ofGodhead, as shown by the word yathärhataù. Although impersonalists falselyclaim that every living entity is equal to God, they cannot properly respect anyliving being, because of their original offense at the lotus feet of the SupremePersonality. Their so-called worship, even of their own gurus, is ultimatelyself-serving and opportunistic. When an impersonalist imagines that he hasbecome God, he has no further need for his so-called guru. The Vaiñëava,however, because he accepts the supremacy of the eternal Personality ofGodhead, is ready and willing to offer eternal respect to all living beings,especially to those most fortunate living beings who have achieved shelter atthe lotus feet of the Lord. A Vaiñëava's worship of the Lord's representative isnot self-serving or opportunistic, but is an expression of eternal love for theLord and His representatives, as indicated here by the word prétaù. Thereforeit is clear from this verse that not only the nine exalted sons of Åñabhadevabut also King Nimi himself were all great devotees of the Supreme Personalityof Godhead, in defiance of the artificial and limited concept of impersonalism.</div>

<div class="First">Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has pointed out that the word sva-rucä indicates thatthe nava-yogendras glowed from their own spiritual effulgence and not due totheir ornaments or any other cause. The Supreme Soul, Lord Kåñëa, is theoriginal source of all light. His brilliantly glowing body is the source of theall-pervading brahmajyoti, the immeasurable spiritual light that is the restingplace of innumerable universes (yasya prabhä prabhavato jagad-aëòa-koöi [Bs.5.40]). The individual soul, being part and parcel of the Lord, is alsoself-effulgent. In fact, everything in the kingdom of God is self-effulgent, as described in Bhagavad-gétä (15.6):</div>

It is well known that the Supreme Personality of Godhead istranscendental to the three modes of material nature, as stated inBhagavad-gétä (7.13): mäm ebhyaù param avyayam. Similarly, His pure devoteesare also on the transcendental platform. One may ask how suchtranscendental living beings as the associates of Lord Viñëu could be seenwithin the material world. Therefore it is stated here, pävanäya caranti hi: theassociates of Lord Viñëu travel throughout the universe to reclaim the fallen,conditioned souls on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, the word dehinäm means bahavo dehäbhavanté yeñäà te, "the conditioned souls, who accept innumerable materialbodies." According to some wishful thinkers a living entity in the human formof life will never be degraded to a lower form such as that of an animal orplant. But despite this wishful thinking, it is a fact that according to ouractivities at the present, we will be elevated or degraded by the laws of God. Atthe present time in human society there is no clear or precise understanding ofthe nature of life. Foolish scientists have invented highly sophisticatedterminologies and theories to bluff innocent people into believing that lifecomes from chemical reactions. His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta SwamiPrabhupäda has exposed this bluff in his book Life Comes From Life, whichpoints out that although scientists claim that life comes from chemicals, theycannot produce so much as an insect, even from unlimited quantities ofchemicals. Actually, life and consciousness are symptoms of the spirit soul.In Life Comes From Life (page 43), Çréla Prabhupäda has stated, "Livingbeings move from one bodily form to another. The forms already exist. Theliving entity simply transfers himself, just as a man transfers himself from oneapartment to another. One apartment is first class, another is second class, andanother is third class. Suppose a person comes from a lower-class apartment toa first-class apartment. The person is the same. But now, according to hiscapacity for payment, or karma, he is able to occupy a higher-class apartment.Real evolution does not mean physical development, but development ofconsciousness." Within every species of life there is consciousness, and thatconsciousness is the symptom of the living entity, who is the superior energy ofthe Supreme Personality of Godhead. Without understanding this essentialpoint of the transmigration of the conscious living entity throughout8,400,000 species of life, one cannot possibly understand the words durlabhomänuño dehaù, "the human body is very rarely achieved."People are now being cheated of this essential understanding. They arecompletely unaware of the danger of slipping back into the eight millionspecies that lie below the human species. It is natural that a human beingthink in terms of progress. We want to feel that our life is progressing and thatwe are advancing and improving the quality of our life. Therefore, it is urgentthat people be informed of the great danger of misusing the valuable humanlife and that they know of the great opportunity the human life affords, theopportunity to take to Kåñëa consciousness. Just as on earth differentresidential areas are divided into high class, middle class and low class, withinthe universe there are upper-class, middle-class and lower-class planets. Bypractice of the yoga system, or by meticulous execution of religious rituals, onecan transfer himself to the higher planets within this universe. On the otherhand, by neglecting religious principles one will degrade himself to a lowerplanet. But the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, declares in Bhagavad-gétä (8.16),äbrahma-bhuvanäl lokäù punar ävartino 'rjuna. Thus the final conclusion isthat every planet within the material universe is an unsuitable andinappropriate residence, because on each planet there are the primal defectsold age and death. The Lord assures us, however, that in His transcendentalabode, which lies far beyond the material cosmos, life is everlasting, blissfuland absolutely cognizant. The material world is temporary, troublesome andrife with ignorance, but the spiritual world, called Vaikuëöha, is eternal, blissful and full of perfect knowledge.</div>
<div class="First">The highly evolved human brain is a gift given by God so that we may useour intelligence to distinguish between that which is eternal and that which is</div>

Learnedseers have concluded this by studying the nature of both."Those who have accepted the Supreme Lord and His abode as the ultimategoal of life are called vaikuëöha-priya. Here King Nimi states that to have thepersonal association of such learned transcendentalists is certainly theperfection of human life. In this connection Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta SarasvatéÖhäkura suggests that we consider the following verse:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nå-deham ädyaà su-labhaà su-durlabhaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">plavaà su-kalpaà guru-karëadhäram</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mayänukülena nabhasvateritaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">pumän bhaväbdhià na taret sa ätma-hä</div>
<div class="First">"[The Supreme Lord said:] The best of bodies, a human body, is a greatattainment, rarely achieved, and may be compared to a boat. The guru is anexpert captain for this boat, and I have sent favorable winds (the Vedas). ThusI have given all facilities for crossing over the ocean of material existence. Anyhuman being who has achieved these excellent facilities of human life but doesnot cross over the material ocean is to be considered the killer of his own self." (SB 11.20.17)</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté, the eternal servants of theSupreme Lord, being controlled by powerful feelings of mercy, descend intothe material world as Vaiñëavas to deliver the conditioned souls who arebound by the results of their own mundane work. Such Vaiñëavas alsodistribute their mercy to those who are laboriously searching after theimpersonal Absolute. Çré Närada Muni has stated that without ecstatic love ofGodhead such laborious, impersonal contemplation of the Absolute iscertainly troublesome (naiñkarmyam apy acyuta-bhäva-varjitam), and what tospeak of the innumerable problems of ordinary gross materialistic life. Wehave practical experience that in the Western countries most people areworking hard to get money, laboring under heavenly dreams of sensegratification. Others, having become frustrated with ordinary materialistic life,are trying to negate their personal existence and merge into the existence ofGod through so-called yoga and meditation. Both classes of unhappy people arereceiving the mercy of the Kåñëa consciousness movement, putting aside theirdreams of sense gratification as well as their troublesome impersonalspeculation. They are learning to chant the holy names of God, dance inecstasy, and feast on the holy food offered to the Lord. They become enlivenedby the transcendental knowledge spoken by the Lord Himself in theBhagavad-gétä. As the Lord states in Bhagavad-gétä (9.2), susukhaà kartumavyayam. The actual process of spiritual freedom is joyful to perform and hasnothing to do with fruitive activities aimed at sense gratification or with dryimpersonal speculation. More and more people are taking to the process ofKåñëa consciousness, becoming joyful, and eagerly distributing Kåñëa's mercyto others. Thus the whole world will be enlivened and inspired by the Kåñëaconsciousness movement, which is the practical demonstration of the mercy of the Vaiñëavas.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Therefore, O completely sinless ones, I ask you to kindly tell me what the supreme good is. After all, even half a moment's association with pure devotees within this world of birth and death is a priceless treasure for any man.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The word çevadhiù, or "a great treasure," is significant in this verse. Just asan ordinary man is overjoyed to discover an unexpected treasure, one who isactually intelligent is overjoyed to gain the association of a pure devotee of theLord, by which one's life can easily be perfected. According to Çréla JévaGosvämé the words ätyantikaà kñemam, or "the supreme good," indicate thatsituation in which one cannot be touched by even the slightest fear. Now weare entangled in the cycle of birth, old age, disease and death (saàsäre).Because our entire situation can be devastated in a single moment, we areconstantly in fear. But the pure devotees of the Lord can teach us the practicalway to free ourselves from material existence and thus to abolish all types of fear.</div>
<div class="First">According to Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, normal etiquette woulddictate that a host immediately ask a guest who has arrived about hiswell-being. But such an inquiry is unsuitable to place before self-satisfieddevotees of the Lord, who are themselves the bestowers of all well-being.According to Çréla Viçvanätha, the King knew that it would be useless to askthe sages about their business affairs, since the only business of the puredevotees of the Lord is the achievement of the supreme goal of life. Accordingto Bhagavad-gétä, the goal of life is to free oneself from the cycle of birth anddeath and reinstate oneself as an eternal servant of God on the platform ofspiritual bliss. Pure devotees of the Lord do not waste their time with ordinarymundane affairs. Sometimes foolish relatives of a Vaiñëava preacher lamentthat such a transcendental preacher has not used his life for material businessand that so much money has therefore been lost by the practice of spirituallife. Such ignorant persons cannot imagine the unlimited prosperity availableon the spiritual platform to those who have surrendered heart and soul to themission of the Lord. King Nimi was himself a learned Vaiñëava, and thereforehe did not foolishly ask the sages about ordinary worldly affairs. Heimmediately inquired about ätyantikaà kñemam, the highest, most perfect goal of life.</div>
<div class="First">According to Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the word anaghäù, "O sinlessones," has two meanings. Anaghäù indicates that the nine Yogendras werethemselves completely free of sins. It also indicates that merely by the greatfortune of seeing them and hearing from them submissively, an ordinary, sinfulman could also be freed of his sins and achieve everything he desired.One might object that since the great sages had just arrived, the Kingshould not have been so impatient as to inquire from them about theperfection of life. Perhaps the King should have waited until the sagesthemselves invited his inquiry. Such a hypothetical objection is answered bythe words kñaëärdho pi. Even a single moment's association with pure devotees,or even half a moment's association, is sufficient to give one the perfection oflife. An ordinary person who is offered a great treasure will immediately desireto claim such a treasure. Similarly, King Nimi was thinking, "Why should Iconsider myself fortunate enough to have such great sages stay here for a longtime? Because I am an ordinary person, undoubtedly you will soon be leaving.Therefore, let me immediately take advantage of your holy association."According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté, in this world there aredifferent varieties of mercy. But ordinary mercy cannot bring about thecessation of all unhappiness. In other words, there are many humanitarians,altruists and social reformers who certainly work for the betterment ofhumanity. Such persons are universally considered merciful. But in spite oftheir mercy, humanity continues to suffer in the grip of birth, old age, diseaseand death. I may distribute free food to the needy, but even after eating mymerciful gift, the recipient will again become hungry, or he will suffer in someother way. In other words, by mere humanitarianism or altruism, people do notactually become free from unhappiness. Their unhappiness is merelypostponed or altered. King Nimi was joyful upon seeing the nava-yogendrasbecause he knew that they were eternally perfect associates of the SupremeLord. Therefore he thought, "You are not prone to sinful activities likeunfortunate mundane people such as me. Thus the words you speak carry no deception or exploitation."</div>
<div class="First">The materially conditioned souls spend their days and nights discussingvarious topics of sense gratification. They never find time to hear abouttranscendental knowledge. But if even only briefly or accidentally they hearhari-kathä, topics of Kåñëa, in the association of pure devotees of the Lord,their propensity to suffer in material existence will slacken. When one seesliberated persons, hears about Kåñëa from them, remembers their saintlybehavior and so on, one's tendency to bind himself in the illusion of sensegratification is diminished, and he becomes eager to serve the Supreme Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Within the material world there are two classes of mundane philosopherswho present their opinions about the Supreme Lord. Some so-calledtheologians claim that we are infinitely different from God, and therefore theytend to look upon the Lord as something far beyond our power to understand.Such extreme dualistic philosophers outwardly or officially claim to be piousand religious believers in God, but they consider God so much different fromthat which is within our experience that according to them there is little profitin even trying to discuss the personality or attributes of the Supreme Lord.Such outwardly faithful persons generally take to fruitive activities and grossmaterialistic sense gratification, being infatuated with the mundanerelationships of the material world, which appear under the headings society, friendship and love.</div>
<div class="First">The advaita-vädés, or nondualistic philosophers, claim that there is nodifference between God and the living entity and that the highest goal of lifeis to give up our personal existence, which is due to illusion, and merge intothe impersonal Brahman effulgence, which is devoid of name, form,paraphernalia and personality. Thus neither class of speculative philosopher isable to understand the transcendental Personality of Godhead. Caitanya Mahäprabhu, in His sublime teaching of</div>
<div class="First">acintya-bhedäbhedha-tattva, or simultaneous oneness and difference, has clearlydemonstrated that we are qualitatively one with God but quantitativelydifferent. God is personal consciousness, and He has His personal form.Similarly we are also personal consciousness, and ultimately, when liberated,we also have eternal forms. The difference is that the eternal form andpersonality of the Supreme Lord contain unlimited potency and opulencewhereas our potency and opulence are infinitesimal. We are conscious of ourpersonal body, whereas Lord Kåñëa, the Absolute Truth, is conscious ofeveryone's body, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä (kñetra-jïaà cäpi mäà viddhisarva-kñetreñu bhärata [Bg. 13.3]). But although God is infinitely greater thanthe living entity, both God and the living entities are eternal personalities with form, activities and feelings.</div>
<div class="First">The Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, expands Himself into innumerable livingentities to enjoy rasas, or ecstatic relationships, with them. The living entitiesare part and parcel of Lord Kåñëa, and they are meant to serve Him with love.Although the Supreme Lord is eternally the predominator and the livingentity is eternally the predominated, when the living entity surrenders untothe Lord with a sincere loving attitude, desiring to serve the Lord eternallywithout the slightest expectation of personal reward for such service, the Lordimmediately is pleased, as expressed here by the word prasannaù. Kåñëa, theSupreme Personality of Godhead, is so unlimitedly merciful and magnanimousthat in His gratitude to such a surrendered and loving servitor, He isimmediately inclined to offer anything, even Himself, to His surrendered devotee.</div>
<div class="First">There are numerous practical, historical examples of this loving propensityof the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because of the love of Mother Yaçodä,child Kåñëa, in His form as Dämodara, surrendered Himself to His lovingmother and allowed Himself to be bound with ropes as a childhoodpunishment. Similarly, feeling indebted to the Päëòavas for their intense lovefor Him, Kåñëa in His form as Pärtha-särathi happily agreed to drive thechariot of Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra. Similarly, Kåñëa inVåndävana is always thinking of ways to satisfy the gopés, who are universallyrecognized as the most exalted loving devotees of the Lord.Such intense loving feelings exchanged between the Lord and His puredevotees would not be possible were the living entities not qualitatively onewith the Supreme Personality of Godhead and indeed inseparable parts andparcels of the Lord. On the other hand, because both the Supreme Personalityof Godhead and the living entities are eternally individuals, each with his owneternal individual consciousness, such loving exchanges are a perpetual realityin the kingdom of God. In other words, absolute oneness with God andabsolute difference from God are theoretical imaginations of different schoolsof speculative philosophy. The perfection of spiritual love, as described in thisverse, is based on simultaneous oneness and difference, and this absolutereality was elaborately presented by Lord Kåñëa Himself in His brahminicalincarnation as Caitanya Mahäprabhu. The followers of Caitanya Mahäprabhuhave expounded this perfect doctrine in innumerable books, culminating inthe teachings of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda,who has most perfectly presented this knowledge in a way that isunderstandable not only in India but to all the people of the world. Ourpresent insignificant attempt is simply to complete his translation andcommentary on Çrémad-Bhägavatam, and we are constantly praying for hisguidance so that this work can simply be completed exactly as he would havedesired. If one can understand these teachings of Caitanya Mahäprabhu asthey are being presented in Western languages, surely the Lord will be satisfied with such a sincere seeker of spiritual truth.</div>

<div class="First">In the opinion of Çréla Çrédhara Svämé the word asad-ätma-bhävät in thisverse indicates that the living entity is constantly disturbed by fear because heidentifies his eternal self with the temporary material body and itsparaphernalia. Similarly, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has stated,bhakti-pratiküla-deha-gehädiñv äsaktim. Because of one's attachment to one'stemporary body and so-called home, family, friends and so on, one'sintelligence is always disturbed by fear, and one is unable to appreciate orpractice pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord. So-called religiousactivities executed in the bodily conception of life are always accompanied byfear and anxiety about the ultimate result. But pure devotional service to theSupreme Personality of Godhead frees one from fear and anxiety because it isexecuted on the platform of Vaikuëöha, or the spiritual plane, where there isno fear or anxiety. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the process of bhakti-yogais so powerful that even in the stage of sädhana-bhakti, in which one ispracticing devotional service through rules and regulations, the neophyte canhave a direct experience of fearlessness by the mercy of the Lord. As one'sdevotional service becomes mature, the Lord reveals Himself to the devotee, and all fear is totally vanquished forever.</div>
<div class="First">Every living entity has a natural propensity to serve God, but because offalse identification with the temporary body one loses touch with this pure,constitutional propensity and instead inauspiciously becomes attached totemporary sense gratification in the form of body, home, family and so on. Theresult of such false attachment is continuing distress, which can be eradicated only by devotional service to the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="First">In this connection, Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté has quoted the following verse:</div>

<div class="Translation"> Even ignorant living entities can very easily come to know the Supreme Lord if they adopt those means prescribed by the Supreme Lord Himself. The process recommended by the Lord is to be known as bhägavata-dharma, or devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">There are many Vedic scriptures, such as Manu-saàhitä, that presentstandard injunctions for the peaceful management of human society. SuchVedic knowledge is based on the varëäçrama system, which scientificallydivides human society into four occupational divisions as well as four spiritualdivisions. According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, however, knowledge that canbring one directly in contact with the Supreme Personality of Godhead iscalled ati-rahasyam, or the most confidential knowledge (ati-rahasyatvätsva-mukhenaiva bhagavatäviduñäm api puàsäm aïjaù sukhenaivätma-labdhaye).Bhägavata-dharma is so confidential that it is spoken by the Lord Himself.The essence of bhägavata-dharma is given in Bhagavad-gétä, wherein Kåñëapersonally instructs Arjuna. Yet in the Eleventh Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatamthe Lord will give instructions to Uddhava that surpass even the teachingsgiven to Arjuna in Bhagavad-gétä. As Çréla Prabhupäda has stated,"Undoubtedly Bhagavad-gétä was spoken by the Lord on the Battlefield ofKurukñetra just to encourage Arjuna to fight, and yet to complete thetranscendental knowledge of Bhagavad-gétä the Lord instructed Uddhava. TheLord wanted Uddhava to fulfill His mission and disseminate knowledge whichHe had not spoken even in Bhagavad-gétä." (SB 3.4.32 purport) Similarly, it isunderstood that the knowledge that will be presented here by the nineYogendras is not their personal concoction but is authorized knowledge originally spoken by the Lord Himself.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté, the living entities, in thecourse of their wanderings throughout the cycle of birth and death, lose alltrace of the Personality of Godhead. But when they hear the eternallyauspicious topics spoken by the Supreme Lord for their benefit and understandtheir eternal identities as spirit souls, the realized experience of being aneternal servant of Kåñëa becomes the basis of bhägavata-dharma. In the soul'sexperience as a pure Vaiñëava, or servant of God, there is no consideration ofbeing different from God or the same as God, nor is one interested in thekingdom of material sense gratification. The pure devotee simply perceives hisparticular devotional service to the Supreme Lord and sees himself as anindividual part and parcel of the ultimate shelter. A pure devotee experiencesthat his very being is tied, by ropes of loving devotion, to the ultimate shelterHimself in one of His direct personal expansions. And in such a perfect stateof consciousness, the devotee can perceive the all-pervading variegated forms of the Absolute Truth.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, the word aïjaù ("easily"), which is usedin the previous verse, is explained in this verse. He states, aïjaù-padenoktaàsu-karatvaà vivåëoti: "By the word aïjaù the ease of performing bhakti-yoga isestablished, and this will be elaborated in the present verse." In Bhagavad-gétä(9.2) the Lord Himself states, pratyakñävagamaà dharmyaà susukhaà kartumavyayam: "The process of devotional service to the Supreme Personality ofGodhead is eternal, and it is very joyfully and naturally performed." ÇrélaPrabhupäda comments, "The process of devotional service is a very happy one.Why? Devotional service consists of çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù [SB 7.5.23], soone can simply hear the chanting of the glories of the Lord or can attendphilosophical lectures on transcendental knowledge given by authorizedäcäryas. Simply by sitting, one can learn; then one can eat the remnants of thefood offered to God, nice palatable dishes. In every state devotional service isjoyful. One can execute devotional service even in the most poverty-strickencondition. The Lord says, patraà puñpaà phalam: He is ready to accept fromthe devotee any kind of offering, never mind what. Even a leaf, a flower, a bitof fruit or a little water, which are all available in every part of the world, canbe offered by any person, regardless of social position, and will be accepted ifoffered with love. There are many instances of this in history. Simply bytasting the tulasé leaves offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, great sages likeSanat-kumära became great devotees. Therefore the devotional process is verynice, and it can be executed in a happy mood. God accepts only the love with which things are offered to Him."</div>
<div class="First">The essential point to be understood here is that when a living entitysurrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he tells the Lord, "My dearLord, although I am most sinful and unqualified and for so long have beentrying to forget You, now I am taking shelter at Your lotus feet. From this dayon I am Yours. Whatever I possess—my body, mind, words, family, riches—Iam now offering at Your lotus feet. Please do with me as You like." TheSupreme Lord, Kåñëa, has repeatedly given assurance in Bhagavad-gétä that Hewill protect and redeem such a surrendered living entity, bringing him backhome, back to Godhead, for an eternal life in the Lord's own kingdom. Thusthe qualification of surrendering to the Lord is so great and spiritually potentthat even if a surrendered soul is deficient in other aspects of pious life, hiselevated status is protected by the Lord Himself. In other processes, however,such as yoga, because one depends upon his own determination andintelligence and does not actually seek shelter of the Lord, one is subject to fallat any moment, being protected only by one's own flimsy, limited potency.Therefore, as stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (10.2.32), äruhya kåcchreëa paraàpadaà tataù/ patanty adho 'nädåta-yuñmad-aìghrayaù: if one gives up theshelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord and instead tries to advance inthe yoga process by one's own determination, or if one tries to make progress inknowledge by one's own speculative power, surely one will eventually fall againto a mediocre material platform, having no protection other than one's ownfallible strength. Therefore the Vaiñëava äcäryas, in their commentaries onthis verse, have illustrated in various ways the vast superiority of bhakti-yoga,or pure devotional service. In this connection, Çrédhara Svämé states, nimélyanetre dhävann api iha eñu bhägavata-dharmeñu na skhalet. nimélanaànämäjïänaà, yathähuù-'çruti-småté ubhe netre vipräëäà parikértite/ ekenavikalaù käëo dväbhyäm andhaù prakértitaù' iti. "Even if running with both eyesclosed, a devotee on this path of bhägavata-dharma will not stumble. 'Closingone's eyes' refers to being in ignorance [of standard Vedic literatures]. As it issaid, 'The çruti and småti scriptures are the two eyes of the brähmaëas. Lackingone of them, a brähmaëa is half blind, and deprived of both he is considered completely blind.' "</div>
<div class="First">In Bhagavad-gétä (10.10-11) the Lord has clearly stated that even if a devoteeis lacking in Vedic knowledge or ignorant of Vaiñëava literature, the Lordpersonally enlightens him from within his heart if the devotee is actuallyengaged in loving service to the Lord. In this connection, Çréla Prabhupädastates, "When Lord Caitanya was in Benares promulgating the chanting ofHare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma,Räma Räma, Hare Hare, thousands of people were following Him.Prakäçänanda, a very influential and learned scholar in Benares at that time,derided Lord Caitanya for being a sentimentalist. Sometimes philosopherscriticize the devotees because they think that most of the devotees are in thedarkness of ignorance and are philosophically naive sentimentalists. Actuallythat is not the fact. There are very, very learned scholars who have putforward the philosophy of devotion, but even if a devotee does not takeadvantage of their literatures or of his spiritual master, if he is sincere in hisdevotional service he is helped by Kåñëa Himself within his heart. So thesincere devotee engaged in Kåñëa consciousness cannot be without knowledge.The only qualification is that one carry out devotional service in full Kåñëa consciousness."</div>
<div class="First">Yet this facility given by the Lord cannot justify unauthorized concoctionsput forward about the process of devotional service in the name ofspontaneous devotion. In this connection Çréla Viçvanätha CakravartéÖhäkura has stated, bhagavat-präpty-arthaà påthäì-märga-karaëaà tvati-düñaëävaham eva: "If one manufactures his own process of devotionalservice for the sake of attaining the Supreme Lord, such a concoction willcause total ruination." Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura goes on to quote:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">çruti-småti-puräëädipaïcarätra-</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">vidhià vinä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">aikäntiké harer bhaktir</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">utpätäyaiva kalpate</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">[Brs. 1.2.101(90)]</div>
<div class="First">"If one's so-called unalloyed devotion to Lord Hari does not take into accountthe regulations of the çruti, småti, Puräëas and Païcarätra, it is nothing morethan a disturbance to society." In other words, even if one is not learned in theVedic literatures, if he is engaged in the loving service of the Lord he is to beaccepted as a pure devotee; nonetheless, such loving devotion cannot in anyway contradict the injunctions of revealed scriptures.Such groups as the präkåta-sahajiyäs ignore the standard regulations ofVaiñëava dharma and engage in illicit, degraded activities, dressing as Rädhäand Kåñëa in the name of spontaneous devotion. They claim that because suchspontaneous devotion is revealed by the Lord Himself, they need not refer tostandard scriptures. Similarly, all over the world there are pseudoreligionistswho manufacture their own processes and claim they are receiving knowledgefrom the Lord Himself within their hearts. Therefore it is very important tounderstand, as stated here, that spontaneous revelation by the Lord within theheart is meant not to alter the eternal process of devotional service to theLord, but to give a supplementary facility to a sincere devotee who is ignorantof revealed scriptures. In other words, the revealed scriptures describe theeternal process of service to the Lord. Since the Lord is eternal and the livingentity is eternal, the process of their loving relationship is also eternal. TheLord never changes His essential nature, nor does the living entity. Thereforethere is no need to change the essential process of loving service to the Lord.Special revelation by the Lord is meant to give scriptural knowledge byanother means, and not to contradict scriptural knowledge.On the other hand, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has stated that ifa devotee is executing all the basic principles of bhakti-yoga and advancing indevotional service, such a Vaiñëava should not be criticized for neglecting thesecondary procedures. For example, His Divine Grace A.C. BhaktivedantaSwami Prabhupäda established hundreds of spiritual communities in theWestern countries for practicing Kåñëa consciousness. The devotees in thesecommunities give up all illicit sex, gambling, intoxication and meat-eating andconstantly engage in service to Kåñëa. Such followers of Çréla Prabhupäda areable to make wonderful spiritual advancement and convert many thousands ofpeople to the process of devotional service. In fact, all the faithful members ofISKCON who follow the standard regulations remain free from materialcontamination and make visible progress in going back home, back toGodhead. Such members of ISKCON cannot possibly execute all the details ofthe varëäçrama-dharma system. In fact, many Western devotees can barelypronounce Sanskrit words and are not very expert in performing elaboratesacrifices based on chanting of mantras and offering of oblations. But becausethey are executing all the essential principles of bhakti-yoga by giving upmaterial sense gratification and constantly engaging in loving service to Kåñëa,their position is guaranteed both in this life and in the next.We have seen many sophisticated Sanskrit scholars and learned experts inthe details of Vedic sacrifice who can hardly even follow the basic principles ofhuman life, namely no illicit sex, no meat-eating, no gambling and nointoxication. Such brilliant scholars and ritualistic performers are generallyseen to be attached to a materialistic conception of life and are fond of mentalspeculation. Although in Bhagavad-gétä the Lord Himself has given perfectknowledge for all time, such so-called scholars consider themselves moreintelligent than the Lord and thus speculate on the meaning of Vedicliterature. Such speculation certainly constitutes a fall from perfect spirituallife, and what then is to be said of materialistic fruitive activities, which areillusory in every sense of the term. The transcendental devotees are able toremain aloof from the pollution of fruitive activity and mental speculation, and that is the essential purport of this verse.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has warned that the words yänästhäya indicate that the exalted status of a Vaiñëava can never be accorded toone who is not following the basic regulations of bhakti-yoga. Nor can it applyto one who is sometimes serving Kåñëa and sometimes serving the illusoryenergy, mäyä, by mental speculation or fruitive activities. ÇrélaBhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has concluded, "In all dharmas other thanbhägavata-dharma one must consider the conditioned soul's qualification. But asoul surrendered to the Lord is never confounded by error, even if unqualifiedin all other respects. His feet never stumble, and he never falls. Even thoughwandering in the world at whim, he always resides in an auspicious place bythe influence of his unswerving worship. The unique potency ofbhagavata-dharma does not appear in any of the other dharmas of the world.There is no comparison between a surrendered individual who has takenshelter of bhägavata-dharma and the practitioner of any other dharma."</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has commented in this regard thata person who engages all the sensory activities of his body, mind, words,intelligence, ego and consciousness in the service of the Supreme Lord cannotbe considered to be on the same level as a karmé working for his personal sensegratification. Although apparently still a conditioned soul, one who offers thefruits of all his activities to the Lord can no longer be touched by the countlessmiseries that arise from the reactions to materialistic activities.Because of enmity against the Supreme Personality of Godhead and Hisomnipotent authority, the conditioned living entity performs activities againstthe order of the Lord. Yet self-realized souls continue to perform all types ofwork within this world to carry out the mission of the Supreme Lord.According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, those karmés who aresufficiently pious follow the example of the self-realized souls by trying to offerthe fruits of their own duties at the lotus feet of the Lord. Although this iscounted as karma-miçrä bhakti, or devotional service mixed with the desire toexecute fruitive activities, such mixed devotional service is graduallytransformed into pure devotional service. As the pious fruitive workersdisengage themselves, step by step, from the bogus philosophy of "enjoyment ofone's hard-earned rewards," pure devotional service rewards them with complete good fortune.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has commented, ätmanä cittenähaìkäreëa vä anusåtoyaù svabhävas tasmät: although one may still be in the bodily concept of life,he should offer the fruit of his work to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Those with a primitive, materialistic concept of the Supreme Lord considerthe Lord present only in a temple or church. They make some offering to theLord in the place of worship, but in their normal activities they claimproprietorship, not thinking that God is present everywhere and withineveryone. We have practical experience of many so-called religious men whobecome very offended if their children try to become servants of the SupremeLord. They feel, "God should be pleased with whatever humble offering I giveHim, but my family and ordinary business affairs belong to me and are undermy control." The perception of anything as separate from the SupremePersonality of Godhead or His proprietorship is called mäyä, or illusion. ÇrélaÇrédhara Svämé has quoted, na kevalaà vidhitaù kåtam eveti niyamaù;svabhävänusäri laukikam api: "The regulation that one should serve theSupreme Lord does not refer only to prescribed religious paths, ceremonies andregulations; rather, all the activities one performs in this world according toone's personal nature should be dedicated to the Supreme Personality of Godhead."</div>
<div class="First">The words karoti yad yat sakalaà parasmai näräyaëäyeti samarpayet tat inthis verse are very significant. A similar verse is found in Bhagavad-gétä (9.27):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yat karoñi yad açnäsi</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yaj juhoñi dadäsi yat</div>

<div class="First">"O son of Kunté, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and giveaway, and all the austerities that you perform should be done as an offeringunto Me." The objection may be raised, Since our ordinary activities areperformed with a material body and material mind, not by the spirit soul, howcan such activities be offered to the Supreme Lord, who is completelytranscendental to the material world? How can such activities be consideredspiritual? In answer to this it is stated in the Viñëu Puräëa (3.8.8):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">varëäçramäcära-vatä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">puruñeëa paraù pumän</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">viñëur ärädhyate panthä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nänyat tat-toña-käraëam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">[Cc. Madhya 8.58]</div>
<div class="First">One who wants to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu, mustaccept the system of varëäçrama-dharma and worship the Lord through theexecution of his prescribed duties. In Bhagavad-gétä (4.13) the Supreme Lordhas personally taken credit for establishing the system of varëäçrama-dharma:cätur-varëyaà mayä såñöaà guëa-karma-vibhägaçaù. Therefore if one offers hiswork within the varëäçrama-dharma system to the Supreme Lord, such work iscounted as devotional service. According to one's svabhäva, or nature, one maywork as an intellectual or priest, as an administrator or military man, as anagriculturist or mercantile man, or as a laborer or craftsman. And whileworking, everyone should meditate on the Supreme Personality of Godhead,thinking, yat sakalaà parasmai näräyaëäya: "I am working for the SupremeLord. Whatever result comes from my work, I shall accept the bare minimumfor my personal maintenance, and the rest I shall offer for the glorification of Lord Näräyaëa."</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has pointed out, käminäà tu sarvathaiva naduñkarmärpaëam: one cannot offer duñkarma, or sinful, wicked activities, tothe Supreme Personality of Godhead. The four pillars of sinful life are illicitsex, meat-eating, gambling and intoxication. Such activities are neveracceptable as offerings to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The examplemay be given that although in a free society each person is allowed to choosehis own occupation, even a democratic government will not allow a citizen tochoose the occupation of thief or murderer. In the same way, according to thelaws of God one is invited to work according to his own nature in thevarëäçrama system, but one is forbidden to adopt a criminal life of sinful activities violating the laws of God.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has given a nice description of howone should offer one's ordinary activities to the Supreme Lord. He says that anordinary sense gratifier begins his activities in the morning by passing stooland urine, cleaning his mouth, brushing his teeth, bathing, meeting his friendsand family members and discussing with them the day's business. In this wayone has so many activities during the day, and a sense gratifier executes allthese activities for his personal material enjoyment. A karmé, on the otherhand, working under the jurisdiction of the karma-käëòa section of the Vedas,will perform the same activities for the pleasure of the demigods and hisforefathers. Thus, according to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, adevotee of the Supreme Lord, Näräyaëa, should similarly perform all of hisdaily activities for the pleasure of the Supreme Lord. In this way everything wedo throughout the day will become bhakty-aìga, or a supplementary aspect of our devotional service to Kåñëa.</div>
<div class="First">It should be understood that as long as one identifies oneself in terms of thevarëäçrama-dharma system rather than as part and parcel of Kåñëa one is stillon the platform of ahaìkära, or false ego, because the varëäçrama system isdesigned according to the modes of nature acquired by the living entitythrough his material body. But the äcäryas have emphasized in theircommentaries on this verse that such a false ego, by which one identifiesoneself as a brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya, çüdra, sannyäsé, gåhastha and so on,should also be offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, when one becomes very much attracted tohearing and chanting about the Supreme Lord and not merely offering Himthe fruits of one's work, one has attained the stage called svarüpa-siddhä bhakti,or the stage in which actual devotion becomes visible. The example may begiven that although any good citizen will pay his taxes to the government, hemay not necessarily love the government or its leaders. Similarly a pious livingentity can understand that he is working under the laws of God, and thereforein accordance with Vedic injunctions or the injunctions of other scriptures heoffers a portion of his assets to the Supreme Lord in religious ceremonies. Butwhen such a pious person actually becomes attached to chanting and hearingabout the personal qualities of the Lord and when love thus becomes visible,he is considered to be reaching the mature stage of life. In this regard, ÇrélaJéva Gosvämé has quoted several verses that very nicely show the developmentof love for Godhead. Anena durväsanä-duùkha-darçanena sa karuëä-mayaùkaruëäà karotu: "May the merciful Lord show mercy on me by demonstratingthe misery created by sinful desires." Yä prétir avivekänäà visayeñv anapäyiné/tväm anusmarataù sä me hådayän näpasarpatu: "Unintelligent persons haveunflinching affection for the objects of sense gratification. Similarly, may Ialways remember You, so that that same attachment, applied to You, neverleaves my heart." (Viñëu Puräëa 1.20.19) Yuvaténäà yathä yüni yünäà cayuvatau yathä/ mano 'bhiramate tadvan mano me ramatäà tvayi: "As the mindsof young girls take pleasure in thinking of a young boy and those of young boystake pleasure in thinking of a young girl, may my mind take pleasure in You."Mama sukarmaëi duñkarmaëi ca yad räga-sämänyam, tad sarvato-bhävenabhagavad-viñayam eva bhavatu: "Whatever attraction I have for pious or sinfulactivities, let that attraction be wholeheartedly invested in You."</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Fear arises when a living entity misidentifies himself as the material body because of absorption in the external, illusory energy of the Lord. When the living entity thus turns away from the Supreme Lord, he also forgets his own constitutional position as a servant of the Lord. This bewildering, fearful condition is effected by the potency for illusion, called mäyä. Therefore, an intelligent person should engage unflinchingly in the unalloyed devotional service of the Lord, under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, whom he should accept as his worshipable deity and as his very life and soul.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé the objection may be raised that sincefear is caused by ignorance, it can be dispelled by knowledge and there is noneed to worship the Supreme Lord. The living entity falsely identifies with hismaterial body, family, society and so on, and he simply has to give up this false identification. Then what will mäyä be able to do?</div>
<div class="First">In reply to this argument, Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has quoted the following verse from Bhagavad-gétä (7.14):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">daivé hy eñä guëa-mayé</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mama mäyä duratyayä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mäm eva ye prapadyante</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mäyäm etäà taranti te</div>
<div class="First">"This divine energy of Mine consisting of the three modes of material nature isdifficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easilycross beyond it." The living entity, called jéva-tattva, is one of the potencies ofthe Supreme Lord, but the constitutional position of the living entity istaöa-stha, or marginal. Being minute, every living entity is eternally dependentupon the supreme living entity, Kåñëa. This is confirmed in the Vedicliterature as follows: nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäà/ eko bahünäà yovidadhäti kämän. "Among all the eternally conscious beings there is onesupreme eternal living being who is supplying the needs of all the innumerableothers." (Kaöha Upaniñad 2.1.12) Kåñëadäsa Kaviräja has stated, ekale éçvarakåñëa, ära saba bhåtya: "Kåñëa is the only independent controller; all otherliving entities depend upon Him." (Cc. Ädi 5.142) Just as the finger is part andparcel of the body and therefore must always be engaged in bodily service, weas parts and parcels of Kåñëa (mamaiväàço jéva-loke jéva-bhütaù sanätanaù [Bg.15.7]) have the eternal duty (sanätana-dharma) of engaging in the unalloyed service of the Lord.</div>
<div class="First">The potency of the Lord that enlightens us in the Lord's service is calledcit-çakti. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura comments that when theliving entity develops a spirit of independence he is forced to come to thematerial world, where he enters into various types of petty and undesirablebehavior that create a fearful situation for him. The bahiraìgä-çakti, theillusory potency of the Supreme Lord, covers all trace of the cit-çakti andimposes one material body after another upon the living entity for his grosssinful enjoyment. As further punishment, the living entity who has given uphis loving relationship with Kåñëa loses all power to perceive the eternal,blissful form of the Supreme Lord, who is his actual shelter. Instead the livingentity becomes attached to many temporary, phantasmagorical forms, such ashis personal body, the bodies of his family members and friends, his nation, hiscity, with its buildings and cars, and innumerable types of ephemeral materialscenery. In such a state of gross ignorance the idea of returning to one's original identity no longer even crosses the mind.</div>
<div class="First">By the laws of God the three modes of material nature are constantly inconflict, as stated in the Bhagavad-gétä. This conflict is described in manyplaces in the Bhägavatam as guëa-vyatikaram. When the living entity isbewildered by the interactions of the modes of material nature, he comes tothe conclusion of relativity and assumes that God and worship of God aresimply by-products of the relative, contradictory interactions of nature'smodes. In the name of anthropological, sociological or psychologicalperspective, the living entity falls deeper and deeper into the darkness ofmaterialistic ignorance, dedicating himself to mundane piety, economicdevelopment, sense gratification, or speculation in which he regards theAbsolute as lacking variety and personality, which he assumes to be products of the interactions of nature's modes.</div>
<div class="First">The illusory potency of the Supreme Lord is duratyayä; it is impossible toescape without the direct mercy of Kåñëa (mäm eva ye prapadyante mäyämetäà taranti te [Bg. 7.14]). The example may be given that when the sun iscovered by clouds, no man-made apparatus can remove them from the sky, butthe sun itself, which created the clouds, can immediately burn away the cloudycovering and reveal itself. Similarly, when we become covered by the illusorypotency of the Lord we identify with our temporary material body, and thus weare always in fear and anxiety. But when we surrender to the Lord Himself, Hecan immediately free us from this illusion. The material world is padaà padaàyad vipadäm; [SB 10.14.58] it is dangerous at every step. When a living entityunderstands that he is not the material body but an eternal servant of God, hisfear is vanquished. As stated by Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, atrabhaktaiù saàsära-bandhän na bhetavyaà sa hi bhaktau pravartamänasya svataeväpayäti: "In this bhägavata-dharma devotees have no need to fear thebondage of material existence. That fear goes away of its own accord for one who engages in devotional service."</div>
<div class="First">It is important to make clear that bhayam, or fear, cannot ultimately bevanquished simply by impersonal self-realization as expressed by the wordsahaà brahmäsmi(91), "I am spirit soul." In Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.5.12) NäradaMuni says to Vyäsadeva, naiñkarmyam apy acyuta-bhäva-varjitaà na çobhate:mere naiñkarmyam, or cessation of material activities and repudiation of thebodily concept of life, cannot ultimately save one. The living entity must finda superior shelter on the spiritual platform; otherwise he will come back to thefearful situation of material existence. That is stated in çästra: äruhyakåcchreëa paraà padaà tataù patanty adho 'nädåta-yuñmad-aìghrayaù (SB10.2.32). Although one may with great labor and effort struggle up to theBrahman platform (kleço 'dhikataras teñäm avyaktäsakta-cetasäm [Bg. 12.5]), ifhe does not find a suitable shelter he will come back to the material platform.His so-called liberation is vimukta-mäna, liberation by imagination.The living entity is by nature pleasure-seeking, änanda-maya. Now we aresuffering because we are falsely seeking pleasure on the material platform andas a result we are becoming entangled in the painful complexities of materialexistence. But if we try to give up the pleasure-seeking propensity altogether,we shall eventually become frustrated and return to the platform of materialpleasure-seeking. Although there is eternal existence on the Brahmanplatform of impersonal realization, there is no änanda. Variety is the mother ofenjoyment. In the Vaikuëöha planets there is actual, spiritual änanda. Kåñëa isthere in His ecstatic, spiritual form, surrounded by His blissful associates, all ofthem eternally full of bliss and knowledge. They have nothing to do withmaterial existence. In the spiritual planets even the scenery and birds andanimals are fully conscious of Kåñëa and are absorbed in transcendental bliss.Yad gatvä na nivartante tad dhäma paramaà mama (Bg. 15.6). One who goes tothe blissful, spiritual planet of Kåñëa will be fully satisfied and never comeback to the material platform. Therefore Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura hassaid, kià cätra bhaktaiù saàsära-bandhän na bhetavyam. Only the bhakta actually becomes free from fear.</div>
<div class="First">In this connection Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has emphasizedthe necessity of accepting a bona fide spiritual master who isvrajendranandana-preñöha, the dearmost servitor of the son of NandaMahäräja, Kåñëa. The bona fide spiritual master is completely free from envyof other living entities, and therefore he freely distributes knowledge ofdevotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When the livingentities who are inimical to the service of the Lord somehow hear thisknowledge submissively, they become free from the illusory potency of theLord, which has covered them and thrown them into various miserable speciesof life. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, by the mercy ofthe spiritual master the faithful disciple gradually realizes the transcendentalposition of Lord Näräyaëa, who is served with great awe and reverence byhundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune. As the disciple'stranscendental knowledge gradually increases, even the paramaiçvarya, orsupreme opulence, of the Lord of Vaikuëöha becomes pale in the light of thebeauty of Govinda, Kåñëa. Govinda has inconceivable potency to enchant andgive pleasure, and by the mercy of the spiritual master the disciple graduallydevelops his own blissful relationship (rasa) with Govinda. Having understoodthe blissful pastimes of Lakñmé-Näräyaëa, Çré Sétä-Räma,Rukmiëé-Dvärakädhéça and finally Lord Kåñëa Himself, the purified livingentity is given the unique privilege of participating directly in the devotionalservice of Kåñëa, who becomes his only object and shelter.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Although the duality of the material world does not ultimately exist, the conditioned soul experiences it as real under the influence of his own conditioned intelligence. This imaginary experience of a world separate from Kåñëa can be compared to the acts of dreaming and desiring. When the conditioned soul dreams at night of something desirable or horrible, or when he daydreams of what he would like to have or avoid, he creates a reality that has no existence beyond his own imagination. The tendency of the mind is to accept and reject various activities based on sense gratification. Therefore an intelligent person should control the mind, restricting it from the illusion of seeing things separate from Kåñëa, and when the mind is thus controlled he will experience actual fearlessness.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Although the conditioned mind is bewildered by the objects of sensegratification offered by mäyä, illusion, if one takes to the unalloyed devotionalservice of the Lord such material sense gratification gradually dissipates, for itis merely a mental concoction of the conditioned soul. Çréla Çrédhara Sväméhas emphasized by the words avyabhicäriëé bhakti that one cannot dissipate theillusion of material sense gratification unless one takes to the unalloyeddevotional service of the Lord. As Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé has stated:</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">[Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 1.1.11(92)]</div>
<div class="First">Unalloyed devotional service cannot be mixed with material sensegratification or mental speculation. The servant must act only for thesatisfaction of the master. Similarly, Lord Kåñëa states in Bhagavad-gétä, mämekaà çaraëaà vraja. One must see only Kåñëa everywhere and must actexclusively for the satisfaction of Lord Kåñëa, the eternal master of every living entity.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted several verses from the Hari-vaàçaillustrating that the living entity bewildered by identifying with his materialbody, home, family, friends and so on and thus entangled in the cycle of birthand death accepts phantasmagoria as reality. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé,çravaëa-kértanädi-lakñaëa-mätratvaà yato na vyähanyeta: if one seriouslydesires to vanquish the duality of material illusion, one must adopt the processof chanting and hearing the glories of the Supreme Lord. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu also cited the following Vedic reference:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">harer näma harer näma</div>

<div class="First">According to Vedic literatures the living entities of this Kali-yuga are veryfeeble in their power to understand spiritual knowledge (mandäùsumanda-matayo manda-bhägyä hy upadrutäù [SB 1.1.10]). Their minds arealways disturbed. and they are lazy and misguided by so many bogus leaders.They are further described in the Bhägavatam as niùsattvän (impatient andimpious). durmedhän (possessed of weak intelligence) and hrasitäyuñaù (veryshort lived). Therefore one who seriously wants to overcome the ignorance ofmaterial life must surrender to the process of chanting and hearing the holyname of the Lord—Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ HareRäma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare—as well as reciting and renderingsubmissive aural reception to the transcendental literatures presented by theLord, such as Bhagavad-gétä, Çrémad-Bhägavatam and Caitanya-caritämåta. Itshould be understood that the living entity is completely spiritual and neveractually becomes mixed with material energy (asaìgo hy ayaà puruñaù).According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, tasmin çuddhe 'pi kalpyate: although theliving entity is çuddha, pure spirit soul, he imagines that he is a materialcreation and thus entangles himself in the network of illusion called dehäpatya-kalaträdi [SB 2.1.4].</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has used the word mänasa-pratyakñato describe the experience of material life. Mänasa-pratyakña means "thatwhich is experienced only within the mind." The actual pratyakña is described in Bhagavad-gétä (9.2):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">räja-vidyä räja-guhyaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">pavitram idam uttamam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">pratyakñävagamaà dharmyaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">susukhaà kartum avyayam</div>
<div class="First">When one submissively hears the instructions given by the Lord Himself inBhagavad-gétä, which constitute the king of all knowledge (räja-vidyä) and themost confidential of all information (räja-guhyam), by associating with suchspotless spiritual knowledge (pavitram idam uttamam) one can directlyexperience one's eternal nature (pratyakñävagamam). By experiencing one'seternal nature, one becomes thoroughly religious (dharmyam), blissful(susukham) and eternally engaged in the devotional service of the Lord (kartum avyayam).</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has quoted the following çruti-mantrain this connection: vijita-håñéka-väyubhir adänta-manas turagam. "By the verysenses and life air one has conquered, the uncurbed mind will again drag oneaway." According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura the meaning of thisverse is samavahäya guroç caraëam: if one rejects the lotus feet of one'sspiritual master, all of one's previous spiritual advancement becomes null andvoid. This has already been indicated in the previous verse by the wordsguru-devatätmä. Unless one accepts a bona fide spiritual master in theauthorized paramparä as one's worshipable deity and life and soul, there is no question of overcoming the duality of material life.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has made the following commentson this verse. "Control of the mind is a result of living a life of devotionalservice to the Lord. By the influence of fixed devotional service, the acceptingand rejecting mind can stop its thirst for sensory enjoyment apart from Kåñëa.In transcendental Kåñëa consciousness there is no contradiction, pettiness orlack of ecstasy. In other words, it is not like a material object, which alwaysproves temporary and constantly miserable. Having forgotten Kåñëa, theconditioned living entity is suffering the misdirection and perversion of hisown so-called intelligence. The living entities are fragmental parts of thesupreme shelter, Kåñëa, but have fallen from Kåñëa's kingdom of spiritualpastimes. Because of forgetting the Supreme Lord, they become prone to sinfullife and turn their attention to dangerous material objects, which fill themwith constant fear. If one desires to subdue the mind, which is constantlyengaged in the duality of mental concoction, one must take to the devotional service of Lord Kåñëa."</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> An intelligent person who has controlled his mind and conquered fear should give up all attachment to material objects such as wife, family and nation and should wander freely without embarrassment, hearing and chanting the holy names of the Lord, the bearer of the chariot wheel. The holy names of Kåñëa are all-auspicious because they describe His transcendental birth and activities, which He performs within this world for the salvation of the conditioned souls. Thus the holy names of the Lord are sung throughout the world.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Since the holy names, forms and pastimes of the Supreme Personality ofGodhead are unlimited, no one can hear or chant about all of them. Thereforethe word loke indicates that one should chant the holy names of the Lord thatare well known on this particular planet. Within this world, Lord Räma andLord Kåñëa are very famous. Their books, Rämäyaëa and Bhagavad-gétä, arestudied and relished all over the world. Similarly, Caitanya Mahäprabhu isgradually becoming famous all over the world, as He Himself predicted.Påthivéte äche yata nagarädi gräma/ sarvatra pracära haibe mora näma: "In everytown and village on this earth the glories of My name will be chanted."Therefore in conformity with the authorized statement of this verse ofÇrémad-Bhägavatam, the Kåñëa consciousness movement emphasizes themahä-mantra—Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma,Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare—along with the Païca-tattvamahä-mantra—çré-kåñëa-caitanya prabhu-nityänanda çré-advaita gadädhara çréväsädi-gaura-bhakta-vånda.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, this blissful process of chanting the holynames of the Lord without any material conception is called sugamaà märgam,a very enjoyable path. Similarly, Lord Kåñëa has described the process ofbhakti-yoga as susukhaà kartum, very joyfully performed, and Çréla Locanadäsa Öhäkura has sung, saba avatära sära çiromaëi kevala änanda-käëòa.Caitanya Mahäprabhu's process for worshiping Kåñëa is kevala änanda-käëòa,simply joyful. In this connection Çréla Prabhupäda has stated that people inany part of the world can assemble, chant the Hare Kåñëa mantra, read fromauthorized books such as Bhagavad-gétä As It Is, and accept kåñëa-prasädamsumptuously, just as Caitanya Mahäprabhu did in Navadvépa.To be successful in this program, however, Locana däsa Öhäkura haswarned, viñaya chäòiyä: one must give up material sense gratification. If oneindulges in material sense gratification, surely he will be in the bodily conceptof life. One who is in the bodily concept of life will undoubtedly have amaterialistic understanding of the pastimes of the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. Thus, by considering the Lord's pastimes mundane, one will comewithin the category of Mäyäväda, or impersonalism, in which one considersthe transcendental body of the Lord to be a creation of material nature.Therefore the word asaìgaù in this verse is very significant. One must chantthe holy name of the Lord without mental speculation. One must accept LordKåñëa as He presents Himself in Bhagavad-gétä, wherein He states that Healone is Puruñottama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and that Histranscendental form is eternal (ajo 'pi sann avyayätmä).Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has emphasized, yäni çästra-dvärä sat-paramparä-dväräca loke gétäni janmäni karmäëi ca, täni çåëvan gäyaàç ca: if one wants to besuccessful in chanting and hearing the holy name of the Lord, one must adoptthe process as it is coming down in the sat-paramparä, the transcendentaldisciplic succession. And the sat-paramparä can be identified by reference tobona fide Vedic scriptures. Contrary to the opinion of uninformed critics, thefollowers of Kåñëa consciousness are not mindless or fanatical. Theyintelligently follow the system of checks and balances called guru, sädhu andçästra. That is, one must accept a bona fide spiritual master, who must in turnbe confirmed by the opinion of great saintly persons and revealed scriptures. Ifone accepts a bona fide spiritual master, follows the example of great saintlypersons and becomes conversant with authorized literature such asBhagavad-gétä As It Is and Çrémad-Bhägavatam, one's program of chanting theholy names of the Lord and hearing about the Lord's pastimes will becompletely successful. As Kåñëa states in Bhagavad-gétä (4.9):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">janma karma ca me divyam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">evaà yo vetti tattvataù</div>

<div class="First">"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activitiesdoes not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in the material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna."</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has stated that throughout the worldthe Supreme Lord is known by many names, some of them expressed invernacular language, but any name used to indicate the Supreme Personalityof Godhead, who is one without a second, beyond the influence of materialnature, can be accepted as a holy name of God, according to this verse. That is indicated by the word loke.</div>
<div class="First">One should not misinterpret the word vicaret, "one should wander," to meanthat while chanting the holy names of Kåñëa one may go anywhere or engagein any activity without discrimination. Therefore it is stated, vicared asaìgaù:one may wander freely, but at the same time one must strictly avoid theassociation of those who are not interested in Kåñëa consciousness or who areengaged in sinful life. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu has stated, asat-saìga-tyäga-eivaiñëava äcära (Cc. Madhya 22.87): a Vaiñëava is known by his completeavoidance of all mundane association. If in the course of traveling andchanting the glories of the Lord a Vaiñëava preacher finds a submissivenondevotee who is willing to hear about Kåñëa, the preacher will always givehis merciful association to such a person. But a Vaiñëava should strictly avoid those who are not interested in hearing about Kåñëa.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, those who do notengage in hearing the astonishing pastimes and holy names of the SupremePersonality of Godhead and who do not relish the Lord's pastimes are simplyexecuting mundane, illusory activities or indulging in false, materialisticrenunciation. Frustrated living entities sometimes take to dry impersonalismand avoid the descriptions of the Supreme Lord's eternal name, form, qualities,entourage and pastimes. But if one gains the association of a pure devotee, onegives up the path of dry speculative argument and becomes situated on the actual Vedic path of devotional service to the Lord.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura says that the word dvaita, or"duality," expresses the false understanding that some object has a substantialexistence independent of Kåñëa. The Mäyäväda conception of advaita, whichlacks any spiritual distinctions, is simply another manifestation of the mind'sfunction of acceptance and rejection. The eternal appearance and pastimes ofthe Supreme Personality of Godhead never contradict the concept ofadvaya-jïäna, or transcendental knowledge beyond duality.</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">kåñëa-näma-mahä-mantrera ei ta ' svabhäva</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yei jape, tära kåñëe upajaye bhäva</div>
<div class="First">"It is the nature of the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra that anyone who chants itimmediately develops his loving ecstasy for Kåñëa." (Cc. Ädi 7.83) In thisconnection Çréla Prabhupäda has commented, "These symptoms are veryprominently manifest in the body of a pure devotee. Sometimes when ourstudents of the Kåñëa consciousness movement chant and dance, even in Indiapeople are astonished to see how these foreigners have learned to chant anddance in this ecstatic fashion. As explained by Caitanya Mahäprabhu,however, actually this is not due to practice, for without extra endeavor thesesymptoms become manifest in anyone who sincerely chants the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra."</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has warned us in this regard aboutthe ungodly sahajiyäs who imitate the pastimes of the Supreme Lord in anunauthorized way, neglecting the standard injunctions of Vedic scriptures,foolishly trying to take the position of Kåñëa as Puruñottama, and thus makinga cheap farce of the exalted pastimes of the Lord. Their so-called ecstaticsymptoms like crying, shivering and falling on the ground are not to beconfused with the advanced features of devotional service described byÇrédhara Svämé as sampräpta-prema-lakñaëa-bhakti-yoga. Çréla Prabhupädacomments in this regard, "One who has attained this bhäva stage is no longerunder the clutches of the illusory energy." Similarly, Kåñëadäsa Kaviräja states:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">païcama puruñärtha-premänandämåta-sindhu</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mokñädi änanda yära nahe eka bindu</div>
<div class="First">"For a devotee who has actually developed bhäva [love of Godhead], thepleasure derived from dharma, artha, käma and mokña appears like a drop inthe presence of the sea." (Cc. Ädi 7.85) As already stated in the previous verseof this chapter, gäyan vilajjo vicared asaìgaù: one exhibits the ecstaticsymptoms of love of Godhead when he is asaìga, free from all attachment to material sense gratification.</div>
<div class="First">The word loka-bähyaù in this verse indicates that a pure devotee on theplatform of prema, love of Godhead, is not at all concerned with ridicule,praise, respect or criticism from ordinary people in the bodily concept of life.Kåñëa is the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and whenHe reveals Himself to a surrendered servant, all doubt and speculation about the nature of the Absolute are vanquished forever.</div>
<div class="First">In this connection Çrépäda Madhväcärya has quoted a verse from the Varäha Puräëa:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kecid unmäda-vad bhaktä</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhaktir jïeyä na cänyataù</div>
<div class="First">"Some devotees of the Lord exhibit external symptoms, acting like madmen,others are introspective devotees, and still others partake of both natures. It isby one's steadfastness and by the merciful vibrations emanating from one'smouth that one's devotion can be judged, not otherwise."Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has given a very nice example toillustrate ecstatic laughing and other symptoms of love of Godhead: 'Oh, thatthief Kåñëa, the son of Yaçodä, has entered the house to steal the fresh butter.Grab Him! Keep Him away!' Hearing these menacing words spoken by theelderly gopé Jaraté, Kåñëa immediately prepares to leave the house. The devoteeto whom this transcendental pastime is revealed laughs in ecstasy. Butsuddenly he can no longer see Kåñëa. He then cries in great lamentation, 'Oh!I achieved the greatest fortune in the world, and now it has suddenly slippedfrom my hands!' Thus the devotee cries loudly, 'So my Lord! Where are You?Give me Your answer!' The Lord answers, 'My dear devotee, I heard your loudcomplaint, and so I have again come before you.' Upon seeing Lord Kåñëaagain, the devotee begins to sing, 'Today my life has become perfect.' Thusoverwhelmed with transcendental bliss, he begins to dance like a madman."Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura also notes that the word druta-cittaùor "with a melted heart," indicates that one's heart, melted by the fire ofanxiety to see the Lord, becomes like Jambünadé, a river of roseapple juice. Theäcärya further points out, näma-kértanasya sarvotkarñam: the present andprevious verse clearly distinguish the exalted position of çravaëaà kértanaàviñëoù [SB 7.5.23], chanting and hearing the name and glories of the SupremePersonality of Godhead. Caitanya Mahäprabhu also emphasized this by quoting:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">harer näma harer näma</div>

In his purports to Caitanya-caritämåta (Ädi 7.76), ÇrélaPrabhupäda has given an elaborate explanation of this verse.Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura recommends that we study the following verse in this connection:</div>

<div class="Translation"> A devotee should not see anything as being separate from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Ether, fire, air, water, earth, the sun and other luminaries, all living beings, the directions, trees and other plants, the rivers and oceans—whatever a devotee experiences he should consider to be an expansion of Kåñëa. Thus seeing everything that exists within creation as the body of the Supreme Lord, Hari, the devotee should offer his sincere respects to the entire expansion of the Lord's body.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has given this example from the Puräëas: yat paçyati, tattv anurägätiçayena "jagad dhana-mayaà lubdhäù kämukäù käminé-mayam"iti-vat hareù çaréram. "Because of a greedy person's obsession with money,wherever he goes he sees an opportunity for acquiring wealth. Similarly a verylusty man notices women everywhere." In the same way, a pure devotee shouldsee the transcendental form of the Lord within everything, since everything isan expansion of the Lord. It is our practical experience that a greedy man willsee money everywhere. If he goes to the forest he will immediately considerwhether it would be profitable to purchase the forest land and sell the trees toa paper mill. Similarly, if a lusty man goes to the same forest he will lookeverywhere for beautiful women tourists who might happen to be there. And ifa devotee goes to the same forest he will see Kåñëa there, knowing correctlythat the entire forest, as well as the sky canopy above, is the inferior energy ofthe Lord. Kåñëa is supremely sacred, being the Supreme Personality ofGodhead, and since everything that exists expands directly or indirectly fromthe body of the Lord, everything is sacred when seen through the eyes of aself-realized person. Therefore as stated in this verse, praëamet: one shouldoffer one's sincere respects to everything. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has mentionedthat we should see the personal form of Kåñëa everywhere.This verse does not approve of the impersonal, atheistic philosophy thateverything is God. In this regard, Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted from the Hari-vaàça:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sarvaà harer vaçatvena</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">çaréraà tasya bhaëyate</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ananyädhipatitväc ca</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tad ananyam udéryate</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na cäpy abhedo jagatäà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">viñëoù pürëa-guëasya tu</div>
<div class="First">"Because everything is under the control of the Supreme Lord, Hari,everything is considered to be His body. He is the original source and master ofeverything, and therefore nothing should be seen as different from Him.Nonetheless, one should not foolishly conclude that there is absolutely nodifference between the material universe and Lord Viñëu, who is full of His own unique spiritual qualities."</div>
<div class="First">The example is often given of the sun and the sun's rays. The sunshine isnothing but an expansion of the sun globe, and therefore there is noqualitative difference between the sun and its rays. But although the sunshineis situated everywhere and although everything is a transformation of the sun'senergy, the sun globe itself, the source of the sunshine, is not everywhere, butis situated in a particular place in the vast sky and has its own specific form.If we penetrate further into the sun globe we shall find the sun-god,Vivasvän. Although pseudointellectuals of the modern age who are incapableof even counting the hairs on their own heads will consider the sun-god amythological figure, it is actually the foolish mythology of modern men tothink that such a sophisticated apparatus as the sun, which provides heat andlight for the entire universe, can function without intelligent administration.Transformations of solar energy make life possible on earth, and thus the earthcan be understood to consist of an endless variety of secondary manifestations of all-pervading solar energy.</div>
<div class="First">So within the sun planet is the personality Vivasvän, the chiefadministrator of the solar functions; the sun globe itself is localized; and thesun's rays expand everywhere. Similarly Çré Kåñëa, Çyämasundara, is theoriginal Personality of Godhead (bhagavän svayam); He expands Himself as thelocalized Supersoul (Paramätmä) in everyone's heart; and finally He expandsHis potency by His personal bodily glow, the all-pervading spiritual effulgencecalled the brahmajyoti. The entire material manifestation floats within the raysof this brahmajyoti. Just as all life on earth is a transformation of theall-pervading rays of the sun, the entire cosmic manifestation is atransformation of the spiritual rays of the brahmajyoti. As stated in the Brahma-saàhitä (5.40):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yasya prabhä prabhavato jagad-aëòa-koöikoöiñv</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">açeña-vasudhädi vibhüti-bhinnam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tad brahma niñkalam anantam açeña-bhütaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi</div>
<div class="First">"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is endowed with great power. Theglowing effulgence of His transcendental form is the impersonal Brahman,which is absolute, complete and unlimited and which displays the varieties ofcountless planets, with their different opulences, in millions and millions ofuniverses." Therefore, the brahmajyoti is the spiritual light that emanatesdirectly from the body of the Lord. This universe is a transformation of thatspiritual energy, and therefore everything that exists is in one sense connecteddirectly with the personal body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.It is emphasized here that we should offer respect to everything that exists,recognizing it to be the energy of the Lord. The example may be given that if aman is important his property is also important. The president of a country isthe most important person in the country, and therefore everyone mustrespect his property. Similarly, everything that exists is an expansion of theSupreme Personality of Godhead and should be respected accordingly. If wefail to see everything that exists as the energy of the Lord, we risk the dangerof drifting into the Mäyäväda philosophy, which according to CaitanyaMahäprabhu is the most deadly poison for one trying to advance in actualspiritual life. Mäyävädi-bhäñya çunile haya sarva-näça (Cc. Madhya 6.169). If wetry to understand Kåñëa alone, without the expansion of His potency, we shallnot understand such statements in Bhagavad-gétä as väsudevaù sarvam and ahaà sarvasya prabhavaù [Bg. 10.8].</div>
<div class="First">As already explained in this chapter, bhayaà dvitiyäbhiniveçataù syät: fearor illusion arises from thinking that there is something not dependent uponthe Supreme Personality of Godhead. Now, in this verse, the specific processfor overcoming this fearful illusion is given. One must train one's mind to seeeverything that exists as an expansion of the potency of the Supreme Lord. Byoffering respects to everything and meditating upon everything as part of thebody of the Lord, one will become free from fear. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä(5.29), suhådaà sarva-bhütänäm: Kåñëa is the well-wishing friend of everyliving being. As soon as one understands that everything that exists is underthe powerful control of one's most beloved friend, one comes to the stage inwhich the whole universe becomes a blissful abode (viçvaà pürëa-sukhäyate), because he sees Kåñëa everywhere.</div>
<div class="First">If Kåñëa's personality were not the source of everything and if everythingwere not connected to Kåñëa, one might be proper in concluding that Kåñëa'spersonality is a material manifestation of some impersonal truth. As stated inVedänta-sütra, janmädy asya yataù: [SB 1.1.1] the Absolute Truth is that fromwhich everything emanates. Similarly, Kåñëa says, ahaà sarvasya prabhavaù:[Bg. 10.8] "I am the source of everything." If we see anything totallydisconnected from the personal body of Kåñëa, we may doubt whether Kåñëa'spersonality is actually the absolute source described in Vedänta-sütra. As soonas one feels this way, he becomes fearful and should be understood to be under the control of the Lord's illusory energy.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has warned us that if we do notsee everything as a manifestation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, weshall become victims of phalgu-vairägya, or immature renunciation. Whateverwe see as disconnected from Kåñëa will have in our mind no relationship toKåñëa's service. But if we see everything as connected to Kåñëa, we shall useeverything for Kåñëa's satisfaction. This is called yukta-vairägya. According toÇréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, "One who has experienced his owntrue identity understands that all things exist as paraphernalia for givingecstatic pleasure to the Supreme Lord. Thus one becomes free from theseparatist vision in which one sees the world as existing for one's ownenjoyment. In the transcendental state, whatever a devotee sees reminds himof Kåñëa, and thus his transcendental knowledge and bliss increase." Becausethe impersonalist philosophers fail to see everything as belonging to thepersonal form of Kåñëa, they reject this world as having no true existence(jagan mithyä). But since the material world is an emanation from the supremereality, Kåñëa, it does in fact exist. Its nonexistence is simply a creation of theimagination, and one cannot possibly act on such an imaginary platform.Therefore, having proposed an illusory theory and being unable actually to liveon such a platform, the impersonalist comes back to the material platform foraltruistic or gross sense gratificatory activities. Since the impersonalist doesnot accept the personal proprietorship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,he does not know how or for whom to engage the things of this world, andsince it is impossible to reject this world totally while living within it, he runsthe risk of again becoming entangled in material fruitive activities. Thereforeas stated in Bhagavad-gétä (12.5), kleço 'dhikataras teñäm: the impersonal path of imaginary philosophy is very painful to follow.</div>
<div class="First">The conclusion is that this verse is spoken to help the devotee of theSupreme Lord advance in Kåñëa consciousness. It can be understood from theprevious verses of this chapter that the ultimate goal is pure devotional serviceto Lord Kåñëa. If one falsely interprets this verse to sanction the imaginaryMäyäväda philosophy that everything is God, one will simply becomebewildered and fall from the path of spiritual advancement.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Devotion, direct experience of the Supreme Lord, and detachment from other things—these three occur simultaneously for one who has taken shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in the same way that pleasure, nourishment and relief from hunger come simultaneously and increasingly, with each bite, for a person engaged in eating.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has explained this analogy as follows: Bhakti, ordevotion, may be compared to tuñöi (satisfaction) because they both take theform of pleasure. Pareçänubhava (experience of the Supreme Lord) and puñöi(nourishment) are analogous because both sustain one's life. Finally, virakti(detachment) and kñud-apäya (cessation of hunger) may be compared becauseboth free one from further hankering so that one may experience çänti, or peace.</div>
<div class="First">A person who is eating not only becomes uninterested in other activitiesbut increasingly becomes uninterested in the food itself, according to hissatisfaction. On the other hand, according to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, although onewho is experiencing the blissful Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, becomesuninterested in anything other than Kåñëa, his attachment to Kåñëa increasesat every moment. Therefore it is to be understood that the transcendentalbeauty and qualities of the Supreme Lord are not material, since one neverbecomes satiated by relishing the bliss of the Supreme Lord.The word viraktiù is very significant in this verse. Virakti means"detachment," whereas tyäga means "renunciation." According to ÇrélaBhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, the word renunciation can be used in asituation in which one considers giving up an enjoyable object. But byconsidering everything to be potential paraphernalia in the service of LordKåñëa, as described in the previous verse, one need not give thought torenunciation, for one uses everything in the proper way in the service of the Lord. Yukta-vairägyam ucyate.</div>
<div class="First">The very pleasant analogy of a good meal is given in this verse. A hungryman busily consuming a sumptuous plate of food is not interested in anythingelse happening around him. In fact, he considers any other topic or activity adisturbance to his concentration on the delicious meal. Similarly, as oneadvances in Kåñëa consciousness one considers anything unrelated to thedevotional service of Kåñëa an obnoxious disturbance. Such concentrated loveof Godhead has been described in the Second Canto of the Bhägavatam by thewords tévreëa bhakti-yogena yajeta puruñaà param (SB 2.3.10). One should notmake an artificial show of renouncing the material world; rather, one shouldsystematically train the mind to see everything as an expansion of theopulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Just as a hungry materialisticman, upon seeing sumptuous food, immediately desires to put it in his mouth,an advanced devotee of Kåñëa, upon seeing a material object, immediatelybecomes eager to use it for the pleasure of Kåñëa. Without the spontaneoushunger to engage everything in the service of Kåñëa and to dive deeper anddeeper into the ocean of love of Kåñëa, so-called realization of God or loosetalk about so-called religious life is irrelevant to the actual experience of entering the kingdom of God.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the path of bhakti-yogais so joyful and practical that even in the stage of sädhana-bhakti, in which onefollows rules and regulations without an advanced understanding, one canperceive the ultimate result.

Thus devotion, direct experience of the Personality ofGodhead, and detachment from other objects become manifest even in thebeginning stage of bhakti-yoga, since bhakti-yoga begins at the point ofliberation.

Çréla Prabhupäda comments, "Tobecome desireless means not to desire anything for sense gratification. In otherwords, desire for becoming Kåñëa conscious is actually desirelessness." There isa similar statement in the Caitanya-caritämåta (Madhya 19.149):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kåñëa-bhakta-niñkäma, ataeva 'çänta'</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhukti-mukti-siddhi-kämé sakali 'açänta'</div>
<div class="First">"Because a devotee of Lord Kåñëa is desireless, he is peaceful. Fruitive workersdesire material enjoyment, jïänés desire liberation, and yogés desire materialopulence; therefore they are all lusty and cannot be peaceful."Generally there are three classes of living entities afflicted with selfishdesire. These are the bhukti-kämé, mukti-kämi and siddhi-kämi. Bhukti-kämérefers to those ordinary persons who desire money and everything money canbuy. Such a primitive mentality is based on the desire to enjoy money, sex andsocial prestige. When a living being becomes frustrated with this hallucination,he takes to the path of speculative philosophy and analytically tries to trackdown the source of illusion. Such a person is called mukti-kämé because hedesires to negate material illusion and merge into an impersonal spiritual state,free from anxiety. The mukti-kämé is also motivated by personal desire,although the desire is somewhat more elevated. Similarly the siddhi-kämé, orthe mystic yogé who desires the spectacular powers of mystic yoga, such asreaching one's hand across the world or making oneself smaller than thesmallest or lighter than the lightest, is also infected by material or selfishdesire. Therefore it is said, sakali 'açänta.' If one has any personal desire,whether it be material, philosophical or mystic, he will be açänta, or ultimatelyfrustrated, because he will see himself as the central object of satisfaction. Thisegocentric concept is in itself illusory and therefore ultimately frustrating.On the other hand, kåñëa-bhakta niñkäma, ataeva 'çänta': [Cc. Madhya19.149] a devotee of Lord Kåñëa is niñkäma; he has no personal desire. His onlydesire is to please Kåñëa. Lord Çiva himself has praised this outstanding quality</div>

The devotee sees everything as the potency of theSupreme Personality of Godhead and therefore desires to engage everything inthe service of the Lord, for the Lord's satisfaction. Since the devotee does notsee anything as dvitéya, or outside the scope of the Lord's potency, he is happyin any situation. Having no personal desire, the devotee of Kåñëa is actuallyçänta, or peaceful, because he has achieved the perfection of life, love of Kåñëa.He is actually situated in his eternal constitutional position under the directshelter and protection of the omnipotent Parameçvara, Kåñëa.According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, this verse ends theanswer given by the first of the nine Yogendras, Kavi, to Mahäräja Nimi's first question, "What is the highest good?"</div>

<div class="Translation"> Mahäräja Nimi said: Now please tell me in greater detail about the devotees of the Supreme Lord. What are the natural symptoms by which I can distinguish between the most advanced devotees, those on the middle level and those who are neophytes? What are the typical religious activities of a Vaiñëava, and how does he speak? Specifically, please describe those symptoms and characteristics by which Vaiñëavas become dear to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The great sage Kavi has informed King Nimi about the general externalsymptoms of a devotee of the Lord, namely his appearance, personal qualitiesand activities. But now King Nimi asks how to make further distinctionsamong the servants of the Supreme Personality of Godhead so that thefirst-class, second-class and lower-class Vaiñëavas can be clearly identified.According to Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé, kåñëeti yasya giri taà manasädriyeta:"One should mentally honor any devotee who chants the holy name of LordKåñëa." (Upadeçämåta 5) Any living entity who is faithfully chanting the holyname of Kåñëa is to be considered a Vaiñëava and at least within the mind is tobe offered respect. But for practical advancement in Kåñëa consciousness oneshould associate at least with a second-class devotee. And if one can receivethe mercy of a first-class devotee of the Lord, one's perfection is very easilyguaranteed. Thus Nimi Mahäräja is humbly inquiring, "What are thecharacter, behavior and speech of devotees?" The King wants to know theparticular symptoms of body, mind and speech by which the differentcategories uttama-adhikäré, madhyama-adhikäré and kaniñöha-adhikäré areclearly identified. In response to the King's inquiry, another of thenava-yogendras, namely Havir, will give a further elaboration of the science of Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="First"></div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">In Bhagavad-gétä (6.30) the Lord says,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yo mäà paçyati sarvatra</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sarvaà ca mayi paçyati</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tasyähaà na praëaçyämi</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sa ca me na praëaçyati</div>
<div class="First">"For one who sees Me everywhere and sees everything in Me, I am never lost,nor is he ever lost to Me." Çréla Prabhupäda comments, "A person in Kåñëaconsciousness certainly sees Lord Kåñëa everywhere, and he sees everything inKåñëa. Such a person may appear to see all separate manifestations of thematerial nature, but in each and every instance he is conscious of Kåñëa,knowing that everything is the manifestation of Kåñëa's energy. Nothing canexist without Kåñëa, and Kåñëa is the Lord of everything-this is the basic principle of Kåñëa consciousness."</div>
<div class="First">The qualification for seeing Kåñëa everywhere is stated in the Brahma-saàhitä (5.38):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">premäïjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">santaù sadaiva hådayeñu vilokayanti</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yaà syämasundaram acintya-guëa-svarüpaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi</div>
<div class="First">"I worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, who is always seen by the devoteewhose eyes are anointed with the pulp of love. He is seen in His eternal formof Çyämasundara, situated within the heart of the devotee." A devotee of thehighest level of spiritual qualification is glorified for the expansiveness of hisspiritual vision. For example, when the stalwart demon Hiraëyakaçipuquestioned his self-realized son Prahläda Mahäräja as to the whereabouts ofthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, Prahläda, being a mahä-bhägavata, orpure devotee, answered straightforwardly that the Supreme Lord iseverywhere. The demoniac father then asked if God was in the pillar of thepalace. When Prahläda answered yes, Hiraëyakaçipu, being a bona fide demon,struck the pillar with his sword, trying to kill God, or at least disprove Hisexistence. Then Lord Nåsiàhadeva, the most ferocious form of the SupremeLord, immediately appeared and finished forever the illicit program ofHiraëyakaçipu. Thus Prahläda Mahäräja can be accepted as an uttama-adhikäré devotee.</div>
<div class="First">A pure devotee is completely free from the tendency to enjoy thingsseparately from the Lord's service. He does not see anything in the universe asunfavorable, because he sees everything as the expanded potency of theSupreme Personality of Godhead. Such a devotee's purpose in existing is togive pleasure somehow or other to the Supreme Lord. Thus everything that apure devotee experiences, moment by moment, increases his ecstatic lovingdesire to satisfy the transcendental senses of the Lord.The three modes of material nature torment the conditioned soul, whoabsorbs his mind in the separated, material energy of the Lord. The function ofthis separated energy, bhinnä prakåti, is to take the living entity away from thereality, which is that everything is within Kåñëa and Kåñëa is withineverything. Being covered by gross ignorance, the bewildered conditioned soulbelieves that only the objects of his own limited vision actually exist.Sometimes such foolish persons speculate that if a tree falls in a forest with noone to hear it, there will actually be no sound. The conditioned souls do notconsider that since the Supreme Personality of Godhead is all-pervading, thereis no question of no one's hearing; the Lord always hears. As stated in theThirteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä (13.14), sarvataù çrutimal loke: theSupreme Lord hears everything. He is upadrañöa, the witness of everything (Bg. 13.23).</div>
<div class="First">In this verse the word bhägavatottamaù, "the most advanced devotee,"indicates that there are those who are not gross materialists but who are notthe highest devotees. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura,those who cannot properly distinguish between devotees and nondevotees andwho therefore never worship the pure devotees of the Lord are to be known askaniñöha-adhikäris, devotees on the lowest stage of devotional service. Suchkaniñöha-adhikäris engage in worship of the Supreme Lord, especially in thetemple, but are indifferent to the Lord's devotees. Thus they misunderstand this statement by Lord Çiva in the Padma Puräëa:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ärädhanänäà sarveñäà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">viñëor ärädhanaà param</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tasmäd parataraà devi</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tadéyänäà samarcanam</div>
<div class="First">"O Devé, the most exalted system of worship is the worship of Lord Viñëu.Greater than that is the worship of tadéya, or anything belonging to Viñëu."Çréla Prabhupäda comments on this verse, "Çré Viñëu is sac-cid-änanda-vigraha[Bs. 5.1]. Similarly the most confidential servant of Kåñëa, the spiritual master,and all devotees of Viñëu are tadéya. The sac-cid-änanda-vigraha, guru,Vaiñëavas and things used by them must be considered tadéya, and without adoubt worshipable by all living beings." (Cc. Madhya 12.38 purport)Typically the kaniñöha-adhikäré is eager to engage his materialisticqualifications in the service of the Lord, mistaking such material expertise tobe the sign of advanced devotion. But by continuing to serve the SupremeLord and the devotees engaged in propagating the Lord's mission, thekaniñöha-adhikäré also advances in his realization and comes to the stage ofdedicating his activities to helping more advanced Vaiñëavas. Even suchkaniñöha-adhikärés can help ordinary living entities by their association, sinceat least the kaniñöha-adhikärés have faith that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personalityof Godhead. Because of this faith, the kaniñöha-adhikäré gradually becomesinimical to those who are opposed to the Lord. As he gradually becomes moreand more inimical to those who hate the supremacy of the SupremePersonality of Godhead and becomes more attracted to friendship with otherfaithful servants of the Lord, the kaniñöha-adhikäré approaches the second-classstage, called madhyama. In the madhyama stage the Vaiñëava sees the Lord asthe cause of all causes and the chief goal of everyone's loving propensity. Hesees the Vaiñëavas as his only friends within this morbid world and is eager tobring innocent people within the shelter of Vaiñëava society. Also, amadhyama-adhikäré strictly avoids associating with the self-proclaimed enemiesof God. When such an intermediate qualification becomes mature, theconcept of supreme qualification begins to present itself; that is, one comes to the stage of uttama-adhikäré.</div>
<div class="First">A kaniñöha-adhikäré guru, one who is simply attached to performingreligious ceremonies and worshiping the Deity, without appreciation for otherVaiñëavas, especially those who are preaching the message of the Lord, willespecially appeal to persons interested in the dry cultivation of knowledge. Asa living entity develops mundane piety, he proudly devotes himself toregulated work and nobly tries to detach himself from the fruits of his work.Through such regulated detached work, knowledge or wisdom gradually arises.As knowledge or wisdom becomes prominent, the pious materialist becomesattracted to altruistic and charitable work and gives up gross sinful activities. Ifhe is fortunate, he then becomes favorable to the transcendental devotionalservice of the Lord. Desiring a mere intellectual understanding of devotionalservice, such a pious materialist may seek shelter at the feet of akaniñöha-adhikäré. If able to advance to the madhyama qualification, he thenbecomes attracted to a Vaiñëava actively engaged in preaching Kåñëaconsciousness. And when fully mature on the platform of intermediatedevotion, he becomes attracted to the mahä-bhägavata level and is awarded aglimpse of the exalted position of the mahä-bhägavata spiritual master by thegrace of Kåñëa within his heart. If one gradually goes on in the devotionalservice of the Lord, one becomes established as a paramahaàsamahä-bhägavata. At this stage all of his actions. movements and engagementsin preaching are dedicated solely to the satisfaction of Kåñëa. The illusorypotency, mäyä, has no power to throw or cover such a purified living entity. InUpadeçämåta (5) Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé has described this stage of life as bhajana-vijïam ananyam anya-nindädi-çünya-hådam.</div>
<div class="First">A mahä-bhägavata, being empowered by the Supreme Lord, Yogeçvara, isendowed with the supernatural power to inspire and give success to themadhyama-adhikäré who follows in his footsteps and to elevate akaniñöha-adhikäré gradually to the intermediate platform. Such devotionalpower springs automatically from the ocean of mercy found within the heart ofa pure devotee. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura points out that amahä-bhägavata has no desire to inflict punishment on the enemies of theLord. Rather, he engages the madhyama-adhikärés and kaniñöha-adhikärés inpreaching work to purify the polluted mentality of the inimical souls, who arefalsely imagining the material world to be separate from Kåñëa.There are unfortunate living entities who are unable to understand theglory of a kaniñöha-adhikäré within the realm of devotional service, have nopraise for the more advanced state of intermediate devotion and cannot evenbegin to understand the most exalted stage, that of the uttama-adhikäré. Suchunfortunate souls, attracted to impersonal Mäyäväda speculation, followfaithfully in the footsteps of Kaàsa, Agha, Baka and Pütanä and are thuskilled by Çré Hari. In this way the community of sense gratifiers remainsuninterested in service at the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, and according tothe individual perverted vision of so-called self-interest, each materialistchooses his own misfortune in the form of repeated birth and death in varioustypes of material bodies. There are 8,400,000 species of material forms, and thematerialistic living entities select the particular flavors of birth, old age,disease and death they wish to inflict upon themselves under the hallucinations of so-called material progress.</div>
<div class="First">The analogy is given that a lusty man, being agitated by sexual desire, seesthe whole world as filled with sensuous women. In a similar way, a puredevotee of Kåñëa sees Kåñëa consciousness everywhere, although it may betemporarily covered. Thus one sees the world just as one sees himself (ätmavanmanyate jagat). On this basis one may argue that the vision of themahä-bhagavata is also illusioned, since the Bhägavatam has already statedthroughout that those conditioned by the three modes of material nature arenot at all Kåñëa conscious but in fact are inimical to Kåñëa. But although theconditioned living entity may appear inimical to the Lord, the eternal,unalterable fact is that every living being is part and parcel of Kåñëa. Althoughone's ecstatic love for Kåñëa may now be covered by the influence of mäyä, bythe causeless mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead the conditionedsoul will gradually be promoted to the stage of Kåñëa consciousness.In fact, everyone is suffering the pangs of separation from Kåñëa. Becausethe conditioned soul imagines that he has no eternal relationship with Kåñëa,he is unable to ascertain that all his miseries are due to this separation. This ismäyä, or "that which is not." Actually, to think that misery arises fromanything other than separation from Kåñëa is to be in illusion. So when a puredevotee sees living entities suffering within this world, he correctly feels thatjust as he is suffering because of separation from Kåñëa, all other living beingsare also suffering from separation from Kåñëa. The difference is that a puredevotee correctly ascertains the cause of his heartbreak whereas theconditioned soul, bewildered by mäyä, is unable to understand his eternalrelationship with Kåñëa and the unlimited pain arising from neglect of that relationship.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has quoted the following verses, which illustrate theecstatic feelings of the topmost devotees of the Lord. In the Tenth Canto ofÇrémad-Bhägavatam (10.35.9) the goddesses of Vraja speak as follows:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">vana-latäs tarava ätmani viñëuà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">vyaïjayantya iva puñpa-phaläòhyäù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">praëata-bhära-viöapä madhu-dhäräù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">prema-håñöa-tanavo vavåñuù sma</div>
<div class="First">"The creepers and trees of the forest, their branches weighed down by richcoverings of flowers and fruits, seemed to manifest Lord Viñëu within theirhearts. Exhibiting eruptions of ecstatic love upon their bodies, they poureddown rains of honey." Elsewhere in the Tenth Canto (SB 10.21.15) it is said:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nadyas tadä tad upadhärya mukunda-gétam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ävarta-lakñita-mano-bhava-bhagna-vegäù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">äliìgana-sthagitam ürmi-bhujair murärer</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">gåhëanti päda-yugalaà kamalopahäräù</div>
<div class="First">"Hearing the song of Lord Mukunda's flute, the rivers then stopped theircurrents, although the minds of the rivers could still be ascertained from thepresence of whirlpools. With the arms of their waves the rivers seized the twolotus feet of Muräri, taking help from the lotus plants, and thus He becametrapped in their embrace." And in the last chapter of the Tenth Canto (10.90.15), the queens of Dvärakä pray:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kurari vilapasi tvaà véta-nidrä na çeñe</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">svapiti jagati rätryäm éçvaro gupta-bodhaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">vayam iva sakhi kaccid gäòha-nirviddha-cetä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nalina-nayana-häsodära-lélekñitena</div>
<div class="First">"Dear kuraré, now it is very late at night. Everyone is sleeping. The wholeworld is now calm and peaceful. At this time, the Supreme Personality ofGodhead is sleeping, although His knowledge is undisturbed by anycircumstance. Then why are you not sleeping? Why are you lamenting like thisthroughout the whole night? Dear friend, is it that you are also attracted bythe lotus eyes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and by His sweet smilingand attractive words, exactly as we are? Do those dealings of the SupremePersonality of Godhead pinch your heart as they do ours?" Çréla ViçvanäthaCakravarté Öhäkura has also given mother Yaçodä as an example of anuttama-adhikäré, for mother Yaçodä actually saw all living beings within the mouth of Kåñëa during the Lord's Våndävana lélä.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura also points out in his commentary,atra paçyed iti tathä darçana-yogyataiva vivakñitä, na tu tathä darçanasyasärva-kälikatä. "In this verse the word paçyet, or 'one must see,' does not meanthat at every moment one is visualizing the form of Kåñëa; rather, it meansthat one has reached the exalted platform of devotional service on which he isfit to see or is capable of seeing Kåñëa's form." If only those who constantly seethe form of Kåñëa are to be considered uttama-adhikärés, then Närada, Vyäsaand Çukadeva cannot be considered topmost devotees, since they do notalways see the Lord everywhere. Of course, Närada, Vyäsa and Çukadeva areconsidered to be on the highest standard of pure devotional service, andtherefore the real qualification is tad-didåkñädhikya, or having anoverwhelming desire to see the Lord. Therefore the statement of Bhagavad-gétäthat a devotee should see Kåñëa everywhere (yo mäà paçyati sarvatra) can beunderstood in terms of the example of a lusty man's thinking that the world isfull of beautiful women. Similarly, one should become transcendentally sodesirous of seeing the Lord that one can perceive within the entire universenothing but Kåñëa and His potency. Väsudevaù sarvam iti [Bg. 7.19]. In ÇrélaPrabhupäda's correspondence in 1969 with Professor J. F. Staal of theUniversity of California, Çréla Prabhupäda claimed that all of his disciples whowere strictly following the intense program of Kåñëa consciousness were in factsudurlabha-mahätmäs who were seeing väsudevaù sarvam. In other words, ifone is constantly engaged in Kåñëa consciousness with an intense desire toplease the Lord and one day gain His association, it is to be understood that inone's life there is nothing but Kåñëa. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura haswarned us, however, that a mere theoretical or academic understanding thatKåñëa is everything does not qualify one as a first-class devotee. One mustactually have developed love for Kåñëa. Therefore it can be practicallyunderstood that anyone who enthusiastically adopts the Kåñëa consciousnessprogram and eagerly participates in the preaching activities of theInternational Society for Krishna Consciousness is acting on the platform of amadhyama-adhikäré devotee. When such a devotee becomes overwhelmed byhis desire to serve Kåñëa and associate with the Lord, so much so that he is notattracted to anything else within the universe, he should be understood to bean uttama-adhikäré Vaiñëava, as mentioned in this verse.</div>

<div class="Translation"> An intermediate or second-class devotee, called madhyama-adhikäré, offers his love to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is a sincere friend to all the devotees of the Lord, shows mercy to ignorant people who are innocent and disregards those who are envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to Bhagavad-gétä, every living entity within the material world iseternally a minute fragmental portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Mamaiväàço jéva-loke jéva-bhütaù sanätanaù (Bg. 15.7). But because of theinfluence of mäyä the puffed-up conditioned souls become inimical to theservice of the Lord and the Lord's devotees, choose leaders among thematerialistic sense gratifiers, and thus engage busily in a useless society of thecheaters and the cheated, a society of the blind leading the blind into a ditch.Although the community of Vaiñëavas is sincerely eager to serve theconditioned souls by bringing them back to their constitutional position, bymäyä's influence the materialistic living entity becomes hardhearted and rejects the mercy of the Lord's devotees.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, although asecond-class devotee is eager to preach to the innocent conditioned souls, heshould avoid the atheistic class of men so that he will not become disturbed orpolluted by their association. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura hasconfirmed that a Vaiñëava should be indifferent to those who are envious ofthe Supreme Lord. It is practically seen that when such persons are informedof the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they attempt to ridiculethe Supreme Lord, thus further deteriorating their polluted existence. In thisconnection Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has quoted from the Tenth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (10.20.36):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">girayo mumucus toyaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kvacin na mumucuù çivam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yathä jïänämåtaà käle</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">jïänino dadate na vä</div>
<div class="First">"Sometimes in autumn the water falls down from the tops of the hills to supplyclean water, and sometimes the water stops. Similarly, sometimes great saintlypersons distribute clear knowledge, and sometimes they are silent."In this regard, Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has mentioned that although thefirst-class devotee of the Lord may at times exhibit apparent hatred toward thedemons because of entering the mood of the Lord's pastimes, the intermediatedevotees should avoid such feelings. Furthermore, the intermediate devoteeshould not in any way associate with the powerful atheistic class of men,because there is danger that his mind will become bewildered by suchassociation. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, if a Vaiñëavapreacher encounters one who is envious of him, the preacher should remainfar away from such an envious person. But the Vaiñëava preacher maymeditate upon ways to save the envious class of men. Such meditation is calledsad-äcära, or saintly behavior. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has mentioned PrahlädaMahäräja as an example of a saintly person. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam (7.9.43) there is the following statement by Prahläda:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">naivodvije para duratyaya-vaitaraëyäs</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tvad-vérya-gäyana-mahämåta-magna-cittaù</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">sukhäya bharam udvahato vimüòhän</div>
<div class="First">"O best of the great personalities, I am not at all afraid of material existence,for wherever I stay I am fully absorbed in thought of Your glories andactivities. My concern is only for the fools and rascals who are makingelaborate plans for material happiness and maintaining their families, societiesand countries. I am simply concerned with love for them." Although aVaiñëava preacher constantly meditates on the welfare of all living entities, hewill not associate with those who are unreceptive to the message of theSupreme Lord, Kåñëa. In this regard Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkurastates that even Bharata Mahäräja, Vyäsadeva and Çukadeva Gosvämé do not exhibit their mercy indiscriminately.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has given an elaborateexplanation to prove that the discrimination employed by amadhyama-adhikäré preacher does not at all show a lack of mercy. He statesthat upekñä, or neglect, as mentioned in this verse, is the proper medicine forthose who are inimical to the Supreme Lord and His devotees. Indifferencefrom the preacher checks feelings of hostility on both sides. Although there isa Vedic injunction that one should cut out the tongue of a person who offendsthe Supreme Lord and His devotees, in this age it is best simply to avoidpotential offenders and thus prevent them from committing further sinfulactivities against the Vaiñëavas. It is the duty of a Vaiñëava preacher to pointout the futility of any process besides surrendering to the Supreme Lord. Anenvious person, however, will resent such strong preaching by a Vaiñëava anddisrespect him, considering the devotee to be unnecessarily criticizing others.Such a person, who cannot appreciate the mercy of Vaiñëavas, should beneglected. Otherwise, according to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, his cheating mentality will increase day by day.</div>
<div class="First">Those who are not attracted to the saìkértana movement of Çré CaitanyaMahäprabhu and who disrespect the faithful servants of Lord Caitanya,considering their strong statements about the saìkértana movement to beobstacles to their own worship of the Lord, will never be able to fix their mindson Kåñëa, but will gradually fall down from the path of devotion by confusingthe external activities of the material world with the actual worship of theSupreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Such bewilderment has beenexpressed by the words bhayaà dvitéyäbhiniveçataù syät.Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has strongly rejected those foolishpersons who, under a plea of mercy and equal vision, perceive that a faithlessperson is also a devotee of the Supreme Lord and who thus try to thrust thehari-näma, or holy name of God, upon such offensive people. ÇrélaBhaktisiddhänta has stated, "When childish people think themselvesmahä-bhägavatas and act in defiance of the Vaiñëava spiritual master, suchbehavior simply holds them back from receiving the mercy of the Vaiñëavaguru. Bewildered by false ego, these self-proclaimed devotees gradually becomefit to be ignored by pure devotees on the intermediate platform and arecheated of the mercy that comes from the devotees' satisfaction. Thus theybecome asädhu by constantly committing offenses against the devotees whopreach the holy name of Kåñëa. Pure devotees, therefore, in all circumstancesdisplay indifference to those who falsely imagine themselves to beviçuddha-bhaktas, or pure devotees of the Lord. This indifference is anexcellent manifestation of their mercy." In other words, those who criticize theVaiñëava preachers on the second-class platform for discriminating betweenthose who are fit to receive the Lord's mercy and those who are simply enviousare misunderstanding the mission of the Lord. Kåñëa Himself states in Bhagavad-gétä (4.8):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">pariträëäya sädhünäà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">vinäçäya ca duñkåtäm</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">dharma-saàsthäpanärthäya</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sambhavämi yuge yuge</div>
<div class="First">"To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablishthe principles of religion, I advent Myself millennium after millennium." Evensuch a great Vaiñëava as Çukadeva Gosvämé, one of the twelve mahäjanas inthis universe, expressed his contempt for the evil Kaàsa.Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has pointed out that even though the mahä-bhägavatadevotee may act on the second-class platform for preaching, his rejection ofthe envious living entities does not obstruct his vision of the Lord asall-pervading. Rather, when a first-class devotee or even a second-class devoteerejects the atheistic class of men, he is expressing the mission of the SupremePersonality of Godhead. A first-class or second-class Vaiñëava never actuallybecomes envious of another living entity, but out of intense love for theSupreme Lord he becomes angry when the Lord is offended. Also,understanding the Lord's mission, he discriminates according to the position ofa particular living entity. To consider such a Vaiñëava preacher an ordinary,envious person, or to consider him sectarian because of his proclamation ofpure devotional service as the most exalted of all methods of spiritualadvancement, reflects a materialistic vision called vaiñëave jäti-buddhiù orguruñu nara-matiù. Such an offense drags the offender down to a hellish condition of life by the laws of nature.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, although a mahä-bhägavata sees everyliving entity as a pure spirit soul, such a mahä-bhägavata still experiencesspecial ecstasies and other symptoms upon meeting another Vaiñëava. This isnot contradictory to his vision as a topmost devotee; rather, it is a symptom ofhis love for Kåñëa. A pure devotee sees every living entity as part and parcel ofKåñëa and therefore expresses his love for Kåñëa through love for all theexpansions and creations of Kåñëa. Still, such a mahä-bhägavata feels specialecstatic love upon seeing another living entity directly pleasing the senses ofthe Supreme Lord. Such feelings are manifest in the statement of Lord Çiva to the Pracetäs:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kñaëärdhenäpi tulaye</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na svargaà näpunar-bhavam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhagavat-saìgi-saìgasya</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">martyänäà kim utäçiñaù</div>
<div class="First">"If one by chance associates with a devotee, even for a fraction of a moment,he no longer is subject to attraction by the results of karma or jïäna. Whatinterest then can he have in the benedictions of the demigods, who are subjectto the laws of birth and death?" (SB 4.24.57) Similarly, Lord Çiva also stated:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">atha bhägavatä yüyaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">priyäù stha bhagavän yathä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na mad bhägavatänäà ca</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">preyän anyo 'sti karhicit</div>
<div class="First">"You are all devotees of the Lord, and as such I appreciate that you are asrespectable as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. I know that inthis way the devotees also respect me and that I am dear to them. Thus no onecan be as dear to the devotees as I am." (SB 4.24.30) Similarly, in the FirstCanto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.7.11) Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé is mentioned asnityaà viñëu-jana-priyaù, especially dear to the pure devotees of the Lord.The wonderful loving dealings between Vaiñëavas on the topmost platformare demonstrated in the pastimes of Caitanya-caritämåta. In other words,although a Vaiñëava sees every living entity as part and parcel of Kåñëa, hemust discriminate in his external behavior so as not to interfere with theoriginal purpose of the Lord's creation, which is to reform the living entities sothat they can gradually come back home, back to Godhead. A pure devoteedoes not foolishly pretend equal vision and approach envious persons; rather,he respects the mission of the Lord, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä (4.11) by thewords ye yathä mäà prapadyante täàs tathaiva bhajämy aham.On the other hand, if it is the Lord's desire, a pure devotee can offer hisrespects to all living beings. For example, Çréla Jéva Gosvämé mentions thatUddhava and other pure devotees of the Lord were always prepared to offerrespectful obeisances even to such persons as Duryodhana.Madhyama-adhikärés, however, should not imitate such uttama-adhikärébehavior. In this connection, the distinction between madhyama-adhikäré anduttama-adhikäré is stated by Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura as follows:atra sarva-bhüteñu bhagavad-darçana-yogyatä yasya kadäcid api na dåñöä. Amadhyama-adhikäré cannot at any time perceive the presence of the SupremeLord within all living beings, whereas an uttama-adhikäré, however he acts onthe second-class platform to carry out the Lord's mission, is aware that everyliving entity is ultimately a forgetful Kåñëa conscious living entity. Therefore,although a devotee may externally engage four different types of behavior, asmentioned in this verse—namely, worship of the Lord, friendship with thedevotees, preaching to the innocent and rejection of the demons—he is notnecessarily on the second-class platform, since an uttama-adhikäré also mayexhibit these symptoms to carry out the Lord's mission. In this regard, ÇrélaBhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura mentions that it is the duty of themadhyama-adhikäré to extend himself as the right hand of the uttama-adhikäré,vowing to work for the benefit of others and offering to help in distributing love of Kåñëa.</div>
<div class="First">Finally, Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has given a niceexplanation of the difference between arcana and bhajana. Arcana refers tothe platform of sädhana-bhakti, in which one serves the Lord to carry out therules and regulations of the process. One who has achieved the shelter of theLord's holy name and is totally engaged in the attempt to serve the Lord shouldbe considered to be on the platform of bhajana, even though his externalactivities may sometimes be less strict than those of the neophyte engaged inarcana. This apparent lack of strictness, however, refers to laxity not in thebasic principles of sane behavior and renunciation of sense gratification, but rather in the details of Vaiñëava ceremonies.</div>

<div class="Translation"> A devotee who faithfully engages in the worship of the Deity in the temple but does not behave properly toward other devotees or people in general is called a präkåta-bhakta, a materialistic devotee, and is considered to be in the lowest position.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Madhväcärya comments that one in the lowest stage of devotionalservice faithfully worships the Deity in the temple but is not aware that theSupreme Personality of Godhead is actually all-pervading. This same mentalitycan be seen in the Western countries, where people commit all types of sinfulactivities in their homes and in the street but then piously go to a church andpray to God for mercy. Actually, God is in our home, God is in the street, Godis in our office, God is in the forest, God is everywhere, and therefore Godshould be worshiped everywhere by the process of devotional service at His</div>

<div class="First">"A devotee should not see anything as being separate from the SupremePersonality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Ether, fire, air, water, earth, the sun and otherluminaries, all living beings, the directions, trees and other plants, the riversand oceans—whatever a devotee experiences he should consider to be anexpansion of Kåñëa. Thus seeing everything that exists within creation as thebody of the Supreme Lord, Hari, the devotee should offer his sincere respectsto the entire expansion of the Lord's body." This is the vision of the mahä-bhagavata devotee of the Lord.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Madhväcärya states that a madhyama-adhikäré, a devotee in theintermediate stage, sees the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the cause of allcauses and therefore offers his love to the Lord. Such a devotee is a sincerefriend of other devotees, is merciful to the ignorant and avoids the atheists.Nonetheless, tad-vaçatvaà na jänäti sarvasya jagato 'pi tu: his realization of theall-pervading feature of the Supreme Lord is imperfect. Although he does havea general sense that everyone is ultimately meant to be a devotee of theSupreme Lord and he tries to use everything in the service of Kåñëa, awarethat everything belongs to the Lord, he may be bewildered by association with atheistic men.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Madhväcärya states, arcäyäm eva saàsthitam/ viñëum jïätvätad-anyatra naiva jänäti yaù pumän. A kaniñöha-adhikäré has no idea that theSupreme Lord has the power to exist outside a church or temple. Furthermore,being puffed up by his own ceremonial worship (ätmano bhakti-darpataù), akaniñöha-adhikäré cannot imagine that anyone is more pious or religious thanhe, and he is not even aware that other devotees are more advanced. Thus hecannot understand the madhyama or uttama standard of devotional service,and sometimes, because of his false pride, he criticizes the more advanceddevotees of the Lord, neglects them or simply has no understanding of theirexalted position as preachers or completely self-realized souls.Another symptom of the kaniñöha-adhikäré is that he is infatuated by thematerial qualifications of so-called great materialistic persons. Having a bodilyconcept of life himself, he is attracted by material opulence and thus minimizesthe position of the Supreme Lord, Viñëu. Such a kaniñöha-adhikäré, therefore,is disturbed if a second-class devotee criticizes the nondevotees of the Lord. Inthe name of compassion or kindness, a kaniñöha-adhikäré approves of thenondevotional activities of such materialistic men. Because thekaniñöha-adhikäré is ignorant of the higher realms of devotional service and theunlimited transcendental bliss of Kåñëa consciousness, he sees devotionalservice merely as the religious aspect of life but thinks that life has manyenjoyable and worthwhile nondevotional aspects. Therefore he becomes angrywhen second-class devotees, who are experiencing that Kåñëa is everything,criticize the nondevotees. Madhväcärya says that such a person, because of hisrudimentary faith in Kåñëa, is considered a devotee, but he is bhaktädhama, adevotee on the lowest standard. If such materialistic devotees follow the rulesand regulations of Deity worship, they will gradually be elevated to a higherstandard and eventually become pure devotees of the Lord, unless they commitoffenses against other devotees, in which case their advancement will be checked.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Madhväcärya states, tad-bhaktänäm upekñakäù kuryur viñëäv apidveñam. Those who neglect or show indifference to the devotees of the Lordare to be considered offenders at the lotus feet of Viñëu. Similarly, those whodisrespect the demigods will become bereft of devotional service and be forcedto rotate again and again within saàsära, the cycle of birth and death. Püjyädeväs tataù sadä: the demigods are always to be offered respect, since they aredevotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If someone is envious of thedemigods, he is to be considered envious of the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. Similarly, one who offers sincere respect to the demigods isconsidered to be respecting the will of the Supreme Lord. A Vaiñëava does notfoolishly think that there are many gods. He knows that there is one SupremePersonality of Godhead. But as stated many times in Çrémad-Bhägavatam, theLord has a mission within this material world, which is to reform theconditioned living entities through the cruel laws of nature. In the Lord'smission within this world, the demigods are to be considered limbs of the Lord's body. It is stated in Bhagavad-gétä (7.20):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kämais tais tair håta-jïänäù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">prapadyante 'nya-devatäù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">taà taà niyamam ästhäya</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">prakåtyä niyatäù svayä</div>
<div class="First">"Those whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigodsand follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to theirown natures." But there are many examples of devotees who worshiped thedemigods to get benedictions for serving Lord Kåñëa. The gopés worshiped thedemigods to achieve Kåñëa, and similarly Rukmiëédevé, on the day of hermarriage, engaged in such demigod worship, her only goal being Kåñëa. Eventoday the preachers of the Kåñëa consciousness movement cultivate importantpeople with all kindness and diplomacy so that such wealthy or influentialpeople will engage their resources in the devotional service of Kåñëa to glorifyKåñëa all over the world. Similarly, offering all respects to the demigods so thatthey will give facility for the devotional service of Kåñëa is not against thebhakti-märga, although nowadays such demigod worship has also deteriorated.Therefore, Caitanya Mahäprabhu has recommended hari-näma saìkértana,chanting the holy names of Kåñëa, as the only realistic process for this age.Nonetheless, a devotee of the Lord should not misinterpret Bhagavad-gétä'sinjunctions against demigod worship as a license to offend the demigods, who are bona fide Vaiñëavas.</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">Çréla Madhväcärya notes,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">viñëor upekñakaà sarve</div>

<div class="First">"All the demigods are extremely inimical to one who does not respect LordViñëu. Such a person is pushed into the darkest regions by the Lord, as well asby the demigods." From this statement by Çréla Madhväcärya, the devotionalsentiments of the demigods can be understood. It is stated that in the supremeliberation achieved by an uttama-adhikäré, the most exalted devotee of theLord, the devotee enjoys transcendental bliss in the direct association of the Supreme Lord and the demigods.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, since a kaniñöha-adhikäré who cannotproperly respect other devotees will certainly fail to offer respects to ordinaryliving entities who are not even devotees, a kaniñöha-adhikäré is useless forpractical preaching work unless he comes to a higher platform ofunderstanding. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé says, iyaà ca çraddhä naçästrärthävadhäraëa-jätä. Because the kaniñöha-adhikäré's faith is not actuallybased on the statements of Vedic literature, he cannot understand the exaltedposition of the Supreme Personality of Godhead within everyone's heart.Therefore he cannot actually manifest love of Godhead, nor can heunderstand the exalted position of the devotees of the Lord. Kåñëa is soglorious that Kåñëa's intimate associates must also be glorious. But this isunknown to a kaniñöha-adhikäré. Similarly, the essential qualification of aVaiñëava, which is to offer all respects to others (amäninä manädena kértanéyaùsadä hariù [Cc. Ädi 17.31] is also conspicuous by its absence in akaniñöha-adhikäré. If such a person, however, has faith in the Vedic literaturesand tries to understand the statements of Bhagavad-gétä andÇrémad-Bhägavatam, he will gradually be elevated to the second—and first-class stages of devotional service.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, a kaniñöha-adhikäréshould very seriously engage in regulated worship of the Deity. The Deity is aparticular incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Kåñëa canpresent Himself before the worshiper in five different manifestations, namelyHis original form as Kåñëa (para), His quadruple expansions (vyüha), Hispastime incarnations (vaibhava), the Supersoul (antaryämé) and the Deity(arcä). Within the Deity form (arcä) is the Supersoul, who in turn is includedwithin the Lord's pastime forms (vaibhava). The Supreme Lord'svaibhava-prakäça is an emanation from the catur-vyüha. This quadrupleexpansion of the Lord is situated within the supreme truth, Väsudeva, whoHimself is situated within the svayaà-prakäça-tattva. This svayaà-prakäçaconsists of expansions of the ultimate svayaà-rüpa-tattva, the original form ofKåñëa within Goloka Våndävana in the spiritual sky. This hierarchy of theexpansions of the Supreme Lord in the spiritual world is realized even withinthe material world in terms of one's eagerness to render service to the Lord. Abeginner in the lowest stage of devotional service should try to dedicate all hisactivities to the satisfaction of the Lord and cultivate the worship of Kåñëa in the temple.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, all the plenaryexpansions of the Supreme Lord mentioned above descend into this world andenter within the Deity, who exhibits the function of the Supersoul byaccompanying the daily life of the Vaiñëava. Although the vaibhava, orpastime expansions, of the Lord incarnate at specific times (rämädi-mürtiñukalä-niyamena tiñöhan [Bs. 5.39]), the Supersoul and Deity forms are constantlyavailable for the spiritual advancement of the devotees in this world. As onecomes to the madhyama-adhikäré platform, one is able to understand theexpansions of the Supreme Lord, whereas the kaniñöha-adhikäré's entireknowledge of the Lord is limited to the Deity. Nonetheless, Kåñëa is so kindthat to encourage even the lowest class of Vaiñëavas He condenses all of Hisvarious forms into the Deity so that by worshiping the Deity thekaniñöha-adhikäré devotee is worshiping all the forms of the Lord. As thedevotee makes advancement, he can understand these forms as they appear intheir own way, both within this world and in the spiritual sky.As long as one remains on the third-class platform, one has notranscendental appreciation of the blissful reality of the Supreme Lord'sparaphernalia and entourage. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu was very pleased withKing Pratäparudra when the King, upon receiving an outer cloth from theLord, immediately installed it as a Deity and began to worship it as being asgood as the Lord Himself. Lord Çiva himself has stated, tasmäd parataraà devitadéyänäà samarcanam. Worship of the paraphernalia, entourage or devoteesof the Lord is even better than worship of the Lord, because the Lord is morepleased by worship of His devotees and entourage than by worship of Himself personally.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, the inability of thekaniñöha-adhikäré to appreciate the Lord's devotees, entourage andparaphernalia indicates that such a materialistic Vaiñëava is still affected bythe speculative understanding of the karma-vadés and Mäyävädés, those whoare dedicated to sense gratification and impersonal speculation about theAbsolute. Çréla Prabhupäda often said that only the impersonalist desires to seeKåñëa alone; we desire to see Kåñëa with His cows, His friends, His parents, Hisgopés, His flute, jewelry, forest scenery and so on. Kåñëa is gorgeous in thesetting of Våndävana. It is in the land of Våndävana that Lord Kåñëa,surrounded by so many beautiful associates, manifests His exaltedindescribable beauty. Similarly, the unique mercy of the Supreme Personalityof Godhead is exhibited in the activities of His pure devotees who selflesslytravel around the universe distributing the dust particles from Kåñëa's lotusfeet on the heads of the conditioned souls. One who is uninterested in theLord's paraphernalia, entourage and devotees has a stunted conception of theSupreme Personality of Godhead. This must be due to contamination from the impersonal and sensuous understandings of life.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura states that after hundreds oflifetimes of faithfully worshiping the Deity of Lord Väsudeva with externalparaphernalia, one realizes the true nature of His transcendental name andmantras, and the bondage of one's materialistic mentality slackens. In this way,as a kaniñöha-adhikäré gradually comes to perceive the mental activities of adevotee and tries seriously to advance to a higher stage, his materialisticconceptions will go away of their own accord. He then exhibits loving serviceto the Supreme Personality of Godhead and makes friendship with thedevotees who are the dearmost sons of the Lord, and by appreciating theuniversal quality of devotional service to Kåñëa he becomes very much eager toengage other innocent people in the service of the Lord. Further, as he beginsto make significant advancement he becomes inimical to anything or anyonethat hinders the progress of his devotional life, and thus he avoids atheistic people who cannot benefit by good instruction.</div>
<div class="First">The International Society for Krishna Consciousness, founded by HisDivine Grace Oà Viñëupäda Paramahaàsa Parivräjakäcärya 108 Çré ÇrémadBhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda, is so nice that anyone who helps thissociety immediately engages in preaching work for the Lord. Thus there isgreat facility for the members of this society to come quickly to thesecond-class stage of devotional service. If in the name of Kåñëa consciousnessone gives up preaching and instead becomes interested simply in collectingfunds for maintenance, he is showing a type of envy of other living entities.This is a symptom of the third-class platform. According to Çréla ViçvanäthaCakravarté Öhäkura, verses 45 through 47 constitute the answer to King Nimi'stwo questions "What is the nature of devotional service to the Lord?" and "What are the specific duties of the Vaiñëavas?"</div>

<div class="First">According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, the position of the uttama-adhikäré, orfirst-class devotee of the Lord, is so worshipable that additional symptoms arenow given in eight verses. It should be understood that unless one comes incontact with the lotus feet of a pure devotee of the Lord, the path of freedomfrom material illusion is very difficult to understand. In the fifth verse of ÇréUpadeçämåta Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé has stated, çuçrüñayä bhajana-vijïamananyam anya-nindädi-çünya-hådam épsita-saìga-labdhyä: "One shouldassociate with and faithfully serve that pure devotee who is advanced inundeviated devotional service and whose heart is completely devoid of thepropensity to criticize others." Çréla Prabhupäda comments, "In this verse ÇrélaRüpa Gosvämé advises the devotee to be intelligent enough to distinguishbetween the kaniñöha-adhikäré, madhyama-adhikäré and uttama-adhikäré. Aneophyte Vaiñëava or a Vaiñëava situated on the intermediate platform canalso accept disciples, but such disciples must be on the same platform, and itshould be understood that they cannot advance very well toward the ultimategoal of life under his insufficient guidance. Therefore a disciple should becareful to accept an uttama-adhikäré as a spiritual master." Thereforeadditional symptoms will now be given so that the conditioned soul whodesires to go back home, back to Godhead, can properly identify the bona fide spiritual master.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé and Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, associating witha pure devotee of the Lord is so important that now that the various categoriesof devotional service have been defined, eight additional verses are givenconcerning the qualifications of a pure devotee, so that students ofÇrémad-Bhägavatam will make no mistake in this connection. Similarly, in theSecond Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä Arjuna asked Kåñëa about the symptoms of acompletely Kåñëa conscious person, and Kåñëa elaborately explained thesymptoms of one who is prajïä pratiñöhitä, or established in Kåñëa consciousness.</div>
<div class="First">The particular qualification mentioned in this verse is viñëor mäyäm idaàpaçyan: one should see the entire material universe as a product of the illusoryenergy of the Lord. There is no question of lamenting or rejoicing for thatwhich is the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Within thisworld one generally laments upon losing something desirable and rejoices uponacquiring the object of his wish. But since a pure devotee has no personaldesire whatsoever (kåñëa-bhakta niñkäma-ataeva 'çänta' [Cc. Madhya 19.149]),there is no question of gain or loss. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä (18.54):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">brahma-bhütaù prasannätmä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na çocati na käìkñati</div>

<div class="First">"One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahmanand becomes fully joyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he isequally disposed to every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotionalservice unto Me." Similarly, Lord Çiva says to his wife, Pärvaté, while glorifying</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">the character of King Citraketu,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">näräyaëa-paräù sarve</div>

For them the heavenlyplanets, liberation and the hellish planets are all the same, for such devoteesare interested only in the service of the Lord." (SB 6.17.28)This state of complete satisfaction in the devotional service of Kåñëa is nota mental concoction achieved by artificial meditation, but is a result of havingexperienced the superior nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whois a reservoir of transcendental bliss. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (2.59),rasa-varjaà raso 'py asya paraà dåñövä nivartate. When impersonalists andvoidists artificially try to push material things out of their minds, they undergogreat hardships and ordeals in their artificial meditation.</div>

<div class="First">According to Lord Kåñëa, it is only with great inconvenience and sufferingthat one can achieve impersonal liberation, because every living being iseternally a person, being part and parcel of the Supreme Person, Kåñëa. Theconcept of giving up one's personal identity is a reaction to the terriblefrustration of material egotism. It is not a positive program. If one is sufferingunbearable pain in his hand, he may agree to have the hand amputated, butthe real solution is to remove the infection so that the healthy hand maybecome a source of pleasure. Similarly ego, or the sense that "I am," is a sourceof unlimited happiness when we understand what we are, namely servants ofKåñëa. Impersonal meditation is dry and troublesome. A pure devotee realizesthat he is an eternal person, part and parcel of the Supreme Person, LordKåñëa, and that he has the privilege as the son of God to participate in theecstatic eternal pastimes of the Supreme Lord, loving Kåñëa and playing withHim forever. For such a devotee the pale material nature, which is but aperverted reflection of the spiritual world, becomes totally unattractive.Therefore, one who is completely attached to Kåñëa and uninterested in themanifestations of mäyä can be considered bhägavatottamaù, a pure devotee ofthe Lord, as described in a previous verse (bhaktiù pareçänubhavo viraktir anyatra ca [SB 11.2.42]).</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Madhväcärya has stated, viñëor mäyäà viñëv-icchädhénäm: "The wordsviñëor mäyäm in this verse indicate that the illusory energy always remainsdependent upon the will of Lord Viñëu." Similarly the Brahma-saàhitä (5.44)says, såñöi-sthiti-pralaya-sädhana-çaktir ekä chäyeva yasya bhuvanäni bibhartidurgä. Mäyä is like a shadow of the Supreme Personality of Godhead whoserves Him in the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this world. Just asa shadow has no independent power of movement but follows the substancethat casts the shadow, the illusory energy of the Lord has no independentpower, but bewilders the living entities according to the Lord's desire. One ofKåñëa's opulences is that He is supremely detached; when a living entity wantsto forget Him, Kåñëa immediately employs His illusory energy to facilitate the foolishness of the conditioned soul.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé the words gåhétväpéndriyair arthän indicatethat the pure devotee of the Lord does not cease acting within this world;rather, he uses his senses in the service of the Lord of the senses, Håñékeça.Håñékeëa håñékeça-sevanaà bhaktir ucyate [Cc. Madhya 19.170]. Çréla RüpaGosvämé has stated that if one gives up those material things which arefavorable for serving Kåñëa, considering them material and therefore animpediment to his spiritual advancement, his renunciation is merelyphalgu-vairägya, or immature and imperfect renunciation. On the other hand,one who accepts all material things for the service of Kåñëa without anypersonal desire for sense gratification is actually renounced (yuktaà vairägyam ucyate).</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has warned in his commentary onthis verse that by envying any of the three classes ofdevotees—uttama-adhikäré, madhyama-adhikäré or kaniñöha-adhikäré—one fallsdown to the platform of impersonalism and loses all power to benefit others oreven himself. Therefore those who are trying to advance in Kåñëaconsciousness should not endanger their transcendental experience byunnecessarily criticizing other Vaiñëavas. According to Çréla BhaktisiddhäntaSarasvaté Öhäkura, if one engages in phalgu-vairägya, or renouncing materialthings that are favorable to the service of Lord Kåñëa, one runs the risk ofbeing polluted by impersonal philosophy. On the other hand, by sticking to theprinciple of yukta-vairägya, engaging everything for Kåñëa without personaldesire, one can remain aloof from the danger of material sense gratificationand gradually come to the mahä-bhägavata platform, as mentioned in this verse.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Within the material world, one's material body is always subject to birth and decay. Similarly, the life air [präëa] is harassed by hunger and thirst, the mind is always anxious, the intelligence hankers for that which cannot be obtained, and all of the senses are ultimately exhausted by constant struggle in the material nature. A person who is not bewildered by the inevitable miseries of material existence, and who remains aloof from them simply by remembering the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is to be considered bhägavata-pradhäna, the foremost devotee of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Madhväcärya there are three classes of intelligent livingbeings within this world, namely the demigods, ordinary human beings, anddemons. A living being endowed with all auspicious qualities—in other words,a highly advanced devotee of the Lord—either on the earth or in the higherplanetary systems is called a deva, or demigod. Ordinary human beingsgenerally have good and bad qualities, and according to this mixture theyenjoy and suffer on the earth. But those who are distinguished by their absenceof good qualities and who are always inimical to pious life and the devotional service of the Lord are called asuras, or demons.</div>
<div class="First">Of these three classes, the ordinary human beings and demons are terriblyafflicted by birth, death and hunger, whereas the godly persons, the demigods,are aloof from such bodily distress. The demigods remain aloof from suchdistress because they are enjoying the results of their pious activities; by thelaws of karma, they are unaware of the gross suffering of the material world. As</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">the Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä (9.20),</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">trai-vidyä mäà soma-päù püta-päpä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yajïair iñövä svar-gatià prärthyante</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">te puëyam äsädya surendra-lokam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">açnanti divyän divi deva-bhogän</div>
<div class="First">"Those who study the Vedas and drink the soma juice, seeking the heavenlyplanets, worship Me indirectly. They take birth on the planet of Indra, wherethey enjoy godly delights." But the next verse of Bhagavad-gétä says that whenone uses up the results of these pious activities, one has to forfeit his status as ademigod, along with the pleasure of the heavenly kingdom, and return to earthas a nara, or ordinary human being (kñéëe puëye martya-lokaà viçanti [Bg.9.21]). In fact the laws of nature are so subtle that one may not even return toearth as a human, but may take birth as an insect or tree, depending on the particular configuration of his karma.</div>
<div class="First">The pure devotee of the Lord, however, does not experience materialmisery, because he has given up the bodily concept of life and identifieshimself correctly as an eternal servitor of the Supreme Personality ofGodhead, Kåñëa. As stated by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gétä (9.2),susukhaà kartum avyayam. Even in the stage of regulative practice, the processof bhakti-yoga is very joyful. Similarly, Locana däsa Öhäkura, a nearcontemporary of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, said, saba avatära sära çiromaëikevala änanda-käëòa. Although there are various käëòas, or divisions, of Vedicdiscipline, such as karma-käëòa (fruitive ceremonies) and jïäna-käëòa(regulated speculation), Caitanya Mahäprabhu's hari-näma saìkértanamovement is kevala änanda-käëòa, the pathway of pure bliss. Simply bychanting the holy names of Kåñëa, eating the remnants of sumptuous foodoffered to the Supreme Lord and hearing the enchanting pastimes of thePersonality of Godhead, one merges into an ocean of bliss called Kåñëa consciousness.</div>
<div class="First">Fortunately this blissful ocean is the eternal situation of every living entity,provided he gives up all of his bogus concepts of life. One should not identifyhimself as a gross material body, nor as a fickle mind, nor as speculativeintelligence, nor should one foolishly identify himself with the so-called voidof Buddhist imagination. Nor should one even identify himself with the oceanof impersonal spiritual life called the brahmajyoti, which illuminates the greatoutdoors of the spiritual sky beyond the covered universe. One should ratheridentify himself correctly as an eternal individual servant of the supremeindividual Personality of Godhead. By this simple admission of one'sconstitutional position and by sincere engagement in the service of the lotusfeet of the Lord, one is quickly promoted to direct participation in the eternalpastimes of Kåñëa, just as Arjuna got the opportunity to play with Kåñëa as a soldier on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Madhväcärya has given an elaborate description of the process bywhich material miseries arise. When a conditioned soul of demoniac mentalityidentifies himself with the gross material body, he undergoes miseries ofconstant drowsiness and unquenchable sexual desires that burn all mentalpeace and serenity to ashes. When a demoniac person identifies himself withpräëa, the life air, he suffers from hunger, and by identifying himself with themind he suffers panic, fear, and hankering that ends in disappointment. Whenhe identifies himself with intelligence, he suffers profound existentialbitterness and frustration deep within his heart. When he identifies himselfwith the false ego, he feels inferiority, thinking, "I am so low." And when heidentifies himself with the process of consciousness, he is haunted by memoriesof the past. When a demon tries to impose himself as the ruler of all living beings, all of these miseries expand simultaneously.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çrépäda Madhväcärya, sinful life is the demoniac standard forhappiness. We can observe that in demoniac societies the dark, late hours ofnight are considered most appropriate for recreational activity. When a demonhears that someone is rising at four o'clock in the morning to take advantage ofthe godly early-morning hours, he is astonished and bewildered. Therefore it is</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">said in Bhagavad-gétä (2.69),</div>

<div class="First">"What is night for all beings is the time of awakening for the self-controlled;and the time of awakening for all beings is night for the introspective sage."Çréla Prabhupäda has commented, "There are two classes of intelligent men.The one is intelligent in material activities for sense gratification, and theother is introspective and awake to the cultivation of self-realization." Thusthe more one can increase illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling,the more one advances his prestige in a demoniac society, whereas in a godlysociety based on Kåñëa consciousness these things are abolished completely.Similarly, as one becomes blissfully attached to the holy name and pastimes ofKåñëa, one becomes more and more alienated from the demoniac society.The demons are self-proclaimed enemies of the Supreme Lord, and theymock His kingdom. Thus they are described by Çréla Madhväcärya asadho-gateù, or those who have purchased their tickets to the darkest regions ofhell. On the other hand, if one is undisturbed by the miseries of material life,he is on the same spiritual level as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">stated in Bhagavad-gétä (2.15),</div>

<div class="First">"O best among men [Arjuna], the person who is not disturbed by happiness anddistress and is steady in both is certainly eligible for liberation." One can cometo this transcendental stage only by the mercy of the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. In the words of Çré Madhväcärya, sampürëänugrahäd viñëoù.Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has described the process bywhich one becomes an uttama-adhikäré If one is fortunate, he graduallybecomes disgusted with the limited vision and activities of thekaniñöha-adhikäré and learns to appreciate the expanded vision of themadhyama-adhikäré, who is able to recognize that every living entity shouldbecome a devotee of Kåñëa and that one achieves the perfection of life byfollowing in the footsteps of an uttama-adhikäré devotee of the Lord. As one'sdevotional service gradually intensifies and one repeatedly bathes in dust fromthe lotus feet of a pure devotee, the harassment of birth, death, hunger, thirst,fear and so on gradually cease disturbing the mind. As stated in</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu (1.2.114),</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">alabdhe vä vinañöe vä</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">aviklava-matir bhütvä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">harim eva dhiyä smaret</div>
<div class="First">"Even if a devotee is frustrated in his attempt to eat properly or clothe himselfproperly, he should not allow this material failure to disturb his mind; rather,he should use his intelligence to remember his master, Lord Kåñëa, and thusremain undisturbed." As one becomes mature in this process of rememberingKåñëa in all circumstances, he is awarded the title mahä-bhägavata.Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta gives the example that just as a child's ball may befastened to the end of a rope so that it cannot bounce away, a devotee whosurrenders to Kåñëa becomes tied to the rope of Vedic injunctions and is neverlost in worldly affairs. In this connection Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta SarasvatéÖhäkura has quoted from the Åg Veda (1.156.3) as follows: oà äsya jänantonäma cid vivaktan mahas te viñëo su-matià bhajämahe oà tat sat. "O Viñëu,Your name is completely transcendental. Thus it is self-manifest. Indeed, evenwithout properly understanding the glories of chanting Your holy name, if wevibrate Your name with at least a small understanding of its glories—that is, ifwe simply repeat the syllables of Your holy name—gradually we shallunderstand it." The supreme entity indicated by the praëava oà is sat, orself-revealing. Therefore, even if one is disturbed by fear or envy, thetranscendental form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead will becomemanifest to one who continues to chant the Lord's holy name. Further evidence is given in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (6.2.14):</div>

<div class="Translation"> One who has taken exclusive shelter of the Supreme Lord, Väsudeva, becomes free from fruitive activities, which are based on material lust. In fact, one who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord is freed from even the desire to enjoy material sense gratification. Plans for enjoying sex life, social prestige and money cannot develop within his mind. Thus he is considered bhägavatottama, a pure devotee of the Lord on the highest platform.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, this verse describes the behavior of adevotee of the Lord. The activities of a pure devotee are devoid of materialenvy, false elation, delusion and lust. According to the Vaiñëavacommentators, the word béjänäm in this verse refers to väsanäù, or deeplyrooted desires, which gradually fructify in the form of activities, for which theliving entity becomes subject to reactions. Thus the compound wordkäma-karma-béjänäm indicates the deep-rooted desire to lord it over thematerial world through the enjoyment of sexual pleasure and the expansions ofsexual pleasure mentioned in the Bhägavatam (5.5.8) asgåha-kñetra-sutäpta-vittaiù, that is, a beautiful residential building and ampleland for producing sumptuous food to fill the belly, as well as children, friends,social contacts and a large bank balance. All of these material items areessential for completely forgetting that one is an eternal servant of theSupreme Lord. Therefore as stated in the Bhägavatam, janasya moho 'yamahaà mameti: [SB 5.5.8] intoxicated by these objects of material illusion, theconditioned soul becomes madly convinced that he is the center of theuniverse and that everything in existence has been created only for hispersonal sense gratification. Whoever obstructs such illusory enjoymentbecomes immediately his enemy and subject to be killed.Because of this bodily concept of life and the shackles of illusion, the wholeworld is being violently shaken by conflict arising from envy and lust. Theonly possible solution is to accept the leadership of the Lord's pure devotees,who are described here. A popular expression used to justify democraticgovernment is "Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely." Suchhomilies may be valid on the material platform, but it is specifically mentionedhere that a pure devotee of the Lord who has completely taken shelter of theLord's lotus feet cannot even consider taking part in material envy and sensegratification. His mind remains perpetually clear and sober, and he is alwaysaware of the ultimate good of every living entity. The Kåñëa consciousnessmovement is strenuously endeavoring to inform the earth's suffering livingentities of the serious need for a brain in human society. A brain racked byfever cannot give proper direction, and if the so-called thinkers of society areburning with selfish desires, they are no better than feverish, delirious brains.Delirious governments are gradually destroying all traces of happiness inhuman society. Therefore it is the duty of Vaiñëava preachers to act on theplatform of bhägavatottama so that they can give clear guidance to humanity,without being corrupted or even slightly attracted by the material opulencethat may be offered to a saintly person. All intelligent human beings who areunable to take directly to the process of bhakti-yoga should at least besufficiently educated to recognize the first-class devotee of the Lord and accepthis guidance. In this way human society can be very nicely organized so thatnot only all human beings but even the animals, birds and trees can makeadvancement in life and gradually go back home, back to Godhead, for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has emphasized that thoseseriously interested in achieving the perfection of Kåñëa consciousness mustlive in a community of Vaiñëavas. Çréla Prabhupäda has also mentioned severaltimes in his literature that it is not possible to achieve the stage of perfectKåñëa consciousness unless one accepts the shelter of the pure devotees byliving in the Kåñëa conscious communities being established all over the worldby the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. Çréla BhaktisiddhäntaSarasvaté Öhäkura has emphasized that this does not mean that spiritual life isrestricted only to those celibate students who can live within a templecompound. Devotees in the gåhastha order, that of spiritual family life, can alsotake shelter of the Vaiñëava community by regularly attending templefunctions. Those who are living in family life should daily see the Deity of theSupreme Lord, chant His holy names in His personal presence, accept theremnants of food offered to the Deity and hear learned discourses onBhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Any householder who regularly takesadvantage of these spiritual facilities and follows the regulative principles ofspiritual life, namely no meat-eating, no illicit sex, no gambling and nointoxication, is to be considered a bona fide member of the Vaiñëavacommunity. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, those whoremain inimical to the devotional service of the Lord are to be consideredlifeless puppets in the hands of the illusory energy of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Birth in an aristocratic family and the execution of austere and pious activities certainly cause one to take pride in himself. Similarly, if one enjoys a prestigious position within society because his parents are highly respected members of the varëäçrama social system, one becomes even more infatuated with himself. But if despite these excellent material qualifications one does not feel even a tinge of pride within himself, he is to be considered the dearmost servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, the word janma ("good birth") refers tosuch classes as the mürdhävasiktas (children of brähmaëa fathers and kñatriyamothers) and ambañöhas (children of brähmaëa fathers and vaiçya mothers),both of which are considered anuloma since the father comes from a highercaste. Marriages in which the mother comes from a higher class than thefather are called pratiloma. In any case, one who becomes proud of his so-calledprestigious birth is certainly in the bodily concept of life. Birth in any materialbody is a serious problem, which one should solve by surrendering to theSupreme Personality of Godhead. One can thereby release himself from thegolden shackles of a so-called aristocratic material body.According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, kaniñöha-adhikärésthink that karma-miçra bhakti, or devotional service mixed with materialendeavor, is the ultimate in spiritual life. They become attached to verses such as this:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">varëäçramäcära-vatä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">puruñeëa paraù pumän</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">viñëur ärädhyate panthä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nänyat tat-toña-käraëam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">[Cc. Madhya 8.58]</div>
<div class="First">"The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viñëu, is worshiped by the properexecution of prescribed duties in the system of varëa and äçrama. There is noother way to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One must besituated in the institution of the four varëas and äçramas." (Viñëu Puräëa3.8.9) Thus they think that material work in which a portion of the fruits areoffered to God forms the highest platform of human life. According to ÇrélaBhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, there are several småti literatures thathave encouraged such mixed devotional service. Such books are taken bymaterialistic devotees as facility for offending the holy name of the Lordbecause of egotistic attachment to the material body. Thus one thinks that aprestigious position in the varëäçrama system according to birth and so-calledpious activities is a prerequisite for becoming successful in life.But those who have actually taken shelter of the holy name of Kåñëa neverboast about their birth in the material world, nor do they pride themselves ontheir so-called expertise in material work. As long as one's mentality isencumbered by the material designations of the varëäçrama system, one hasvery little chance of becoming free from material bondage and establishinghimself as dear to the Lord. In this regard, Caitanya Mahäprabhu emphaticallydeclared that He could not identify Himself with any varëäçrama designation,such as that of a great intellectual or priest, a courageous warrior in the Lord'sarmy, a brilliant businessman making money for the Lord, or the hardestworker for the Lord. Nor could Caitanya Mahäprabhu identify Himself as astalwart brahmacäré, a noble householder or an exalted sannyäsé. Thesedesignations reflect the material pride that can infiltrate the execution ofdevotional service. Although a devotee may carry out the standard duties ofvarëäçrama, his only designation is gopé-bhartuù pada-kamalayordäsa-däsänudäsaù [Cc. Madhya 13.80], the eternal servant of the servant of the servant of the Lord, the master of the gopés, Kåñëa.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, when a devoteeunderstands that the process of bhakti-yoga is complete in itself and hebecomes absorbed in hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord, thesupremely merciful Personality of Godhead affectionately lifts such a first-classdevotee onto His own lap. The Supreme Lord can be pleased only by unalloyeddevotion, and not by any arrangement of the gross body, composed of fivematerial elements, or the subtle body, composed of innumerable speculationsand bogus pride. In other words, Lord Kåñëa can never be pleased by one'sso-called aristocratic body, which is due to be devoured by worms or vultures. Ifone becomes proud of his material birth and so-called pious activities, by suchfalse pride one gradually develops the impersonal mentality of merelyrenouncing the fruit of work or else the karmé mentality of enjoying the fruitsof work. Neither the karmés nor the jïäné speculators are aware that the fruitof work actually belongs to Kåñëa. The conclusion is that one should carefullygive up all false pride and always remember that he is a humble servant ofKåñëa. As stated by Caitanya Mahäprabhu, amäninä mänadena kértanéyaù sadä hariù [Cc. Ädi 17.31].</div>

<div class="First">The vision described by the phrase sarva-bhüta-samaù, "seeing all livingentities equally," does not include one's vision of the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. In this connection Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted from the Haré-vaàça as follows:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na kväpi jévaà viñëutve</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">saàsåtau mokña eva ca</div>
<div class="First">"Under no circumstance should one consider the living entity equal to LordViñëu, either in conditional life or in liberation." The impersonal speculativephilosophers are fond of imagining that although in our present illusion weappear to be individual entities, at liberation we shall all merge into God andbe God. Such wishful thinkers cannot reasonably explain how the omnipotentGod could arrive at the embarrassing position of having to enter a yoga studio,pay weekly fees, press His nose and chant mantras to regain His divinity. Asstated in the Vedas, nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm eko bahünäà yovidadhäti kämän (Kaöha Upaniñad 2.2.13). The individuality or plurality ofliving entities is not a product of material existence. The word nityänäm,denoting the plurality of eternal entities, clearly indicates that the livingentities are eternally individual parts and parcels of the Lord, who is thesingular unique entity described here as ekaù. In Bhagavad-gétä (1.21) Arjunasaid to Kåñëa, rathaà sthäpaya me 'cyuta: "My dear Acyuta, please place mychariot between the armies." This body is also ratha, a vehicle, and thereforethe best policy is to request the infallible Lord to take charge of ourconditioned body and guide us on the path back to the kingdom of God. Theword acyuta means "the infallible" or "one who never falls." Learned or sanehuman beings will not entertain the silly notion that the omnipotent,omniscient God has slipped and fallen because of mäyä. No amount of wishfulthinking can erase our eternal servitorship at the lotus feet of the Lord.This fact is stated by the Lord Himself in the Varäha Puräëa:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">naivaà tvayänumantavyaà</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">sarvair guëair su-sampannaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">daivaà mäà jïätum arhasi</div>
<div class="First">"You should never think Me one of the ordinary living entities in the jévacategory. In fact I am the reservoir of all opulences and godly qualities, andtherefore you should understand that I am the Supreme Lord."According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé and Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura,this verse of Çrémad-Bhägavatam does not forbid using a particular object inthe Lord's service, since a devotee is free to use anything favorable for servingLord Kåñëa. This acceptance of favorable objects in the service of Kåñëa iscalled yukta-vairägya. As stated by Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé, nirbandhaùkåñëa-sambandhe: one should be attached for Kåñëa's sake, never for one's ownsake. If one interprets this verse to indicate that one should not exercisecontrol over any material object, even if it is favorable for serving Kåñëa, onefalls into the bad understanding called phalgu-vairägya, or immaturerenunciation. Great kings such as Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira and Mahäräja Parékñitengaged the entire earth, and other Vaiñëavas have engaged the entireuniverse in the service of Kåñëa. But they completely gave up the sense of theirpersonal proprietorship. That is the point made in this verse. Just as onebecomes very much concerned about any pain in one's own body, one shouldbe concerned with bringing the conditioned souls to the platform ofdevotional service so that all of their suffering will be banished forever. That isthe actual purport of not distinguishing between one body and another.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are sought even by the greatest of demigods, such as Brahmä and Çiva, who have all accepted the Supreme Personality of Godhead as their life and soul. A pure devotee of the Lord can never forget those lotus feet in any circumstance. He will not give up his shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord for a single moment—indeed, not for half a moment—even in exchange for the benediction of ruling and enjoying the opulence of the entire universe. Such a devotee of the Lord is to be considered the best of the Vaiñëavas.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé one may ask, "If one were able to gainthe opulence of the entire universe in exchange for leaving the Lord's lotusfeet for just half a moment, what would be the harm in leaving the Lord's lotusfeet for such an insignificant amount of time?" The answer is given by theword akuëöha-småti. It is simply impossible for a pure devotee to forget thelotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, since everything that exists is in factan expansion of the Supreme Lord. Since nothing is separate from theSupreme Lord, a pure devotee of the Lord cannot think of anything but theLord. Nor can a pure devotee contemplate ruling or enjoying universalopulence; even if given all the opulence of the universe, he would immediatelyoffer it at the lotus feet of the Lord and return to his position of a humble servant of the Lord.</div>
<div class="First">The words ajitätma-surädibhir vimågyät are very significant in this verse.The lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa are so opulent that even the lords of all materialopulence, namely Brahmä and Çiva, as well as the other demigods, are alwayssearching for a glimpse of the Lord's lotus feet. The word vimågyät indicatesthat the demigods are not actually able to see the lotus feet of the Lord, but areendeavoring to see them. An example of this is given in the Tenth Cantowhen Lord Brahmä offers prayers to Viñëu, begging the Lord to rectify the disturbances on the earth.</div>
<div class="First">A similar verse is found elsewhere in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (11.14.14):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na pärameñöhyaà na mahendra-dhiñëyaà</div>

<div class="First">According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the word ajitätmä canalso be taken to mean ajitendriyäù, or "those whose senses are uncontrolled."Although the demigods are all to be respected as devotees of Lord Viñëu, theabsence of gross material discomfort in the higher planetary systems makesthem tend to become affected by the bodily concept of life, and sometimesthey experience some spiritual difficulty due to the gorgeous material facilitiesavailable to them. Such disturbances, however, cannot exist within the mindof a pure devotee of the Lord, as indicated in this verse by the wordakuëöha-småti. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, we canunderstand from this verse that since none of the material facilities availablein any of the universal planetary systems can distract a pure devotee of theLord, such a devotee can never possibly fall or become inimical to the Lord's service.</div>

<div class="Translation"> How can the fire of material suffering continue to burn the hearts of those who worship the Supreme Lord? The Lord's lotus feet have performed innumerable heroic deeds, and the beautiful nails on His toes resemble valuable jewels. The effulgence emanating from those nails resembles cooling moonshine, for it instantly relieves the suffering within the heart of the pure devotee, just as the appearance of the moon's cooling light relieves the burning heat of the sun.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">When the moon rises, the expansion of its rays drives away the distress ofthe sun's fierce heat. Similarly, the cooling rays emanating from the lotus nailsof the Personality of Godhead's lotus feet vanquish all distress for the Lord'spure devotee. According to the Vaiñëava commentators it is to be understoodfrom this verse that material lust, exemplified by uncontrolled sexual desire, isexactly like a blazing fire. The flames of this fire burn to ashes the peace andhappiness of the conditioned soul, who perpetually wanders in 8,400,000species of life, vainly struggling to extinguish this intolerable fire. The puredevotees of the Lord place the Lord's cooling, jewellike lotus feet within theirhearts, and thus all of the pain and suffering of material existence are extinguished.</div>
<div class="First">The word uru-vikramäìghri indicates that the Lord's lotus feet are quiteheroic. Çré Kåñëa is famous for His incarnation as Vämana, the dwarfbrähmaëa, who extended His beautiful toes up to the outer limits of theuniverse and perforated the universal shell, thus bringing the waters of theholy Ganges into the universe. Similarly, when Kåñëa was entering the city ofMathurä to challenge the demoniac King Kaàsa and His entrance wasimpeded by a ferocious elephant named Kuvalayäpéòa, Lord Kåñëa kicked theelephant to death and peacefully entered the city gates. Lord Kåñëa's lotus feetare so exalted that the Vedic literatures state that the entire materialmanifestation rests beneath His lotus feet: samäçrétä ye pada-pallava-plavaà mahat padaà puëya-yaço muräreù (SB 10.14.58).</div>

<div class="Translation"> The Supreme Personality of Godhead is so kind to the conditioned souls that if they call upon Him by speaking His holy name, even unintentionally or unwillingly, the Lord is inclined to destroy innumerable sinful reactions in their hearts. Therefore, when a devotee who has taken shelter of the Lord's lotus feet chants the holy name of Kåñëa with genuine love, the Supreme Personality of Godhead can never give up the heart of such a devotee. One who has thus captured the Supreme Lord within his heart is to be known as bhägavata-pradhäna, the most exalted devotee of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, the essence of a pure devotee'squalifications is given in this verse. A pure devotee is one who has attractedthe Lord by his love so that the Lord cannot give up the devotee's heart.According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the word säkñät in this verse indicates that apure devotee has realized knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,having given his heart to the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, who is all-attractive in sixopulences, including beauty. A pure devotee can never be attracted by thefleshy bags of women's breasts or by the hallucinations of so-called society,friendship and love within the material world. Therefore his clean heartbecomes a suitable abode for the Supreme Lord. A gentleman will live only ina clean place. He will not live in a polluted, contaminated place. Educatedpeople in the Western countries are now greatly protesting the pollution ofwater and air by urban industrial enterprises. People are demanding the rightto live in a clean place. Similarly, Lord Kåñëa is the supreme gentleman, andtherefore He will not live in a polluted heart, nor will He appear within thepolluted mind of a conditioned soul. When a devotee surrenders to Lord Kåñëaand becomes a lover of the Lord by direct realization of Kåñëa's all-attractivenature, the Lord makes His residence in the clean heart and mind of such a pure devotee.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, ya etädåça-praëayaväàs tenänena tusarvadä paramävaçenaiva kértyamänaù sutaräm evam eväghaugha-näçaù syät. If adevotee is absorbed in the loving transcendental service of Kåñëa, directly orindirectly he is always glorifying the Lord by transcendental loving service.Therefore, even if he chants the holy name of Kåñëa with improper attentiondue to being absorbed in the Lord's service, the mercy of the Lord purifies hisheart of all sinful reactions. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (2.1.11):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">etan nirvidyamänänäm</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">icchatäm akuto-bhayam</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">harer nämänukértanam</div>
<div class="First">"O King, constant chanting of the holy name of the Lord after the ways of thegreat authorities is the doubtless and fearless way of success for all, includingthose who are free from all material desires, those who are desirous of allmaterial enjoyment, and also those who are self-satisfied by dint oftranscendental knowledge." Therefore if one who has not come to the platformof loving devotional service chants the holy name of Kåñëa, he will also begradually freed from all sinful reactions. In the Sixth Canto ofÇrémad-Bhägavatam, in the purports to the history of Ajämila, ÇrélaPrabhupäda has elaborately explained the holy name's potency to purify even an ordinary person.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has nicely explained the process ofbringing the Supreme Lord under control. Mother Yaçodä bound the childKåñëa to a grinding mortar with a rope. Kåñëa, being attracted by theinconceivable love of His devotees, allowed Himself to be bound. Therefore,although Lord Kåñëa binds all the conditioned souls by the chains of Hisillusory potency, mäyä, if those same conditioned souls become pure devoteesof the Lord they can in turn bind Kåñëa by the chains of love of God.According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, all the world'sinauspicious conditions due to sinful activities can be immediately eradicatedby the chanting of the Lord's holy name. The Supreme Personality of Godheadnever leaves the hearts of those who give up all sinful behavior and chant Hisholy name. Even if such chanting is not yet perfect, devotee who alwaysremains in the Lord's service will gradually come to the stage of prema-niñöhä,or steady love of Godhead. Then they are to be considered mahä-bhägavatas, or pure devotees of the Lord.</div>
<div class="First">Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Second Chapter, of theÇrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Mahäräja Nimi Meets the Nine Yogendras."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">3. Liberation from the Illusory Energy</div>
<div class="First">In answer to four questions spoken by Mahäräja Nimi, this chapterdescribes the nature and activities of the illusory potency (mäyä), the methodof becoming free from mäyä's insurmountable grip, the transcendentalsituation of the Supreme Lord Näräyaëa, and the process of karma-yoga, by which one becomes free from all material activities.</div>
<div class="First">The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the original cause of all causes,created the five material elements, from which the material bodies of theconditioned souls are created so that the conditioned souls may cultivateeither sense gratification or ultimate liberation. Appearing as the Supersoul,the Supreme Lord enters the material bodies of the created beings andactivates the eleven senses of the conditioned souls. The conditioned soulmisidentifies the created material body with his actual self and thus engages invarious fruitive activities. Impelled by the reactions of his own activities, herepeatedly takes birth in various species of life and thus suffers greatly untilthe time of the cosmic annihilation. When the annihilation is imminent, thesoul of the universal form withdraws the entire material creation withinHimself, and then He Himself enters into the original cause of all causes. Inthis way the Lord empowers His illusory potency, consisting of the three modesof material nature, for the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the material universe.</div>
<div class="First">Accepting the roles of male and female in this material world, theconditioned souls unite in sexual relationships. Although these soulsconstantly make material endeavors to eliminate their unhappiness andunlimitedly increase their pleasure, they inevitably achieve exactly the opposite result.</div>
<div class="First">Permanent happiness cannot be found in this world-either on the earthlyplanets or on the heavenly planets, which one can attain in the next life afterperforming ritualistic ceremonies and sacrifices. Both on earth and in heaventhe living entity is harassed by the envy and rivalry of others.Therefore any person who seriously desires. to find permanent relief fromthe sufferings of material existence should take shelter of the lotus feet of abona fide spiritual master. The qualification of the bona fide guru is that hehas realized the conclusions of the Vedic scriptures by deliberation and is ableto convince others of these conclusions. Such great personalities, who havetaken shelter of the Supreme Godhead, leaving aside all materialconsiderations, should he understood to be bona fide spiritual masters.Accepting the bona fide spiritual master as one's life and soul, thesubmissive disciple should learn from him the process of pure devotionalservice, which satisfies the Supreme Lord. By thus following the path ofdevotional service, the disciple gradually develops all good qualities.One should hear, glorify and meditate upon the wonderful transcendentalactivities, appearance, qualities and holy names of the Lord. Whatever onefinds pleasing or enjoyable he should immediately offer to the Supreme Lord;even his wife, children, home and very life air should all be offered at the lotusfeet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should serve others and alsoaccept instructions from others. Especially, one should serve and learn fromthose who are pure devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.By chanting the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in theassociation of devotees, one becomes satisfied and happy and develops a lovingfriendship with the devotees. In this way one becomes able to give up materialsense gratification, which is the cause of all suffering. When a devotee attainsthe stage of pure love of Godhead, the hairs of his body stand on end, and hemanifests various ecstatic symptoms; he personally meets the Supreme Lordand becomes full of transcendental bliss. By learning the science of devotionalservice and practically engaging in the devotional service of the Lord, thedevotee comes to the stage of love of Godhead. When completely devoted tothe Supreme Personality of Godhead, Näräyaëa, the devotee easily crossesover the illusory energy, mäyä, which is extremely difficult to cross.The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of the creation,maintenance and destruction of the universe, yet He has no prior cause.Situated within the temporary and constantly changing material world, theSupreme Lord remains eternal and unchanging. He cannot be understood bythe unaided mind or senses, and He is transcendental to the manifestation ofthe material world, which takes place as the subtle cause and material effectvisible in the appearance of gross material objects. Although He is originallyone, by expanding His illusory potency (mäyä) He appears in many differentforms. He is always free from birth, growth, decay and death, and He is theSupersoul, the all-pervading witness who perceives the mentalities of all livingentities. He is the Supreme Brahman and is known as Näräyaëa.When one seriously engages in devotional service to the lotus feet of LordNäräyaëa, the impure desires lodged within one's heart as a result of one'sprevious work within the three modes of material nature are destroyed. Whenthe heart is thus purified, one can directly perceive both the Supreme Lord and one's self as transcendental entities.</div>
<div class="First">Through authorized study of the transcendental Vedic literature, one canproperly understand the meaning of prescribed duties, nonperformance ofsuch duties, and forbidden activities. This difficult subject matter can never beunderstood by mundane speculation. Vedic injunctions indirectly lead one tothe path of ultimate liberation by first prescribing fruitive religious activities,just as a father promises his child candy so that the child will take hismedicine. If an ignorant person who has not conquered the material sensesdoes not perform the Vedic injunctions, he will certainly engage in sinful andirreligious activities. Thus his reward will be repeated birth and death. On theother hand, if one executes the regulated activities prescribed in the Vedas,without attachment, and offers the result of such work to the Supreme Lord,one attains perfect freedom from the bondage of material work. The materialfruitive results offered in the revealed scriptures are not the actual goal ofVedic knowledge, but are meant for stimulating the interest of the performer.If a conditioned soul worships the Supreme Lord Hari by following theregulations found in Vedic literatures such as the tantras, he will quickly become free from the bondage of false ego.</div>
<div class="First">When a devotee obtains the mercy of his spiritual master, who reveals tohim the injunctions of Vedic scriptures, he worships the Supreme Personalityof Godhead in the particular personal form he finds most attractive. In thisway the devotee quickly becomes liberated from all material bondage.</div>

<div class="First">According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, in this chapter various saintly sons ofÅñabhadeva will speak about the illusory energy (mäyä), the means for crossingbeyond it, the characteristics of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, andprescribed duties for human beings. The forty-eighth verse of the previouschapter stated, viñëor mäyäm idaà paçyan: "A devotee of Kåñëa should see theentire universe to be the illusory potency of the Lord." Therefore King Nimi isnow pursuing this subject matter by requesting more detailed information from the saintly Yogendras.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, the demigods,headed by Lord Brahmä, and the human beings of the earth are all driven bytheir particular desires for material sense gratification. Thus they direct theirsenses toward research for material knowledge. The subtle celestial senses ofthe demigods and the gross senses of human beings are all busy in ascertainingthe measurements of material sense objects. To understand fully the actualnature of mäyä, the illusory potency, which causes the conditioned souls tobecome averse to Kåñëa consciousness and surrender to bewildering materialmanifestations, King Nimi is inquiring from another of the nine Yogendras, Çré Antarékña.</div>

<div class="First">According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, one may argue that since the symptomsof a pure devotee of the Lord have already been elaborately described, one canperfect his life by advancing to the platform mentioned in the previous verse,and there is no need for further questions. But hari-kathämåtam, topics aboutthe Lord and His devotees, are so pleasing and beautiful that one cannot giveup hearing them, even after spiritual liberation. Caitanya Mahäprabhu, in this connection, has quoted the following verse:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ätmärämäç ca munayo</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nirgranthä apy urukrame</div>

Hari, the Personality ofGodhead, is called Kåñëa because He has such transcendentally attractivefeatures." (SB 1.7.10) Material medicine is not desirable once a disease has beencured, but on the absolute platform the means and the end are not different.So chanting and hearing the glories of Lord Kåñëa are both the means and the end of transcendental bliss.</div>
<div class="First">King Nimi said to the sages, "You are all great saintly persons absorbed inlove of Godhead.

The intoxicating nectar ofyour instructions has left me more eager than ever to hear about the Supreme Personality of Godhead."</div>
<div class="First">King Nimi was also a great devotee of the Lord, otherwise there would havebeen no question of his personally conversing with such exalted living entitiesas the nine Yogendras.

<div class="First">According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the illusory energy(mäyä) is explained in this verse through a description of her potencies,namely the modes of material nature. In Bhagavad-gétä Lord Kåñëa hasdescribed mäyä as guëamayé, "consisting of the material modes of nature." Thematerial modes of nature are alluded to in this verse by the word uccävacäni,"high and low species of life." Various species of life become manifest, as dovarieties of beauty, ugliness, strength, weakness and other characteristicswithin a particular species, according to the proportionate development of themodes of nature. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä (13.22), käraëaà guëa-saìgo'sya sad-asad-yoni-janmasu: "This is due to the living being's association withmaterial nature in good and evil species." Similarly we find this statement:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ürdhvaà gacchanti sattva-sthä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">madhye tiñöhanti räjasäù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">jaghanya-guëa-våtti-sthä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">adho gacchanti tämasäù</div>
<div class="First">"Those situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the higherplanets, those in the mode of passion live on the earthly planets, and those inthe mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds." (Bg. 14.18)The three general divisions of material life are called deva, tiryak andnara—that is, demigods subhuman creatures and human beings. In the variousspecies of life there are various facilities for material sense gratification.Different species are distinguished by differently formed senses, such as thegenitals, nostrils, tongue, ears and eyes. Pigeons, for example, are given thefacility for almost unlimited sex. Bears have an ample opportunity for sleeping.Tigers and lions exhibit the propensities for fighting and meat-eating, horsesare distinguished by their legs for swift running, vultures and eagles have keeneyesight, and so on. The human being is distinguished by his large brain, which is meant for understanding God.</div>
<div class="First">The phrase sva-mäträtma-prasiddhaye is very significant in this verse. Theword sva indicates possession. All living beings belong to the Supreme Lord(mamaiväàço jéva-loke jéva-bhütaù sanätanaù [Bg. 15.7]). Therefore accordingto this verse they have two options-mäträ-prasiddhaye and ätma-prasiddhaye.Mäträ refers to the material senses, and prasiddhaye refers to effectiveaccomplishment. Therefore mäträ-prasiddhaye means "efficiently engaging in sense gratification."</div>
<div class="First">On the other hand, ätma-prasiddhaye refers to Kåñëa consciousness. Thereare two categories of ätmä—the jévätmä, or ordinary living entity, who isdependent, and the Paramätmä, the supreme living entity, who isindependent. Some living entities desire to understand both categories ofätma, and in this verse the word ätma-prasiddhaye indicates that the materialworld is created to give those living entities the opportunity to achieve such anunderstanding and thus return to the kingdom of God, where life is eternal and full of bliss and knowledge.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Çrédhara Svämé confirms this by quoting a verse from the veda-stuti of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (10.87.2):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">buddhéndriya-manaù-präëän</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">janänäm asåjat prabhuù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mäträrthaà ca bhavärthaà ca</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ätmane 'kalpanäya ca</div>
<div class="First">"The Lord created the intelligence, senses, mind and vital air of the livingbeings for sense gratification, for performing sacrifices to attain higher births,and ultimately for offering sacrifices to the Supreme Soul."According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the actual purpose of the Lord's creation isonly one: to facilitate the advancement of devotional service to the LordHimself. Although it is stated that the Lord facilitates sense gratification, itshould be understood that the Supreme Personality of Godhead does notultimately condone the foolishness of the conditioned souls. The Lordfacilitates sense gratification (mäträ-prasiddhaye) so that the living entitieswill gradually understand the futility of trying to enjoy without Him. Everyliving entity is part and parcel of Kåñëa. In the Vedic literature the Lord givesa regulative program so that the living beings can gradually exhaust theirtendencies to be foolish and learn the value of surrender unto Him. The Lordis undoubtedly the reservoir of all beauty, bliss and satisfaction, and it is theduty of every living entity to engage in the loving service of the Lord.Although there are apparently two purposes for creation, it should beunderstood that ultimately the purpose is one. The arrangement for sensegratification is ultimately meant to bring the living entities to the single purpose of going back home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The Supersoul enters the material bodies of the created beings, activates the mind and senses, and thus causes the conditioned souls to approach the three modes of material nature for sense gratification.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The following is a summary of Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura's commentary on this verse.</div>
<div class="First">The one Supersoul enters the gross material elements (earth, water, fire, airand ether) and uses the activated material mind to subtly divide the sensoryactivities of the conditioned souls among the five knowledge-acquiring senses(the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin) and, by a further gross division, the fiveworking senses (the hands, legs, speech, genitals and anus). Because liberatedsouls have a strong tendency to serve the Lord, they are not attracted by thedualities of material good and evil. They derive their pleasure throughdevotion and love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who eternallyenjoys His own transcendental pastimes beyond the material manifestation.When the conditioned souls forget their loving relationship with theSupreme Personality of Godhead, they develop illicit desires. Therefore,unable to serve the form, taste, fragrance and other aspects of Lord Viñëu,these souls become bound to the bitter fruits of fruitive activities. But if theirlove of Godhead is somehow or other awakened, the conditioned souls candovetail all their sensory activities in the service of the Lord's transcendental pastimes.</div>
<div class="First">Actually, all materialistic activities are most undesirable. But theconditioned soul, under the influence of illusion, sees apparent distinctionsbetween good and bad, pleasing and displeasing, and so on. The Lord, theSupersoul, having entered the collective and individual consciousness of theliving entities, knows the heart of everyone. Therefore when a sincere soulaspires for spiritual perfection, the Lord frees him from material bondage andarouses his propensity to serve the Lord of Vaikuëöha. Love of Godheadflourishes in the variegated flavors of transcendental enjoyment. In ignorance,however, the conditioned soul considers himself the proper object of serviceand thus misunderstands the entire existential situation.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> The individual living being, the master of the material body, uses his material senses, which have been activated by the Supersoul, to try to enjoy sense objects composed of the three modes of nature. Thus he misidentifies the created material body with the unborn eternal self and becomes entangled in the illusory energy of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In this verse the living entity is called prabhuù, or "master," because he is aminute part and parcel of the supreme master, Kåñëa. Similarly, inBhagavad-gétä (15.8) the Lord has described the living entity as éçvaraù, "the controller."</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">çaréraà yad aväpnoti</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yac cäpy utkrämatéçvaraù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">gåhétvaitäni saàyäti</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">väyur gandhän iväçayät</div>
<div class="First">"The living entity in the material world carries his various conceptions of lifefrom one body to another as the air carries aromas." Çréla Prabhupäda hascommented in his purport, "Here the living entity is described as éçvaraù, thecontroller of his own body. If he likes, he can change his body to a highergrade, and if he likes he can move to a lower class. Minute independence isthere. The change his body undergoes depends upon him." This statementconfirms the words sva-mäträ and ätma-prasiddhaye in text 3 of this chapter. Ifthe Supreme Lord were to interfere with the minute independence of theliving entity, there would be no question of the living entity's engaging in theloving service of the Lord, since love implies a spontaneous free choice by thelover. Here the word prabhuù indicates that just as a child, having received atoy car from his father, pedals on the sidewalk, imitating the father, who drivesan actual car, the living entity pedals around the material universe in theinnumerable material bodies selected for him by the Supreme Lord from anassortment of 8,400,000 species. Thus the living entity, infatuated with thefalse ego of the material body, creates a fearful situation in which he undergoesrepeated birth and death, as described in the statement bhayaà dvitéyäbhiniveçataù syät (SB 11.2.37).</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has given another explanation for this verse. If the wordprabhuù is taken to mean the Supreme Lord, the word guëaiù can beunderstood to mean "good qualities," since guëa can refer to the materialmodes of nature or to admirable qualities (as in the verse yasyästi bhaktirbhagavaty akiïcanä sarvair guëais tatra samäsate suräù [SB 5.18.12]). This versewould then mean that the Lord, by His transcendental qualities (guëaiù), suchas mercy, is able to relish the transcendental qualities (guëän) of His puredevotees. Ätma-pratyoditaiù would then indicate that by surrendering unto theLord, who is the reservoir of all good qualities, the pure devotees becomesimilarly endowed with godly qualities. The words manyamäna idaà såñöamätmänam would indicate that the Lord accepts the body of His pure devotee tobe on the same spiritual level as He Himself, as indicated in the verse äcäryaàmäà vijänéyän nävamanyeta karhicit [SB 11.17.27]. The Lord is attracted by theloving devotional service of His pure devotees and thus becomes entangled inthe network of their loving relationship with Him. For example, after theBattle of Kurukñetra, when Kåñëa was leaving for His own city, Dvärakä, theloving appeal of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira forced the Lord to remain for severalmore weeks in Hastinäpura. Similarly, when the elderly gopés of Våndävanaclapped their hands, Kåñëa would dance like a puppet, keeping time to theirrhythm. In relation to this subject matter, Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has quoted a verse from Çrémad-Bhägavatam (9.4.68):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sädhavo hådayaà mahyaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sädhünäà hådayaà tv aham</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mad-anyat te na jänanti</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nähaà tebhyo manäg api</div>
<div class="First">"The pure devotee is always within the core of My heart, and I am always inthe heart of the pure devotee. My devotees do not know anything but Me, and I do not know anyone but them."</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura the word prabhuù mayalso be understood as follows. The word pra indicates prakarñeëa, or"excessively," and bhü indicates bhavati, or "taking birth." Thus prabhuùindicates prakarñeëa deva-tiryag-ädiñu bhavatéti saù, or repeatedly taking birthamong the demigods, animals, human beings and other forms of life.Confirming the statement by Çréla Jéva Gosvämé concerning the Lord'sattachment to the spiritualized body of a pure devotee, Çréla BhaktisiddhäntaSarasvaté Öhäkura has quoted the following verses from Caitanya-caritämåta (Antya 4.192-93):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">dékñä-käle bhakta kare ätma-samarpaëa</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sei-käle kåñëa täre kare ätma-sama</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Impelled by deep-rooted material desires, the embodied living entity engages his active sense organs in fruitive activities. He then experiences the results of his material actions by wandering throughout this world in so-called happiness and distress.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The argument may be given that if a living entity were subject to the resultsof his previous activities there would be no scope for free will; once havingcommitted a sinful action, the living entity would be bound in an endlesschain of suffering, being perpetually subject to previous reactions. Accordingto this speculation there cannot be a just and omniscient God, since the livingentity is forced to commit sinful activities by the reactions of his previousactivities, which were reactions to still previous activities. Since even anordinary gentleman will not unfairly punish an innocent person, how couldthere be a God witnessing the helpless suffering of the conditioned souls within this world?</div>
<div class="First">This foolish argument can easily be refuted by a practical example. If Ipurchase a ticket for an airline flight, board the plane and commence theflight, once the plane has taken off my decision to board the plane forces me tocontinue flying until the plane lands. But although I am forced to accept thereaction of this decision, on board the plane I have many new decisions I canmake. I may accept the food and drink from the stewardesses or reject it, I mayread a magazine or newspaper, I may sleep, walk up and down the aisle,converse with other passengers and so on. In other words, although the generalcontext—flying to a particular city—is forcibly imposed upon me as a reactionto my previous decision to board the plane, even within that situation I amconstantly making new decisions and creating new reactions. For example, if Icause a disturbance on the airplane I may be arrested when the plane lands.On the other hand, if I make friends with a businessman sitting next to me onthe plane, such a contact may lead to a favorable business transaction in the future.</div>
<div class="First">Similarly, although the living entity is forced to accept a particular body bythe laws of karma, within the human form of life there is always scope for freewill and decision-making. Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godheadcannot be considered unjust for holding the living entity in human liferesponsible for his present activities despite the living entity's undergoing the reactions of his previous work.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura the influence of mäyä isso strong that even in a hellish condition the proud conditioned soul thinks that he is enjoying life.</div>

When Lord Viñëu casts His potent glance in the form of käla, ortime, material interactions take place, culminating in the variegated creationof the material cosmos. In this verse it is stated that at the end of universaltime the same käla that originally incited the female nature into manifestationagain withdraws the cosmos into its original state of inert nonmanifestation.According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, the time potency itself,käla, is then withdrawn, and it merges into the Supreme Soul, who manifestsHimself as the original cause of material nature (anädir ädir govindaù sarva-käraëa-käraëam [Bs. 5.1]).</div>
<div class="First">Such technical arrangements for creation and annihilation, birth anddeath, do not exist in the eternal spiritual kingdom of God.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura the word vairäjaù inthis verse indicates the totality of the individual conditioned souls whooriginally take birth from Brahmä and are amalgamated back into him at thetime of annihilation. By the manifestation of the viräö-puruña, the universalform of the Lord, there is a temporary display of forms, qualities and activitieswithin the material creation. But the entire cosmic scene reverts to inertformlessness when the creation is withdrawn by the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. Therefore the Lord's universal form cannot be accepted as aneternal form of the Lord. It is merely the temporary imaginary resemblance ofHis personal form within the kingdom of mäyä. In the First Canto of theÇrémad-Bhägavatam, as well as in the Second Canto, the universal form of theLord is clearly explained to be an imaginary form offered to the neophyte formeditation on God. Those who are excessively materialistic are totally unableto understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is actuallysac-cid-änanda-vigraha [Bs. 5.1], or the eternal form of bliss and knowledge,transcendental to the exhibition of material energy. Therefore to encouragesuch gross materialists to become faithful theists, the Vedic literature instructsthem to meditate upon the physical universe as the gigantic body of theSupreme Lord. This pantheistic conception does not reflect the ultimatereality of the Supreme Lord but is a technique to bring the mind gradually toward God.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has quoted the following verse as evidence that LordBrahmä is supposed to go back to Godhead at the time of annihilation:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">brahmaëä saha te sarve</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sampräpte pratisaïcare</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">parasyänte kåtätmänaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">praviçanti paraà padam</div>
<div class="First">"At the time of final annihilation all self-realized souls enter with Brahmä intothe supreme abode." Since Brahmä is sometimes considered the best devotee ofthe Supreme Lord, he surely should obtain liberation rather than merelyentering into the unmanifest state of material nature called avyakta. In thisconnection Çréla Çrédhara Svämé points out that there is a class of nondevoteeswho attain the planet of Brahmä by performing açvamedha-yajïas and othersacrifices, and in certain cases Brahmä himself may not be a devotee of theSupreme Personality of Godhead. So the words avyaktaà viçate sükñmam canbe understood to indicate that such a nondevotee Brahmä cannot enter thespiritual sky, despite having achieved the ultimate universal status of materialexpertise. But when Brahmä is a devotee of the Supreme Personality ofGodhead the word avyaktam can be taken to indicate the spiritual sky; sincethe spiritual sky is not manifest to the conditioned souls, it may also beconsidered avyakta. If even Lord Brahmä cannot enter the kingdom of Godwithout surrendering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then what tospeak of other so-called pious or expert nondevotees.In this regard Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has pointed out thatthere are three categories within the status of Brahmä, namely those of karmé,jïäné and devotee. A Brahmä who is the most exalted karmé of the universewill have to come back to the material world; a living entity who has achievedthe post of Brahmä by being the greatest speculative philosopher within theuniverse may attain impersonal liberation; and a living entity who has beenawarded the post of Brahma due to being a great devotee of the SupremePersonality of Godhead enters into the personal abode of the Lord. In theÇrémad-Bhägavatam (3.32.15) yet another case is described: a Brahmä who is adevotee of the Lord but who has the tendency to think himself independent ofor equal to the Lord may achieve Mahä-Viñëu's abode at the time ofannihilation, but when creation begins again he has to return and again takethe post of Brahma. The word used in this case is bheda-dåñöyä, which refers tothe tendency to think oneself independently powerful. The variousdestinations possible for such an exalted living entity as a Lord Brahmädefinitely prove that any material position is worthless for guaranteeing aneternal life of bliss and knowledge. In Bhagavad-gétä Lord Kåñëa promises thatif one gives up all other so-called obligations and surrenders to the devotionalservice of the Lord, the Lord will personally protect him and bring him back tothe supreme abode in the spiritual sky. It is futile and foolish to try to achieveperfection by one's own strenuous endeavor and not surrender to the lotus feetof Kåñëa. Such a blind attempt is described in the Eighteenth Chapter ofBhagavad-gétä as bahuläyäsam, indicating that it is work in the material modeof passion. Brahmä is the lord of passion, and his creation and management ofthe entire universe are certainly bahuläyäsam, or strenuous endeavor, in themost exalted sense. But all such passionate work, even that of Lord Brahmä, isultimately useless without surrender to the lotus feet of Kåñëa.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">King Nimi had expressed to the nava-yogendras his fear of the illusorypotency of the Lord and had requested a detailed explanation of mäyä so thathe could avoid becoming a victim at her hands. Now, Çré Antarékña, havingdescribed the illusory potency, is suggesting that the King inquire about themeans to become totally free of mäyä's influence. Not waiting for the King toask such a question, Çré Antarékña himself is suggesting, "Now that you haveheard about mäyä's influence, you should inquire about the process ofbecoming free of such influence." According to Çrédhara Svämé, that is thesignificance of Çré Antarékña's question kià bhüyaù çrotum icchasi, "What more do you wish to hear?"</div>
<div class="First">The following is a summary of Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura'sexplanation of the process of annihilation described in the previous verses.Väsudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the presiding Deity ofconsciousness, which becomes manifest within the mahat-tattva. By furthertransformations of the mahat-tattva the threefold false ego appears as follows.(1) From vaikärika, false ego in the mode of goodness, appears the eleventhsense, the mind, whose presiding Deity is Aniruddha. (2) From taijasa, falseego in the mode of passion, comes intelligence, whose presiding Deity isPradyumna, and the five working senses and five knowledge-acquiring senseswith their various presiding deities. (3) From false ego in the mode ofignorance arises the subtle form of sound, and from that sound, or çabda, allthe material elements gradually become manifest, beginning with ether andthe sense of hearing. The presiding Deity of these three divisions of false ego isSaìkarñaëa. This description is taken from Chapter 26 of the Third Canto ofÇrémad-Bhägavatam, verses 21, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32 and 35.The Supreme Personality of Godhead's external potency, mäyä, causes thebirth, maintenance and destruction of the material world. She is tricoloredred, white and black. In her red feature the material nature is created, in whiteit endures, and in black it is annihilated. The mahat-tattva arises from thismäyä, and from the mahat-tattva come the three varieties of false egomentioned above. At the time of annihilation the five great elements, namelyearth, water, fire, air and ether, merge into false ego in the mode of ignorance,from which they were originally generated; the ten senses and intelligencemerge into false ego in passion; and the mind, along with the demigods, mergesinto false ego in the mode of goodness, which then merges into mahat-tattva,which further takes shelter of the prakåti or unmanifest pradhäna.As described above, each of the gross elements is wound up when itsdistinguishing quality is removed; the element then merges into the previouselement. This can be understood as follows. In space or ether there is thequality of sound. In air there are the qualities of sound and touch. In fire thereare sound, touch and form. In water there are sound, touch, form and taste.And in earth there are sound, touch, form, taste and aroma. Therefore fromether down to earth each element is distinguished by the addition of its ownunique quality, called guëa-viçeñam. When that quality is removed, an elementbecomes nondifferent from its previous element and thus merges into it. Forexample, when great winds take aroma away from earth, earth contains onlysound, touch, form and taste and thus becomes nondifferent from water, intowhich it merges. Similarly when water loses its rasa, or taste, it contains onlysound, touch and form, thus becoming nondifferent from fire, which alsocontains those three qualities. So the wind takes away aroma to merge earthinto water and takes away taste to merge water into fire. Then when theuniversal darkness removes form from fire, fire merges into air. Space thenremoves the sense of touch from air, and air merges into space. The SupremePersonality of Godhead as the time element removes sound from space, andspace then merges into the false ego in the mode of ignorance, from which itarose. Finally, false ego is merged into the mahat-tattva, which is merged intothe unmanifest pradhäna, and thus the universe is annihilated.</div>

<div class="First">According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, sthüla-dhiyaù indicates those whoignorantly identify themselves with the gross material body and who aretherefore unable to analyze the subtle laws of nature by which the soultransmigrates in illusion. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé comments that sthüla-dhiyaù alsoindicates so-called pious persons who execute pompous religious ceremoniesfor material sense gratification rather than trying to prepare themselves to goback home, back to Godhead, by engaging in the loving devotional service of the Lord.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, King Nimi was alreadyan advanced devotee of the Lord and therefore knew that one can cross overthe illusory energy, mäyä, by surrendering to the lotus feet of the Lord andpleasing Him by pure devotional service. Therefore the King was asking thequestion for the benefit of those who falsely consider themselves very muchlearned but in fact are addicted to materialistic fruitive activities, whichincreasingly entangle them in illusion. In this regard Çréla ViçvanäthaCakravarté Öhäkura has quoted from the Amara-koça dictionary to show thatakåtätmabhiù indicates apürëatvam, or one whose life is empty.Every living being has an eternal relationship with the supreme livingbeing, Kåñëa. One may love Kåñëa by thinking of Him as one's eternal master,one's most intimate friend, one's beloved child or the object of one's conjugalattraction. Of course, such ecstasies should never be confused with ordinary,material emotions, which are perverted reflections of spiritual rasas, orrelationships. In the material world we try to relish these same relationships ofservitude, friendship, parental love and conjugal love, but the object of suchfeelings is a temporary material body, which is quickly devastated by the lawsof nature. These loving feelings should be directed toward the spiritual body ofthe Supreme Personality, Kåñëa, who is the reservoir of all beauty andtranscendental bliss. One who has not learned the art of directing his love toKåñëa is apürëa, or one whose life is ultimately empty.According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, one whose life is emptycan also be called manda-dhéù, or one whose intelligence is crippled by a lack ofbroad experience. King Nimi, a pure Vaiñëava, was so kind that he asked,"How can such cripple-minded people cross over mäyä in the easiest waypossible, since by nature they are very lazy in spiritual matters?"</div>

Even in material heaven the living entity is disturbed by rivalry with his equals and envy of those superior to him. And since one's residence in heaven is finished with the exhaustion of pious fruitive activities, the denizens of heaven are afflicted by fear, anticipating the destruction of their heavenly life. Thus they resemble kings who, though enviously admired by ordinary citizens, are constantly harassed by enemy kings and who therefore never attain actual happiness.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has quoted the following text from the ChändogyaUpaniñad (8.1.6): tad yatheha karma-cito lokaù kñéyate, evam evämutrapuëya-cito lokaù kñéyate. "One's present status of material pleasure, the result ofone's previous work, will eventually be vanquished by time. Similarly, althoughby executing pious activities one will be elevated to a higher status in the nextlife, that future situation will also be vanquished." The basis of materialenjoyment is the particular body one has acquired. The material body iskarma-citaù, the accumulated result of one's previous material activities. If oneis awarded a body decorated with beauty, education, popularity, strength andso on, his standard of material enjoyment is certainly high class. On the otherhand, if one is ugly, mentally retarded, crippled or repulsive to others, there isvery little hope for his material happiness. In both cases, however, thesituation is flickering and temporary. One who has acquired an attractive bodyshould not rejoice, since death will quickly bring an end to such anintoxicating situation. Similarly, one who has taken birth in an obnoxioussituation should not lament, since his suffering is also temporary. The beautifulman and the ugly man, the rich and the poor, the educated and the foolishshould all endeavor to become Kåñëa conscious so that they can be elevated totheir eternal constitutional situation, which is to reside in the planets beyondthis material universe. Originally every living entity is unimaginably beautiful,intelligent, wealthy, and so strong that his spiritual body lives forever. But wefoolishly give up this eternal, blissful situation because we are unwilling tomeet the condition for eternal life. The condition is that one should be a loverof the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Although love of Kåñëa is themost exquisite ecstasy, surpassing by millions of times the most intensepleasure of the material universe, we foolishly break off our loving affair withthe Supreme Lord and artificially try to become independent enjoyers in thematerial atmosphere of self-delusion and false pride.Even if one reaches the exalted heavenly planets of this universe he will beafflicted by various types of suffering. Every conditioned soul in the materialworld wants to become the greatest person. Therefore one is constantlyharassed by his equals who have a similar desire. This situation is commonlytermed the "rat race" of material existence. Even on the heavenly planets thereis a similar rat race for heavenly distinction. Since some persons inevitablyexcel our own achievements, our hearts burn with envy upon seeing othersenjoying the very rewards we have strived for. And because our wholesituation is temporary, we must undergo fear, anxiety and death even on theheavenly planets. The example given here is very nice. Minor kings may beenviously admired by ordinary citizens for their wealth, power and fame, butsuch kings themselves constantly burn with jealousy, resentment and fear dueto rivalry and threats from other kings. Similarly, modern politicians are constantly harassed by envy and fear.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has pointed out that theconditioned souls, being eager to acquire material happiness and avoid distress,take shelter of sexual relationships and thus surrender to the hard labor offruitive activities. Those who are enlightened, however, can perceive theultimate futility of such gross materialistic endeavors. One's so-called wife,home, children, relatives, bank account and so on are all temporaryphantasmagoria, and even while manifest they can never give real satisfactionto one's senses. To acquire wealth in this world one is practically forced tobecome the killer of his own soul. There is no possibility of acquiring pleasurefrom materialistic activities, since they are performed with temporary senses inthe hot pursuit of temporary sense objects. When the conditioned soulachieves his goal he becomes proud and brags to others as if his achievementswere permanent. And when defeated he is submerged in lamentation. Such atendency to consider oneself the doer is a sign of weak intelligence, since infact the living entity is merely desiring within the material body. The bodyitself is moved by the forces of material nature, under the control of God. Therelationships of master and servant, father and son, husband and wife entailexchanges of well-wishing and service that give a sense of materialgratification, but such ephemeral devotion can never bring about the eternalabsolute benefit of the soul. By such temporary gratification, mäyä induces theconditioned soul to wander throughout the material world, pursuing therelative rewards of material nature. According to the subtle laws of karma, theliving entity achieves happiness and distress. One cannot obtain happiness byforce, no matter how strenuously or how long one tries. Therefore those whoseintelligence is uncontaminated should surrender at the lotus feet of Kåñëa andgive up the ludicrous pursuit of permanent material happiness, a pursuit which can be compared to a dog's chasing its tail.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Therefore any person who seriously desires real happiness must seek a bona fide spiritual master and take shelter of him by initiation. The qualification of the bona fide guru is that he has realized the conclusions of the scriptures by deliberation and is able to convince others of these conclusions. Such great personalities, who have taken shelter of the Supreme Godhead, leaving aside all material considerations, should be understood to be bona fide spiritual masters.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, the word çäbde refers to the Vedicliterature, and pare refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The bonafide spiritual master must be niñëätam, deeply experienced in authorized Vedicliteratures and in practical understanding of the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. Without scriptural knowledge and practical realization of thePersonality of Godhead, a so-called guru will be unable to dissipate the doubtsof his disciples and therefore unable to execute the function of bringing thesincere student back home, back to Godhead. The symptom of realizedunderstanding of the Vedas and Kåñëa is upaçamäçrayam. In other words, thebona fide spiritual master is one who has retired from the glittering illusions of materialistic society, friendship and love.</div>
<div class="First">Within the material world one is certainly attracted to becoming a greatintellectual, a powerful politician, the loving father of many beautiful andaffectionate little children, a most honored welfare worker or a highly admiredand successful businessman. But none of these material positions have apermanent basis, nor do they afford permanent happiness, because they are allbased on the primary misunderstanding by which one identifies himself with the material body.</div>
<div class="First">Anyone can readily experience that he is not the body but consciousness.Even if one loses a limb of his body, he does not cease to exist as a consciousentity. Ultimately, the entire body is lost at the time of death, and the livingentity acquires a new body. The preliminary understanding of one's identity asconsciousness is called self-realization. But beyond this elementary knowledgeis the elaborate subject matter of how the soul came to exist within the cycle of8,400,000 material species of life. And if the living entity is not the materialbody but consciousness, he must ultimately have an original status on a higher platform.</div>
<div class="First">Punishment implies reward also; a powerful man who can punish is also ableto reward. Therefore, the existence of punishment for the living being, who isforced to take a miserable material body subject to birth, old age, disease anddeath, also logically implies the existence of a reward for him. Although wemistakenly consider material sense gratification the ultimate reward of life,material happiness is actually another type of punishment, since it entices oneto continue rotating in the cycle of birth and death. In the Western countriesviolent prisoners are placed in solitary confinement whereas well-behavedprisoners are sometimes allowed to work in the warden's garden or library as areward. But any position in prison is ultimately a punishment. Similarly, theexistence of higher and lower categories of material sense gratification doesnot explain the living entity's ultimate reward, which must constitute thenatural antithesis of the punishment of material existence. That actual rewardis an eternal life of bliss and knowledge in the kingdom of God, where there isno punishment. The kingdom of God is Vaikuëöha, or unconditional pleasure.There is no punishment in the spiritual world; it is a place of ever-increasing pleasure.</div>
<div class="First">A bona fide spiritual master is one who is expert in all of these subjectmatters, not by his personal imagination or speculation but by matureunderstanding of the authorized Vedic literatures, which are the literarymanifestation of the causeless mercy of God. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä (9.3).</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">måtyu-saàsära-vartmani</div>
<div class="First">"Those who are not faithful on the path of devotional service cannot attainMe, O conqueror of foes, but return to birth and death in this material world."Therefore the spiritual master must awaken the disciple to the eternalexistence of devotional service. The example may be given that in the earlymorning a mother may enter her child's room to wake him up so that he canattend school. The child does not want to get up, but the loving mother forceshim to get up and sends him off to school to be educated. Similarly, the bonafide spiritual master awakens the sleeping soul and sends him to the gurukula,or the äçrama of the spiritual master, where he can be trained in perfect knowledge.</div>
<div class="First">If the disciple has doubts about the value of Kåñëa consciousness, the bonafide spiritual master must dissipate those doubts by superior knowledge. Onewho himself doubts the authority of Kåñëa or Vedic knowledge cannot becomea bona fide spiritual master. On the other hand, kibä vipra, kibä nyäsé, çüdrakena naya/ yei kåñëa-tattva-vettä, sei 'guru' haya: [Cc. Madhya 8.128] any humanbeing from any social or economic status can become a bona fide spiritualmaster if he knows the science of Kåñëa. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu said,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yäre dekha, täre kaha 'kåñëa'-upadeça</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ämära äjïäya guru haïä tära ei deça</div>
<div class="First">"Instruct everyone to follow the orders of Lord Çré Kåñëa as they are given inBhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam. In this way become a spiritual masterand try to liberate everyone in this land." (Cc. Madhya 7.128) Only by theorder and authority of the Supreme Lord one can become a spiritual master, not by one's own so-called erudition.</div>
<div class="First">The duty of the bona fide guru is to connect the disciple to Kåñëa. Ascholar or meditator has no potency to connect another living being withKåñëa if that scholar or meditator himself is not connected with Kåñëa.Although many sports fans attend gymnastic competitions and applaud at theexhibition of difficult calisthenic feats, the Supreme Personality of Godhead isnot such a gymnastic spectator, and He does not applaud the calisthenicsexhibited by foolish persons in the name of yoga. Nor is the SupremePersonality of Godhead impressed by mediocre attempts at philosophicalspeculation, since the Lord has already given His own opinion inBhagavad-gétä (çåëu me paramaà vacaù). The word of Kåñëa is paramaà vacaù,the last word in knowledge. And Kåñëa says, yaj jïätvä neha bhüyo 'nyajjïätavyam avaçiñyate: "When you know this knowledge there shall remainnothing further to be known." Kåñëa has also referred to His knowledge as räja-vidyä, the king of all knowledge.</div>
<div class="First">If one does not become a lover of Kåñëa, his connection with Kåñëa takesplace indirectly, through the illusory potency of the Lord. The idea that onecan attract the Supreme Lord through mere gymnastics or foolish speculationon the Absolute Truth is certainly a product of mäyä. One who is connected toKåñëa through His external, illusory potency can serve only as a materialmaster to connect his so-called disciples to the same illusory energy. On the</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">other hand, in Bhagavad-gétä (9.13) it is said,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mahätmänas tu mäà pärtha</div>

<div class="First">Those who are actually great souls have surrendered to the internal potency ofthe Lord and can similarly connect others to the internal pleasure-givingpotency. A mahätmä is described in Bhagavad-gétä as follows: väsudevaù sarvamiti sa mahätmä sudurlabhaù [Bg. 7.19]. "He knows Me to be the cause of allcauses and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare." It is to such a spiritualmaster, who has reached the mature understanding that Väsudeva iseverything, that one must surrender. According to Çré Närada Muni, yo vidvänsa gurur hariù: such a great soul is to be considered the external manifestation of Kåñëa Himself. Kåñëa states this also:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">äcäryaà mäà vijänéyän</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nävamanyeta karhicit</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na martya-buddhyäsüyeta</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sarva-devamayo guruù</div>
<div class="First">"One should know the äcärya to be My self and never disrespect him in anyway. One should not envy him, thinking him an ordinary man, for he is the representative of all the demigods." (SB 11.17.27)</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, if a spiritual mastercannot destroy his disciple's doubts by superior knowledge, the disciple willgradually become despondent in spiritual life. Because a bogus guru cannotactually give Kåñëa to the disciple according to the principle of rasa-varjaàraso 'py asya, the disciple will again become attracted to material happiness,not having achieved the bliss of Kåñëa's association. Such a weak disciple of aweak spiritual master will gradually become hopeless and discouraged in hisattempt at self-realization and will again become fascinated by the temptationsof illusion, such as women, money and so-called intellectuality based on speculation and imagination.</div>
<div class="First">Further symptoms of the bona fide spiritual master are given in the Upadeçämåta (1) as follows:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">väco vegaà manasaù krodha-vegaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">jihvä-vegam udaropastha-vegam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">etän vegän yo viñaheta dhéraù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sarväm apémäà påthivéà sa çiñyät</div>
<div class="First">"A sober person who can tolerate the urge to speak, the mind's demands, theactions of anger and the urges of the tongue, belly and genitals is qualified tomake disciples all over the world." Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura hasstated, upaçamäçrayaà krodha-lobhädy-avaçé-bhütam: a bona fide spiritualmaster cannot be under the control of ordinary anger, greed and lust.According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, one who hasunderstood the futility of material existence can approach a bona fide spiritualmaster. In the two previous verses the futility of earthly and heavenly sensegratification has been described. Now, the natural conclusion is that one whohas understood this should approach a bona fide spiritual master. The bonafide spiritual master broadcasts the sound vibration from the spiritual planetscalled Vaikuëöha. The inhabitants of the spiritual planets, headed by theSupreme Personality of Godhead Himself, are certainly not deaf and dumb;they are in constant communication through unlimited transcendental blissand knowledge. And the bona fide spiritual master can transmit this soundvibration of bliss and knowledge to his disciple. Just as a radio broadcastsmundane news, the bona fide guru broadcasts the news from Vaikuëöha. Thisis confirmed by Narottama däsa Öhäkura: golokera prema-dhana,hari-näma-saìkértana. The spiritual master also transmits to the disciple theholy name of Kåñëa, which is nondifferent from Kåñëa Himself. The bona fideguru informs his disciple that every living entity is qualitatively one with theSupreme Lord but quantitatively different and thus engages the disciple in theloving service of the Lord. Because the living entity is qualitatively one withthe Lord and is part of Him, there is an eternal loving relationship betweenthem. And because the living entity is quantitatively different, thatrelationship is eternally one of service. According to Çréla BhaktisiddhäntaSarasvaté Öhäkura, even though one may have the good fortune to accept abona fide, highly qualified guru, if one maintains a taste for fruitive activitiesor mental speculation one's advancement will be checked. But if a seriousstudent surrenders to a bona fide spiritual master there is absolutely noimpediment to the transmission of perfect knowledge and bliss in the devotional service of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Accepting the bona fide spiritual master as one's life and soul and worshipable deity, the disciple should learn from him the process of pure devotional service. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, the soul of all souls, is inclined to give Himself to His pure devotees. Therefore, the disciple should learn from the spiritual master to serve the Lord without duplicity and in such a faithful and favorable way that the Supreme Lord, being satisfied, will offer Himself to the faithful disciple.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé the Lord's tendency to give Himself toHis pure devotee is demonstrated in the case of Bali Mahäräja, who sacrificedhis universal kingdom for the pleasure of Lord Vämanadeva. Lord Vämana wasso pleased by the selfless surrender of Bali Mahäräja that the Lord became thedoorman in the palace of Bali who was reinstalled as a great leader in the universe.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Jéva Gosvämé comments that the spiritual master is to be consideredthe ätmä, or the very life, of the disciple, since real life begins when one isinitiated by a bona fide spiritual master. Although one may experience manyseemingly wonderful or important events in a dream, one's real life beginswhen he wakes up. Similarly, since the spiritual master gives birth to thedisciple by awakening him to spiritual life, a bona fide disciple understandsthat his spiritual master is the very basis of his life.According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the Supreme Personality of Godhead isthe reservoir of all pleasure, and thus the Lord's giving Himself to a puredevotee indicates that such a devotee becomes immersed in the highestpossible ecstasy. In this connection there is the following çruti-mantra:änandäd dhémäni bhütäni jäyante. "Indeed, it is from the all-blissful Supremethat all these creatures have come into being." Çréla Viçvanätha CakravartéÖhäkura has further pointed out that when the Lord bestows His own selfupon a pure devotee such a fortunate devotee can actually see the Lord, touch Him and directly engage in His service.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, one should neverconsider one's spiritual master to be mundane or on an equal level with one'sself. One should see the spiritual master as being always under the shelter ofthe lotus feet of the Supreme Lord. One should never try to engage thespiritual master in one's personal service with the mentality of lording it overthe spiritual master and attaining through him some material gain. One who isactually advancing will become more and more eager to serve the spiritualmaster, and thus such a disciple experiences the pleasure of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé has delineated four preliminary requisites for advancement for the sincere disciple:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">guru-pädäçrayas tasmät</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kåñëa-dékñädi-çikñaëam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">viçrambheëa guroù sevä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sädhu-vartmänuvartanam</div>
<div class="First">"[1] Accepting the shelter of the lotus feet of a bona fide spiritual master, [2]becoming initiated by the spiritual master and learning how to dischargedevotional service from him, [3] obeying the orders of the spiritual master withfaith and devotion, and [4] following in the footsteps of great äcäryas [teachers]under the direction of the spiritual master." (Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 1.2.74)One who has executed these preliminary duties is qualified to relish Çrémad-Bhägavatam.</div>
<div class="First">When one actually hears the sound vibration of Çrémad-Bhägavatam as it is,he becomes free from the desire for sense gratification and mental speculationand is happy and satisfied in the service of Lord Kåñëa.</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yasyäà vai çrüyamäëäyäà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kåñëe parama-püruñe</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhaktir utpadyate puàsaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">çoka-moha-bhayäpahä</div>
<div class="First">"Simply by giving aural reception to Çrémad-Bhägavatam, the feeling for lovingdevotional service to Lord Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, sproutsup at once to extinguish the fire of lamentation, illusion and fearfulness." (SB1.7.7) One should hear Çrémad-Bhägavatam from a bona fide spiritual masterwho can expertly engage the propensity for loving Kåñëa that arises fromhearing the transcendental sound of the Bhägavatam. Such a transcendental,authorized engagement is called bhägavata-dharma. Within the InternationalSociety for Krishna Consciousness there are many thousands of authorizedengagements pertaining to the Society's missionary activities. And by hearingthe Çrémad-Bhägavatam and performing such engagements the Society'smembers feel relief from çoka (lamentation), moha (illusion) and bhaya (fear).According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, those who haveachieved a mature understanding of the transcendental sound vibration ofÇrémad-Bhägavatam may adopt the order of tridaëòi-sannyäsa, as described inthe Haàsa-gétä, the Thirteenth Chapter of this canto. A so-called Vaiñëavawho whimsically neglects the strict control of the body, mind and speechcannot actually achieve shelter at the lotus feet of a bona fide spiritual master.Even if such a whimsical sense enjoyer makes a show of assuming the dress anddaëòa of Vaiñëava sannyäsa, he will not attain the desired result, love ofKåñëa. A bona fide Vaiñëava should work earnestly to free himself from anytinge of sense gratification and mental speculation, and with a loving heart heshould carry out the orders of his bona fide spiritual master. By alwaysremembering the exalted position of the bona fide spiritual master, the disciple will achieve shelter at the lotus feet of Kåñëa.</div>

<div class="Translation"> A sincere disciple should learn to dissociate the mind from everything material and positively cultivate association with his spiritual master and other saintly devotees.

Thus he should learn to deal properly with all living beings.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted from the Garuòa Puräëa to demonstrate thatwithin this universe those who take birth as demigods, great åñis or pioushuman beings are all considered santaù, or saintly persons. According toBhagavad-gétä, traiguëya-viñayä vedäù: the varëäçrama culture described inVedic literature deals mostly with the living entities who are struggling withinthe three modes of nature. The Vedic literatures teach such conditioned soulsthat material happiness can be achieved only through pious works. In thissense, the demigods are to be considered the most pious living entities withinthe three modes of material nature. The åñis, or the great saintly mystics of theuniverse, who are able to travel at will to various planets and who cultivatemystic powers, are to be considered somewhat below the demigods. And thosehuman beings on earth who perfectly execute the Vedic rituals are to beconsidered in the third or lowest category of santaù, or saintly persons. But adevotee of the Lord is beyond the three modes of material nature. Lord Kåñëa</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">says in Bhagavad-gétä (14.26),</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mäà ca yo 'vyabhicäreëa</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhakti-yogena sevate</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sa guëän samatétyaitän</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">brahma-bhüyäya kalpate</div>
<div class="First">"One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in anycircumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comesto the level of Brahman." Thus Lord Kåñëa clearly says that a Vaiñëava whodoes not fall down from the regulations of bhakti-yoga is beyond the threemodes of nature. And Lord Kåñëa advised Arjuna, a kåñëa-bhakta, to transcendthe three material qualities of the illusory creation of mäyä (nistraiguëyobhavärjuna). But in the Eighteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä (18.40) the Lord</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">says,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na tad asti påthivyäà vä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">divi deveñu vä punaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sattvaà prakåti-jair muktaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yad ebhiù syät tribhir guëaiù</div>
<div class="First">"There is no being existing, either here or among the demigods in the higherplanetary systems, who is free from the three modes of material nature." Thusthe demigods are not exempt from the pollution of the three modes of materialnature, whereas a pure devotee actually becomes guëätéta, or transcendental to the influence of mäyä.</div>
<div class="First">Therefore, one should cultivate the association of the uttama-adhikäré, orpure devotee of the Lord, as stated previously (SB 11.3.21):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tasmäd guruà prapadyeta</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">jijïäsuù çreya uttamam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">çäbde pare ca niñëätaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">brahmaëy upaçamäçrayam</div>
<div class="First">"Therefore any person who seriously desires real happiness must seek a bonafide spiritual master and take shelter of him by initiation. The qualification ofthe bona fide guru is that he has realized the conclusions of the scriptures bydeliberation and is able to convince others of these conclusions. Such greatpersonalities, who have taken shelter of the Supreme Godhead, leaving asideall material considerations, should be understood to be bona fide spiritual masters."</div>
<div class="First">On the other hand, one should avoid the association of a materialisticperson even if such a person is outwardly chanting the holy names of Kåñëa.</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé has advised in this respect,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kåñëeti yasya giri taà manasädriyeta</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">dékñästi cet praëatibhiç ca bhajantam éçam</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">çünya-hådam épsita-saìga-labdhyä</div>
<div class="First">One may mentally offer respect to any living entity who is chanting the holyname of Kåñëa, but one should avoid intimate association with materialisticpersons, especially those attached to sex enjoyment. Tamo-dväraà yoñitäàsaìgi-saìgam. If one associates with a sensuous person who is attached to thecompany of women, by such association one will surely go to hell.But if a materialistic person approaches a pure devotee with a sincere desireto hear from him about spiritual improvement, that first-class devotee maymercifully give his association, provided the purpose of such a meeting isadvancement in the devotional service of Kåñëa. By such association even amaterialistic person can gradually become a pure devotee of Kåñëa. If anadvanced devotee is not able to engage a materialistic person in the devotionalservice of Kåñëa, such association is strictly forbidden.</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">In the Garuòa Puräëa it is stated,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">viçeñataù svottameñu</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">vinä saìgaà na mucyate</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sva-néceñu tu deveñu</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">vinä saìgaà na püryate</div>
<div class="First">"One cannot be liberated without association with a pure devotee of the Lord.And unless one shows mercy to those in an inferior position, one's life will besuperficial." It is our practical experience in the Kåñëa consciousnessmovement that those who are expanding their mercy by preaching the messageof Kåñëa are making rapid spiritual progress, and their life is filled withtranscendental bliss. Those who neglect the quality of mercy, beinguninterested in the missionary activities of the Kåñëa consciousnessmovement, are not filled with transcendental pleasure as described here by theword püryate. Not being filled with spiritual pleasure, surely such personsattempt to fill their lives with material pleasure through sense gratificationand mental speculation, associating with women or reading innumerablemundane novels, newspapers, newsmagazines, and so on. According to ÇréCaitanya Mahäprabhu the preaching activities of the Kåñëa consciousnessmovement are änandämbudhi-vardhanam, the ever-increasing ocean of bliss.Missionary activities are based on the principle of dayäm, or mercy to thosewho are fallen. Those who are actually preaching become enlivened byassociating with other preachers. This principle is called maitrém, or friendshipamong equals. The power to carry out such preaching activities, as well as theproper guidance for distributing Kåñëa's message, comes through the principleof praçrayam, or humble service at the lotus feet of spiritual authorities such asthe spiritual master. If one preaches Kåñëa consciousness sincerely under theguidance of a bona fide spiritual master and in the company of fellowpreachers, one is perfectly fulfilling the statement of this verse ofÇrémad-Bhägavatam, and thus he will come to the point of sarvato manaso'saìgam, or complete detachment from the illusory energy of the Lord.Caitanya Mahäprabhu has stated, lava-mätra sädhu-saìge sarva-siddhi haya[Cc. Madhya 22.54]. By becoming attached to the devotees of the Lord, one willachieve all perfection in life, going back home, back to Godhead.If one neglects the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead byengaging in sinful life, he is certainly not merciful. One who ignores hiseternal status as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and who instead covershimself more and more with material illusions in the form of temporarydesignations—"I am American," "I am Russian," "I am Indian," "I am black," "Iam white" and so on—is certainly a killer of his own soul and cannot beconsidered merciful. Similarly, those who support animal slaughter by eatingmeat, fish and eggs cannot be considered merciful. Sometimes the argument isgiven that if one does not harm others he is perfectly religious. But because weare now in a state of ignorance, we have no idea whatsoever of the futurereactions to our present activities. Ignorantly boasting that one is not harmingothers, without an awareness of the subtle laws of nature, does not make one areligious person. One becomes religious by surrendering to the laws of God asthey are stated by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gétä. As long as a living entityis infatuated with his own mental speculations, which carry him away like thewaves of the ocean, he cannot understand the process of devotional service tothe Supreme Personality of Godhead. Mental speculations based on ourexperience of the variegated creations of the Lord's illusory energy areincapable of bringing us to perfect knowledge. One must give up materialisticassociation and make company with pure devotees of the Lord, those who areengaged twenty-four hours a day in perfectly pleasing the Supreme Lord.One should cultivate association with those who are more advanced thanoneself in devotional service. One's advancement can be measured by one'sdetachment from sense gratification and his ability to distribute Kåñëaconsciousness to others. In this connection Çréla Narottama däsa Öhäkura hassaid, chäòiyä vaiñëava-sevä, nistära päyeche kebä: "Who can attain salvation ifhe gives up the service of the Vaiñëavas?" By serving the lotus feet of puredevotees, one is immediately enlightened with spiritual knowledge. All of theso-called pleasures of the material world, culminating in many varieties ofsexual fantasy and impersonal visions of oneself as God, become useless to onewho has achieved the mercy of the lotus feet of a pure devotee of Kåñëa. Theentire material creation is compared to an insignificant bubble in the ocean.The material universe rests on the spiritual potency of the Lord calledbrahmajyoti, just as an insignificant bubble rests on the potency of theunlimited ocean. By serving the lotus feet of a pure devotee one can enter theocean of eternal happiness and experience his constitutional position as aservant of Kåñëa. The mercy of the Vaiñëavas is unlimited, and one who hastasted that mercy becomes mad after the lotus feet of Kåñëa, not caring for thehallucinations of so-called material pleasure or mental speculation. The mercyof the Vaiñëavas is substantial and as powerful as Kåñëa Himself, whereasimpersonal speculations and hopeless dreams of society, friendship and lovemerely constitute various means by which mäyä cheats the conditioned souls and keeps them in perpetual frustration.</div>

<div class="Translation"> To serve the spiritual master the disciple should learn cleanliness, austerity, tolerance, silence, study of Vedic knowledge, simplicity, celibacy, nonviolence, and equanimity in the face of material dualities such as heat and cold, happiness and distress.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çaucam, or "cleanliness," refers to both internal and external purity. Oneshould remain externally clean by bathing with soap and water at least onceand, if possible, three times daily. One is considered internally pure when he isfree from the pollution of false pride and egotism. Tapaù, or "austerity," meansthat despite the irrational impulses of the mind one should remain fixed inexecuting his proper duty in life. Specifically, one must control burning angerand the urge for wanton sex life. If a human being does not control theimpulses of lust, anger and greed, he loses his power to understand his actualsituation. Human life is a golden opportunity to solve the overwhelmingproblems of birth, death, old age and disease. According to the Viñëu Puräëa</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">(3.8.9),</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">varëäçramäcära-vatä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">puruñeëa paraù pumän</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">viñëur ärädhyate panthä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nänyat tat-toña-käraëam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">[Cc. Madhya 8.58]</div>
<div class="First">Every human being can achieve spiritual perfection by dedicating the fruits ofhis prescribed work to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu. Similarly,in Bhagavad-gétä (18.45) Lord Kåñëa clearly states, sve sve karmaëy abhirataùsaàsiddhià labhate naraù. One does not have to adopt a monastic life or live inthe forest as a yogé; one can achieve perfection by dedicating his occupationalduties to the Supreme Lord. Similarly, Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura has said,nämäçraya kari' yatane tumi, thakaha äpana käje. If one sincerely takes shelterof the holy names of Kåñëa by chanting Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa,Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, he will achievespiritual perfection within the compass of his normal daily activities.Unfortunately, if a human being neglects the regulative principles of civilizedlife that prohibit illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling, he willsurely be overwhelmed by the waves of lust and anger, which completely coverone's consciousness of the reality of spiritual life and draw one to engage in thephantasmagoria of the temporary material body. As Lord Kåñëa has stated in</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">Bhagavad-gétä (3.39),</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ävåtaà jïänam etena</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">jïänino nitya-vairiëä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">käma-rüpeëa kaunteya</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">duñpüreëänalena ca</div>
<div class="First">"Thus a man's pure consciousness is covered by his eternal enemy in the formof lust, which is never satisfied and which burns like fire." Therefore, the wordtapaù, or "austerity," in this verse indicates that one must remain in hisprescribed duty and not become impatient or unregulated due to the waves of lust, anger and greed.</div>
<div class="First">The word titikñäm, or "tolerance," indicates that a transcendentalist must beforgiving. The material world is full of embarrassing and irritating situations,and unless one is inclined to be very much forgiving he will become infectedby a vindictive mentality, which spoils one's spiritual consciousness. Maunam,or "silence," means that one should not speak on worthless or frivolous topics,but should discuss the actual issues of human life such as going back home,back to Godhead. Remaining completely silent is a symptom of ignorance; astone is silent due to a lack of consciousness. Since every material thing has itsspiritual counterpart, the Vedic çästras contain negative and positiveinjunctions. Corresponding to the negative injunction against speech is thepositive injunction that one should always speak about Kåñëa. Satataàkértayanto mäm [Bg. 9.14]. One should always speak about the SupremePersonality of Godhead, glorifying His holy name, fame, pastimes, entourage,and so on. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam also it is stated, çrotavyaù kértitavyaç cadhyeyaù püjyaç ca nityadä. One should always hear about, glorify, meditateupon and worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. In thetwenty-first verse of this chapter it was stated, çäbde pare ca niñëätam. Thebona fide spiritual master is expert in çäbde pare, or the transcendental soundvibration describing the spiritual world. One cannot artificially remainempty-headed or speechless, as advocated by foolish proponents of concoctedsystems of meditation and yoga. But one should be so absorbed in the lovingservice of Kåñëa, and so lovingly attracted to praising Kåñëa, that one has not asingle moment free to speak nonsense. That is the purport of the word maunam.</div>
<div class="First">Svädhyäyam means that one should study Vedic literature according to hisindividual ability and also teach others. In Bhagavad-gétä it is mentioned that abrähmaëa should have the qualities of jïäna and vijïäna, scriptural knowledgeand practical realized application of knowledge. Specifically one should studythose books which increase one's desire to serve the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. His Divine Grace Oà Viñëupäda Paramahaàsa ParivräjakäcäryaAñöottara-çata Çré Çrémad Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda has written in afew short years a veritable library of transcendental knowledge. It is beingpractically seen throughout the world that when the principle of svädhyäyam,or Vedic study, is applied to these books, such as Çrémad-Bhägavatam,Bhagavad-gétä As It Is, Caitanya-caritämåta and The Nectar of Devotion, thesincere reader becomes infused with the ecstatic determination to serve theSupreme Personality of Godhead. The entire International Society for KrishnaConsciousness is expanding all over the world on the basis of thistranscendental literature. Svädhyäyam does not indicate speculative orimaginary interpretations of religious scriptures, nor should one try to readmany books to increase his false prestige as a so-called scholar. One shouldread those books which inspire practical spiritual advancement in knowledgeand renunciation, as exemplified by the books of Çréla Prabhupäda.The word ärjavam indicates simplicity or straightforwardness. According toÇréla Çrédhara Svämé svacchatäm, or "clarity, transparency," is a synonym forstraightforwardness. Unless one is pure in consciousness he will adopt manycrooked means. Straightforwardness does not indicate that one should insultothers in the name of honesty, but that one should speak the humble truth.The word brahmacaryam, or "celibacy," indicates either renouncing completelythe association of women or following strictly the Vedic principles ofhouseholder life, which regulate sex life for the purpose of procreating saintlychildren. Ahiàsäm indicates that one should not commit violence against anyliving entity. Unless one is aware of the subtle laws of karma, by which a livingbeing enjoys and suffers, one cannot actually practice ahiàsä, or nonviolence.Ultimately the material world is full of violence, and the laws of nature, whichimpose old age, disease and death upon every living creature, are themselvesfilled with violence. Therefore, if somehow or other one can convince othersto surrender to Kåñëa and thus release themselves from the violent laws of material nature, that is the perfection of ahiàsä.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> One should practice meditation by constantly seeing oneself to be an eternal cognizant spirit soul and seeing the Lord to be the absolute controller of everything. To increase one's meditation, one should live in a secluded place and give up false attachment to one's home and household paraphernalia. Giving up the decorations of the temporary material body, one should dress himself with scraps of cloth found in rejected places, or with the bark of trees. In this way one should learn to be satisfied in any material situation.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Kaivalyam, or living in a secluded place, indicates a place free from materialdisturbances. Therefore, one should live in the association of Vaiñëavas, wherethe common goal is advancement in Kåñëa consciousness. Especially in theKali-yuga, if one tries to remain physically isolated from all others the resultwill be degradation or insanity. Aniketatäm means that one should not beintoxicated by the ephemeral satisfaction of one's "home sweet home," whichwill vanish at any moment by the unforeseen circumstances produced by one'sprevious activities. In this age it is not actually possible to dress in tree bark inmodern cities, nor to wear mere scraps of cloth. Previously, human cultureaccommodated those practicing tapasya, or penances in the interest of spiritualadvancement. In this age, however, the most urgent necessity is for preachingthe message of Bhagavad-gétä throughout human society. Therefore, it isrecommended that Vaiñëavas dress with clean and neat cloth, covering thebody decently so that the conditioned souls will not be frightened or repulsedby the severe penances of the Vaiñëavas. In the Kali-yuga the conditionedsouls are extremely attached to material sense gratification, and extremeausterities are not appreciated, but are instead considered abominable denialsof the flesh. Of course, austerity is required for spiritual advancement, but thepractical example set by Çréla Prabhupäda in successfully spreading the Kåñëaconsciousness movement was that all material things should be used to attractpeople to Kåñëa consciousness. Therefore, Vaiñëavas may at times adoptordinary dress to serve the higher principle of distributing Kåñëaconsciousness. In any case, one should learn to be satisfied in any materialsituation so as to prepare for the moment of death. According toBhagavad-gétä, at the time of death the particular consciousness we havecreated in this life will carry us to our future situation. Therefore, human lifecan be seen as a type of practice for successfully fixing one's mind on the Absolute Truth during the severe trials of death.</div>

One should rigidly control his mind, speech and bodily activities, always speak the truth, and bring the mind and senses under full control.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The definition of çraddhä, or faith, is given as follows in Caitanya-caritämåta (Madhya 22.62):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">'çraddhä'-çabde-viçväsa kahe sudåòha niçcaya</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kåñëe bhakti kaile sarva-karma kåta haya</div>
<div class="First">"By rendering transcendental loving service to Kåñëa, one automaticallyperforms all subsidiary activities. This confident, firm faith, favorable to thedischarge of devotional service, is called "çraddhä." Thus a devotee should beconfident that by carrying out the injunctions of bhägavata-çästra, or Vedicliterature that directly, rather than indirectly, describes devotional service tothe Supreme Personality of Godhead, one will easily achieve all knowledge and the perfection of life.</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura,</div>
<div class="First">mano-väk-käya-daëòam, or strict control of the mind, speech and bodilyactivities, means mänasa-väcika-käyika-vikarma-rähityam; that is, one shouldrigidly abandon all sinful activities with his mind, speech and body. As ÇrélaPrabhupäda has repeatedly pointed out, sense control does not mean stoppingsensory activities, thus becoming like a dead body, but rather engaging one'smental, vocal and bodily activities in the service of Kåñëa. Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">has stated,</div>

<div class="First">"A person acting in Kåñëa consciousness, in the service of Kåñëa, with hisbody, mind, intelligence and words is a liberated person, even within thematerial world, although he may be engaged in many so-called materialactivities." (Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 1.2.187) Thus one can achievevikarma-rähityam, or freedom from unauthorized, sinful activities, by engagingone's senses, mind, intelligence and speech twenty-four hours daily in theservice of Kåñëa. In Bhagavad-gétä Lord Kåñëa says that only those pious livingentities who are vikarma-rahita, completely free from sinful life, can achievefreedom from the illusory duality of material nature (samatvaà</div>

<div class="First">"Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinfulactions are completely eradicated and who are freed from the duality ofdelusion engage themselves in My service with determination." (Bg. 7.28) Inhis purport to this verse, His Divine Grace Çréla Prabhupäda has stated, "Thoseeligible for elevation to the transcendental position are mentioned in thisverse. For those who are sinful, atheistic, foolish and deceitful, it is verydifficult to transcend the duality of desire and hate. Only those who havepassed their lives in practicing the regulative principles of religion, who haveacted piously and have conquered sinful reactions can accept devotionalservice and gradually rise to the pure knowledge of the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. Then, gradually, they can meditate in trance on the SupremePersonality of Godhead. That is the process of being situated on the spiritualplatform. This elevation is possible in Kåñëa consciousness in the association of pure devotees who can deliver one from delusion."</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted the following statement from the BrahmäëòaPuräëa: "One should have complete faith in transcendental literature such asÇrémad-Bhägavatam and other literature that directly glorifies the SupremePersonality of Godhead. One should also have faith in Vaiñëava tantras, theoriginal Vedas, and Mahäbhärata, which includes Bhagavad-gétä and which isconsidered the fifth Veda. The Vedic knowledge originally emanated from thebreathing of Viñëu, and Vedic literature has been compiled in literary form byÇréla Vyäsadeva, the incarnation of Viñëu. Therefore, Lord Viñëu should beunderstood to be the personal speaker of all this Vedic literature."There are other Vedic literatures, called kalä-vidyä, which giveinstructions in material arts and sciences. Since all such Vedic arts andsciences are ultimately intended to be used to render devotional service to theSupreme Personality of Godhead, Keçava, saintly persons in the renouncedorder of life should never blaspheme such apparently mundane literatures;because such literatures are indirectly connected with the Supreme Lord, onemay go to hell for blaspheming these secondary literatures."Çraddhä indicates a faithful mentality, which can be analyzed in twosections. The first type of faith is a firm conviction that all the statements ofthe multifarious Vedic literatures are true. In other words, the understandingthat Vedic knowledge in general is infallible is called çraddhä, or faith. Asecond type of faith is the belief that one must personally carry out a particularinjunction of Vedic literature in order to achieve his goal in life. A devotee ofthe Supreme Lord should thus apply the first type of faith to the variouskalä-vidyäs, or Vedic material arts and sciences, but he should not accept suchscriptures as pointing out his personal goal in life. Nor should he carry out anyVedic injunction that is contradictory to the injunctions of Vaiñëava scriptures such as the Païcarätra.</div>
<div class="First">"Thus one should faithfully accept all Vedic literature as directly orindirectly describing the Supreme Personality of Godhead and should notblaspheme any portion of it. Even for Lord Brahmä, as well as for othercreatures, down to the insignificant unmoving species such as trees and stones,blasphemy of any Vedic literature causes one to merge into the darkness ofignorance. Thus the suras—the demigods, great sages and devotees of theLord—should understand that the Païcarätric literatures, as well as the fourVedas, the original Rämäyaëa, the Çrémad-Bhägavatam and other Puräëas, andthe Mahäbhärata, are Vedic literatures that establish the supremacy of theSupreme Personality of Godhead and the unique transcendental position ofthe Lord's devotees according to their status of spiritual advancement. Anyother vision of Vedic literatures is to be considered an illusion. In allauthorized religious scriptures the ultimate goal is to understand that theSupreme Personality of Godhead is the controller of everything and everyone,and that the Lord's devotees are not different from Him, although suchdevotees are to be understood in terms of their level of spiritual advancement."Lord Kåñëa has stated in Bhagavad-gétä, vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyo/vedänta-kåd veda-vid eva cäham: "By all the Vedas, I am to be known; indeed, Iam the compiler of Vedänta, and I am the knower of the Vedas." Similarly, the Lord states:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yasmät kñaram atéto 'ham</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">akñaräd api cottamaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ato 'smi loke vede ca</div>

<div class="First">"Because I am transcendental, beyond both the fallible and the infallible, andbecause I am the greatest, I am celebrated both in the world and in the Vedas as the Supreme Person." (Bg. 15.18)</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura mentions that one cannot developthe godly qualities mentioned in the preceding verses unless one accepts theshelter of the lotus feet of a bona fide Vaiñëava spiritual master. Tasmädguruà prapadyeta jijïäsuù çreya uttamam [SB 11.3.21]. In this connection, he has quoted the following statement:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">arcayitvä tu govindaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tadéyän närcayet tu yaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na sa bhägavato jïeyaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kevalaà dämbhikaù småtaù</div>
<div class="First">"One who performs worship of Lord Govinda but fails to worship His devoteesshould be understood to be not a devotee of the Lord but simply a victim offalse pride." For one who has accepted shelter at the lotus feet of a puredevotee of Kåñëa, it is very easy to execute worship of the Lord Himself.For such a surrendered soul there is no need of artificial penances andausterities. In this regard Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has quoted the following (from Närada Païcarätra):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ärädhito yadi haris tapasä tataù kià</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">narädhito yadi haris tapasä tataù kim</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">antar bahir yadi haris tapasä tataù kià</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">näntar bahir yadi haris tapasä tataù kim</div>
<div class="First">"If one is worshiping Lord Hari, what is the use of performing extraneouspenances? And if one is not worshiping Lord Hari, no such penances will saveone. If one can understand that Lord Hari is all-pervading, within andwithout, what is the need of performing penances? And if one is not able tounderstand that Hari is all-pervading, all his penances are useless." A Vaiñëavais always absorbed in executing his devotional service to Kåñëa. If a devoteebecomes falsely proud of executing severe penances and austerities andmeditates on accepting and rejecting material objects instead of thinking ofhis service to Kåñëa, his so-called austerities become an impediment to devotional service.</div>
<div class="First">A devotee should not be disturbed by the word jugglery of those who areagainst the devotional service of the Lord. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta SarasvatéÖhäkura has emphatically pointed out that devotional service to the lotus feetof the Supreme Lord is the only means of achieving the final perfection of life.Therefore a Vaiñëava should practice maunam, or silence, by ignoring thoseliteratures which are full of false arguments, such as those of the Mäyävädaschool, and those karma-käëòa scriptures which promote sense gratification inthe name of religious life. If one becomes overwhelmed by mundaneunhappiness due to not achieving immediate success in self-realization, or ifone becomes deluded by sense gratification and tries to take shelter ofmaterialistic men and doctrines, one's devotional progress will immediately bechecked. Similarly, if a devotee expresses love for things separate from Kåñëaor tries to find fault in the process of devotional service or the philosophy ofBhagavad-gétä in order to justify absorbing himself in the sense gratification ofseeing things separate from Kåñëa, his progress in spiritual enlightenment willbe seriously disturbed. Such an illusory concept is called dvitéyäbhiniveça, orabsorption in illusion. On the other hand, if one is attracted to the vibrationof Vedic sound by the consensus of self-realized authorities called thevaiñëava-paramparä and thus engages enthusiastically in kåñëa-näma-kértana,or chanting the holy names of the Lord, then one's practice of mauna, or silence, is perfect.</div>
<div class="First">One should avoid prajalpa, or whimsical conversations unrelated todevotional service. Merely restraining the senses artificially without chantingand hearing the glories of the Supreme Lord cannot be considered the spiritualperfection. The example is given that although many domestic animals in thebarnyard are sometimes forced to practice celibacy when isolated from oneanother, such animals cannot be considered brahmacärés, or spiritual students.Similarly, one is not considered spiritually advanced simply because of dryspeculative arguments or temporary austerities. One must submissively hearthe message of the Vedic sound vibration, especially as it is summarized inBhagavad-gétä by the Lord Himself. Vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù [Bg. 15.15].</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has warned us that if one becomesattracted to nontheistic ethical philosophies, such as those of the Buddhistsand Jains, which glorify such mundane principles as ahiàsä, or nonviolence,one's mundane faith in godless ethics is spiritually suicidal. To restrict thesenses by artificial austerities and to undertake huge social arrangements tofacilitate mass sense gratification are both godless attempts to regulate humansociety in an artificial way that hides the eternal relationship of every livingbeing with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the natural leader of society.When so-called moral philosophers spoil the opportunity of human life, theopportunity to revive our eternal relationship with Kåñëa, in the name ofethics such foolish persons commit the greatest violence against humansociety. Therefore, Kåñëadäsa Kaviräja Gosvämé has said,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">çré-kåñëa-caitanya-dayä karaha vicära</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">vicära karile citte päbe camatkära</div>
<div class="First">"If you are indeed interested in logic and argument, kindly apply them to themercy of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. If you do so, you will find such mercy strikingly wonderful." (Cc. Ädi 8.15)</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura a mahä-bhägavata,or pure devotee of the Lord, is one who sees that both the material andspiritual worlds are nondifferent from Lord Kåñëa, being expansions of Hispotency, but also sees that Vrajendranandana, Kåñëa, keeps Himself eternallydistinct by His unique quality of all-attractiveness. Thus a pure devotee of theLord is aniketana, without a fixed residence, meaning that he accepts neitherthe gross nor subtle body as his eternal residence. Since one's so-called homeand family are expansions of his body, such material creations are also not tobe considered one's actual residence. Caitanya Mahäprabhu said,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ayi nanda-tanuja kiìkaraà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">patitaà mäm viñame bhavämbudhau</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kåpayä tava päda-paìkajasthita-</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">dhülé-sadåçaà vicintaya</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">[Cc. Antya 20.32, Çikñäñöaka 5]</div>
<div class="First">"O Kåñëa, son of Mahäräja Nanda, I am Your eternal servitor, yet somehow orother I have fallen into the ocean of birth and death. Please pick me up fromthis ocean of death and place me as one of the atoms at Your lotus feet."(Çikñäñöaka 5) Thus a devotee should understand that his eternal residence isfixed in the dust of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. AVaiñëava should reject the gross sense gratification of living in the forest inthe mode of goodness, in the city in the mode of passion, or in the gamblinghouse in ignorance. A pure devotee may travel all over the world distributingKåñëa consciousness, but he should never consider any material place to be hisactual residence. One who has become mature in this understanding may takethe tridaëòa-sannyäsa order of life under the direct shelter of the Lord.The impersonalist cannot understand how the devotee of the Lord,although fixed in the duality of seeing himself as eternally different from theLord, sees all existence as nondifferent from the Lord. Those who attempt toacquire knowledge by impersonal speculation based on their tiny experience ofthe material cosmic manifestation cannot understand the transcendentalreality of acintya-bhedäbheda-tattva(93), the Absolute Truth's simultaneousoneness with and difference from His creation. The process of assimilating thistranscendental knowledge is given in these verses, starting with tasmäd guruàprapadyeta [SB 11.3.21]. One is recommended to accept a bona fide spiritualmaster and serve him according to the direction of these verses. The essence ofsuch instructions is that one should abandon the association of Mäyävädéimpersonalists, ritualistic fruitive workers and those who are whimsicallyindifferent to the ultimate purpose of life, and instead one should devotehimself to associating with the devotees of the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. A falsely proud neophyte may imagine himself a great devotee of theLord without taking to the company of the Lord's followers, but without suchassociation it is not possible to become advanced in Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">In Bhagavad-gétä (9.27) Lord Kåñëa has ordered,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yat karoñi yad açnäsi</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yaj juhoñi dadäsi yat</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yat tapasyasi kaunteya</div>

<div class="First">"O son of Kunté, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and giveaway, and all austerities that you perform should be done as an offering untoMe." Çréla Prabhupäda has commented on this verse as follows: "Thus, it is theduty of everyone to mold his life in such a way that he will not forget Kåñëa inany circumstance. Everyone has to work for maintenance of his body and soultogether, and Kåñëa recommends herein that one should work for Him.Everyone has to eat something to live; therefore he should accept theremnants of foodstuffs offered to Kåñëa. Any civilized man has to performsome religious ritualistic ceremonies; therefore Kåñëa recommends, 'Do it forMe,' and this is called arcanam. Everyone has a tendency to give something incharity; Kåñëa says, 'Give it to Me,' and this means that all surplus moneyaccumulated should be utilized in furthering the Kåñëa consciousnessmovement. Nowadays people are very much inclined to the meditationalprocess, which is not practical in this age, but if anyone practices meditatingon Kåñëa twenty-four hours by chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra round hisbeads, he is surely the greatest yogé, as substantiated by the Sixth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä."</div>
<div class="First">Many persons who become attracted to the devotional service of Kåñëa arebewildered by the material possessions, reputation or skills they haveaccumulated by their previous material activities. According to Çréla JévaGosvämé these two verses indicate that all such material opulencesaccumulated by one's previous karma should be used as an offering to theSupreme Personality of Godhead. One's fame, education, wealth and so onshould all be used to carry out the mission of the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. Sometimes envious materialists ask why one should waste one'swealth and education in the Lord's service when such things could be betterused to gratify the temporary material body. Actually, however, whatever wepossess, including this body, is ultimately the property of the Supreme Lord,who is the creator, maintainer and annihilator of all existence. Therefore, oneshould be blessed by dovetailing one's so-called opulences in the devotionalservice of the Lord. Otherwise, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä, måtyuù sarva-haraçcäham: [Bg. 10.34] the Supreme Lord will appear before us at the time of deathas måtyu, death personified, and violently take away all of our possessions.Therefore, such possessions should be peacefully offered to the lotus feet of theLord while we are still living and able to enjoy the pious result of such an offering.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, tapaù, austerity, meansthat one should observe vows such as Ekädaçé-vrata, in which one fasts fromgrains and beans twice a month. The word japtam refers to chanting the holynames of the Lord, such as Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. Çréla Viçvanätha CakravartéÖhäkura has further pointed out that one can offer one's wife, children andhome to the Lord by converting one's family into devotees of the SupremeLord. Rather than becoming artificially puffed up in the pursuit of so-calledstatus symbols, one's family should be trained to understand that they areeternal servants of the Supreme Lord. And when the entire family becomesdedicated to the Lord's service, a very beautiful situation is created.Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has pointed out that if a humanbeing is not initiated into the process of bhägavata-dharma he must dependupon the uncertain knowledge derived from his gross material senses.Indifferent to the sublime descriptions of the Lord's eternal appearances,pastimes and innumerable transcendental qualities, the faithless materialistwanders about on the platform of mundane enjoyment. But if one canunderstand the reality of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He isdescribed in authorized Vedic literature, then one should accept the order oftridaëòa-sannyäsa, or at least one should practice restraint of the body, mindand words and thus become self-controlled and fixed in the Absolute Truth.Then all of one's desires, all the charity he gives, and his penances andchanting of mantras-in other words, his entire personality, his home, hischildren, his wife and his very life air—become heartfelt offerings to theSupreme Lord. When a living entity constantly hears the authorizeddescriptions of the Supreme Lord and dovetails all of his activities in theLord's service, avoiding other activities, he is considered to be fixed on the platform of bhägavata-dharma.</div>

<div class="Translation"> One should learn how to associate with the devotees of the Lord by gathering with them to chant the glories of the Lord. This process is most purifying.

<div class="First">According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, those who are advanced in Kåñëaconsciousness should not envy one another or quarrel among themselves.Giving up all such mundane feelings, they should gather together and chantthe glories of the Supreme Lord for mutual purification. Çréla ViçvanäthaCakravarté Öhäkura has pointed out that glorification of the Supreme Lord isespecially potent when performed in the association of pure devotees. Whendevotees engage in saìkértana, chanting the glories of the Lord together, theyexperience the highest transcendental bliss and satisfaction. Thus theyencourage one another to give up material sense gratification, which is basedon illicit sexual connections with women. One devotee will say to another,"Oh, you have given up sense gratification. Starting today, I shall also give it up."</div>
<div class="First">One should learn to increase one's love for the devotees, to satisfy them andto give up sense objects unfavorable to serving Kåñëa. And one should learn toview the entire universe as paraphernalia for the Lord's service. By engagingthe objects of the senses in Kåñëa's service, one automatically becomesdetached from them. And as one passes one's days in the association of theLord's devotees, one's transcendental ecstasy increases more and more, throughdiscussions about the topics of Çrémad-Bhägavatam and Bhagavad-gétä.Therefore, one who wants to be free from the harassment of mäyä in the formof sense gratification must constantly associate with pure devotees of the Lordwho have no engagement other than chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord and carrying out His mission on earth.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Madhväcärya has pointed out that just as one should cultivatefriendship with devotees, one must cultivate a spirit of friendship toward thedemigods, who manage the universe on the Lord's behalf. Thus one should live peacefully within this world.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The devotees of the Lord constantly discuss the glories of the Personality of Godhead among themselves. Thus they constantly remember the Lord and remind one another of His qualities and pastimes. In this way, by their devotion to the principles of bhakti-yoga, the devotees please the Personality of Godhead, who takes away from them everything inauspicious. Being purified of all impediments, the devotees awaken to pure love of Godhead, and thus, even within this world, their spiritualized bodies exhibit symptoms of transcendental ecstasy, such as standing of the bodily hairs on end.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The word aghaugha-haram is very significant in this verse. Agha refers tothat which is inauspicious or sinful. The living entity is actuallysac-cid-änanda-vigraha [Bs. 5.1], or eternal and full of bliss and knowledge, butby neglecting his eternal relationship with Kåñëa, the Personality of Godhead,he commits sinful activities and undergoes the inauspicious result in the formof material suffering. The chain of sinful reactions is called ogha, or arelentless wave of suffering. Kåñëa is aghaugha-haraà harim; He takes awaythe sinful reactions of His devotees, who are thus entitled to experience theinconceivable bliss of the kingdom of God even while remaining in this world.The words bhaktyä saïjätayä bhaktyä indicate that there are two divisionsof bhakti-yoga: sädhana-bhakti and rägänuga-bhakti. Çréla Prabhupäda haselaborately explained in his book The Nectar of Devotion the progress of thedevotee from sädhana-bhakti, or the execution of regulative principles, torägänuga-bhakti, or service executed in love of Godhead. According to ÇrélaBhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, a liberated soul is always enthusiastic dueto the appearance of transcendental ecstasy within his body. Thus he alwaysaspires to remain overwhelmed in chanting the glories of the Personality of Godhead, Hari.</div>

Then what will I do, where will I go, from whomshall I inquire, and who can possibly help me reach Kåñëa?" Hasanti: It is lateat night, the sky is dark, and Kåñëa is determined to steal from the house ofone of the elderly gopés. He is hiding underneath a tree in the corner of thecourtyard belonging to one of the cowherd men. Although Kåñëa thinks thatHe is completely concealed, He suddenly hears a voice from one of the elderlymembers of the family. "Who are You there? Who are You? I say." Thus Kåñëahas been caught, and He begins to flee the courtyard. When this humorousscene is revealed to the devotee, the devotee begins to laugh heartily.Nandanti: When Kåñëa actually reveals His transcendental form to thedevotee, the devotee experiences the highest transcendental bliss. Vadanti:The devotee says to the Lord, "O Kåñëa, after so many days I have finally achieved You."</div>
<div class="First">When all of the devotee's senses are absorbed in Çré Kåñëa, the devotee hassuccessfully transcended the material condition of life. This is indicated by theword alaukikäù. Alaukikäù, or the transcendental platform, is explained by the Lord in Bhagavad-gétä (14.26):</div>

This ecstaticsymptom was manifested by the gopés in Våndävana during Kåñëa's absence.In the twenty-first verse of this chapter it was stated that one who hasunderstood that there is no happiness either on earth or in material heavenmust surrender at the lotus feet of a bona fide spiritual master. Tasmäd guruàprapadyeta jijïäsuù çreya uttamam [SB 11.3.21]. The following verses gave manydetailed instructions regarding the activities of a bona fide disciple. Now thisverse is describing the mature fruit of devotional service, namely, pure love ofGodhead. Everyone has the opportunity to come to this platform oftranscendental bliss by taking the dust of the lotus feet of Kåñëa'srepresentative on his head. One should give up the mentality of envy and falseprestige and humbly take shelter of the mercy of the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. The spiritual master is to be considered the incarnation of the Lord'smercy. There is absolutely no doubt that a sincere soul who serves a bona fidespiritual master will achieve the highest perfection of life (çreya uttamam).

Therefore, in this verse the King is requesting specificinformation about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Näräyaëa. It issignificant in this verse that the King refers to the Supreme Lord as Näräyaëa,Brahman and Paramätmä. Although King Nimi is already understood to be adevotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by his question he wants toclarify that the Personality of Godhead is the highest transcendental truth.

<div class="First">"Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this nondualsubstance Brahman, Paramätmä or Bhagavän." Therefore it is to be understoodthat the word näräyaëa in this verse refers to the Bhagavän feature of the Supreme Lord in the spiritual world.</div>
<div class="First">Generally the speculative philosophers become attracted to the impersonalBrahman feature of the Absolute Truth, whereas the mystic yogés meditateupon the Paramätmä, the Supersoul within everyone's heart. On the otherhand, those who have achieved mature transcendental knowledge surrenderdirectly to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagavän, who is eternallysituated in His own abode, called Vaikuëöha-dhäma. In Bhagavad-gétä LordKåñëa clearly says, brahmaëo hi pratiñöhäham: "I am the source of theimpersonal Brahman." Similarly, it is described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam that theSupersoul, Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, is a secondary plenary expansion of theSupreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the previous verse King Nimi inquired about various aspects of theAbsolute Truth, namely Näräyaëa, Brahman and Paramätmä. Now the sageÇré Pippaläyana explains these three features of the Absolute Truth in thesame order in which the King mentioned them. Sthity-udbhava-pralaya-hetuùrefers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who expands Himself as thetriple puruña incarnations-Mahä-Viñëu, Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu andKñérodakaçäyé Viñëu. As described in the Bhägavatam (1.3.1):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">jagåhe pauruñaà rüpaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhagavän mahad-ädibhiù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sambhütaà ñoòaça-kalam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ädau loka-sisåkñayä</div>
<div class="First">"In the beginning of the creation, the Lord first expanded Himself in theuniversal form of the puruña incarnation and manifested all the ingredients forthe material creation. And thus at first there was the creation of the sixteenprinciples of material action. This was for the purpose of creating the materialuniverse." Thus the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Näräyaëa, is mentionedhere as hetuù, or the supreme cause of the creation, maintenance andannihilation of the cosmic situation. Still, there is no cause of the LordHimself; He is ahetuù. As expressed in the Brahma-saàhitä, anädir ädirgovindaù sarva-käraëa-käraëam [Bs. 5.1]. The Supreme Lord is the cause of allcauses, and being the eternal Absolute Truth, He has no cause of Himself. Theword ahetuù has also been explained by Çréla Jéva Gosvämé to indicate that theSupreme Lord has His original form as Kåñëa in His own transcendental abode,called Kåñëaloka. Since Kåñëa is always engaged in His blissful pastimes in thecompany of His eternally liberated associates, He is aloof from the affairs ofthis world, which is created by His external potency, known as mäyä.Therefore it is stated, jagåhe pauruñaà rüpam. The Lord expands Himself asNäräyaëa and Viñëu to facilitate the gross illusion and gradual rectification ofthe conditioned souls. The Lord's aloofness from the material creation is alsodescribed in the Vedas: na tasya käryaà karaëaà ca vidyate. The AbsoluteTruth has nothing to do, since everything is done self-sufficiently by Hismultipotencies. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has pointed out thateven though the Supreme Lord Kåñëa is ahetuù, or causeless and aloof from thecause of material creation, the Lord is also described in this verse as hetuù, orthe ultimate cause of the creation, maintenance and annihilation of thematerial manifestation, because He expands Himself as Paramätmä, or theSupersoul, who acts as the prime mover of the cosmic manifestation.The word ahetuù may also be understood in another way. In Bhagavad-gétä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">(7.5) the Lord says,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">apareyam itas tv anyäà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">prakåtià viddhi me paräm</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">jéva-bhütäà mahä-bäho</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yayedaà dhäryate jagat</div>
<div class="First">The conditioned living entities (jéva-bhüta) desire to engage in sensegratification with their material senses (manaù-ñañöhänéndriyäëi prakåti-sthänikarñati [Bg. 15.7]). Thus the creation of the material world becomes necessary.In fact, the material cosmic manifestation continues to exist because of thedesires of the conditioned souls to exploit it (yayedaà dhäryate jagat [Bg. 7.5]).The government must create a prison to accommodate those citizens who areinclined to criminal activity. There is no need for any citizen to live in theobnoxious conditions of the prison, but because a certain portion of thepopulation is inclined toward antisocial behavior, the prison becomesnecessary. In a higher sense, the prisoners themselves can be considered thehetuù, or the cause, for the construction of the prison. Similarly, the SupremePersonality of Godhead expands His internal potency according to His owndesire to increase the änanda, or transcendental bliss, of Himself and His puredevotees, but He manifests the material universe in response to the illicitdesires of the conditioned souls to live a life of sense gratification in willfulforgetfulness of Him. Therefore the conditioned living entities themselves canbe considered the hetuù, or cause, of the material manifestation. The externalpotency of the Lord, mäyä, who is charged with the duty of materialmanifestation, is called chäyä, or the shadow of the Lord's internal potency.Såñöi-sthiti-pralaya-sädhana-çaktir eka/ chäyeva yasya bhuvanäni bibharti durgä[Bs. 5.44]. The Lord does not personally desire to manifest the shadow potency,called Durgä or mäyä. The blissful spiritual planets, eternally manifest, containthe best possible facilities for the living entities who are parts and parcels ofthe Lord. But the conditioned souls, rejecting the inconceivable, eternal livingarrangements the Lord has kindly provided, prefer to seek their misfortune inthe shadow kingdom called the material world. Thus, both Durgä and theconditioned living entities may be considered the hetuù, or cause, of thematerial manifestation. Since Lord Kåñëa is ultimately sarva-käraëa-käraëam[Bs. 5.1], the cause of all causes, He is to be known as the ultimate supremecause. But how the Lord functions as the supreme cause of the materialmanifestation (sthity-udbhava-pralaya-hetuù) is described in the ThirteenthChapter of Bhagavad-gétä. Upadrañöänumantä ca: the Lord acts as overseer andpermitter. The actual desire of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is statedvery clearly in Bhagavad-gétä: sarva-dharmän parityajya mäm ekaà çaraëaàvraja [Bg. 18.66]. The Lord desires every living entity to give up the shadowpotency mäyä and return to the actual substance (västavaà vastu), which is the eternal kingdom of God.</div>
<div class="First">Although various aspects of the Absolute Truth are being described, theAbsolute Truth is ultimately one, as stated in this verse (tad avehi paraànarendra). King Nimi inquired about Brahman, and now this verse says, yatsvapna-jägara-susuptiñu sad bahiç ca. The Lord's all-pervading feature withinwakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep, and His existence beyond these threemental states, are understood to be manifestations of Brahman, the spiritualpotency of the Lord. Finally, the statement dehendriyäsu-hådayäëi caranti yenasaïjévitäni can be understood to refer to the Paramätmä feature of the Lord.When the Lord expands Himself as Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, the third of the threeViñëu features, and enters the heart of every living entity, the gross and subtleorgans of the body become enlivened for continuing the chain of fruitive activity called karma.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the multifariousmanifestations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead do not compromise Hissupremacy as one without a second. The Absolute Truth isparamavyoma-nätha, or the Lord of the spiritual sky, who appears as two-armedÇyämasundara, as four-armed, as eight-armed or as having one thousand arms.In each aspect His body is eternal and full of bliss and knowledge(sac-cid-änanda-mürti). He appears on earth as Väsudeva and within theCausal Ocean as Mahä-Viñëu. He lies on the Milk Ocean as KñérodakaçäyéViñëu and rescues His helpless young devotee as Nåsiàhadeva. Appearing asLord Rämacandra, He acts. as a perfect king. And appearing as Kåñëa He stealsthe heart of everyone, and especially of young beautiful women. All thesefeatures of the Lord are indicated by the word Näräyaëa, or the SupremePersonality of Godhead, just as the word president indicates not only theofficial duties of the president but his personal family life and long intimatefriendships as well. According to Çrémad-Bhägavatam, kåñëas tu bhagavänsvayam [SB 1.3.28]. When one transcends an official understanding of theSupreme Personality of Godhead and comes to the superior status of love ofGod, one can understand the Lord to be Kåñëa, the cause of all causes. Theinnumerable Viñëu expansions of the Lord are also understood to be plenaryportions of Çré Kåñëa. Kåñëas tu bhagavän svayam. As the Lord Himself statesin Bhagavad-gétä, ahaà sarvasya prabhavaù [Bg. 10.8].

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Neither the mind nor the faculties of speech, sight, intelligence, the life air or any of the senses are capable of penetrating that Supreme Truth, any more than small sparks can affect the original fire from which they are generated. Not even the authoritative language of the Vedas can perfectly describe the Supreme Truth, since the Vedas themselves disclaim the possibility that the Truth can be expressed by words. But through indirect reference the Vedic sound does serve as evidence of the Supreme Truth, since without the existence of that Supreme Truth the various restrictions found in the Vedas would have no ultimate purpose.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The small sparks generated by a blazing fire have no power to illuminate theoriginal fire, nor can they burn it. The quantity of heat and light in theoriginal fire is always superior to the quantity found in the insignificantsparks. Similarly, the minute living entity is generated from the internalpotency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as stated in Vedänta-sütra(janmädy asya yataù [SB 1.1.1]) and Bhagavad-gétä (ahaà sarvasya prabhavaù[Bg. 10.8], mamaiväàço jéva-loke jéva-bhütaù sanätanaù [Bg. 15.7]). The minuteliving entities, being aàçaù, or sparks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,can never equal the Supreme Godhead in the quantity of their potency. Thequantity of knowledge and bliss in the Supreme Personality of Godhead isalways superior. Therefore, when a foolish conditioned soul tries to illuminatethe subject matter of the highest truth with his tiny brain, he merelyilluminates his own foolishness. The Personality of Godhead has personallyspoken Bhagavad-gétä, which is the blazing fire of perfect knowledge that burnsto ashes the insignificant speculations and theories of so-called philosophers and scientists regarding the ultimate truth.</div>
<div class="First">The Supreme Personality of Godhead is called Håñékeça, or the Lord ofeveryone's senses. Because the Personality of Godhead has supreme seeingpower, hearing power, touching power, smelling power and tasting power, theliving entities in a limited sense can also see, hear, touch, smell and taste, bythe mercy of Håñékeça. This idea is expressed in the Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad(4.4.18): präëasya präëam uta cakñuñaç cakñur uta çrotrasya çrotramannasyännaà manaso ye mano viduù. "The Supreme Truth is understood to bethe life air sustaining everyone's life air, the vision of everyone's eyes, thehearing power of the ear, and the sustenance of food itself." The obviousconclusion is that the Supreme Truth can be known by His own causelessmercy, and not by our foolish attempts to bring the all-pervading truth withinthe insignificant boundaries of our intelligence. It is stated in the TaittiréyaUpaniñad (2.4.1), yato väco nivartante apräpya manasä saha: "The descriptivepower of speech fails in the realm of the Supreme Truth, and the speculative power of the mind cannot achieve Him."</div>
<div class="First">But because such statements of Vedic çrutis are in themselves descriptionsof the Absolute Truth, one may consider such Vedic statements contradictory.Therefore, in this connection it is stated, çabdo 'pibodhaka-niñedhatayätma-mülam arthoktam äha: although the Vedic çruti(çabda) forbids us to speculate upon the Absolute Truth, such restrictiveinjunctions indirectly constitute positive assertions of the existence of thesupreme living entity. In fact, the Vedic restrictions are meant to save onefrom the false path of mental speculation and ultimately bring one to the pointof devotional surrender. As Lord Kåñëa Himself states in Bhagavad-gétä, vedaiçca sarvair aham eva vedyaù: [Bg. 15.15] by all Vedic literatures the SupremePersonality of Godhead is to be known. The assertion that a particular process,such as mental speculation, is useless (yato väco nivartante apräpya manasäsaha) constitutes an indirect assertion of the existence of a correct path ofachieving the Supreme. As Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has stated, sarvasyaniñedhasya sävadhitvät: "Every negative injunction is understood to have aspecific limit. Negative injunctions cannot be taken as applicable in all cases."For example, a negative injunction is that no living entity can be equal to orgreater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But Çrémad-Bhägavatamclearly states that because of the intense love of the residents of Våndävana forKåñëa, they sometimes assume a superior position. Thus mother Yaçodä bindsKåñëa with ropes, and the influential cowherd boys sometimes ride on theshoulders of Kåñëa or defeat Him in wrestling. Negative injunctions, therefore,may sometimes be adjusted according to the transcendental situation.Although the Absolute Truth is transcendental to the material creationand therefore beyond the scope of material senses, when those same materialsenses are saturated with love of Godhead they become spiritualized andempowered to perceive the Absolute Truth. As stated in Brahma-saàhitä</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">paçya me yogam aiçvaram</div>
<div class="First">"But you cannot see Me with your present eyes. Therefore I give you divineeyes by which you can behold My mystic opulence." Similarly,Çrémad-Bhägavatam describes many incidents in which the Supreme AbsoluteTruth revealed Himself to His devotee, as in the histories of PrahlädaMahäräja, Dhruva Mahäräja, Påthu Mahäräja, Kardama Muni, the Päëòavasand the gopés. Therefore, the Vedic assertions that the Absolute Truth isbeyond the power of the eyes refer to those who have not receivedtranscendental eyes by the mercy of the Personality of Godhead. But theLord's own transcendental senses, which are the source of our limited senses,are confirmed in the çruti, as in the following statement from the KenaUpaniñad (1.4): yad väcänabhyuditaà yena väg abhyudyate/ tad eva brahma tvaàviddhi nedaà yad idam upäsate. "Brahman, the Absolute, should be understoodto be that which cannot be ascertained by the material power of speech;speech itself is evinced by that Supreme Truth." By the statement yena vägabhyudyate, "our power of speech is expressed by the Absolute Truth," it isclearly expressed that the Absolute Truth has His own transcendental senses. Therefore He is called Håñékeça.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Närada Muni has stated, håñékena håñékeça-sevanaà bhaktir ucyate [Cc.Madhya 19.170]. Our senses cannot approach the Absolute Truth by their ownpower, but when engaged in loving devotional service to satisfy the Lord of thesenses, our limited senses must become connected with the Lord's unlimitedsenses, and thus by the Lord's mercy He can be understood.Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted the following statement from the Brahma-tarka:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">änando nedåçänanda</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ity ukte lokataù param</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">pratibhäti na cäbhäti</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yathävad darçanaà vinä</div>
<div class="First">"The transcendental bliss of the Absolute Truth cannot be compared to theordinary happiness of the material world." Similarly, in the Vedänta-sütra theAbsolute Truth is described as änandamaya, or full of bliss.According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, in this verse ÇréPippaläyana is more or less describing the impersonal feature of the AbsoluteTruth. The nine Yogendras were themselves devotees of the personal featureof the Lord, so King Nimi asked his question about the different features of theAbsolute Truth to clarify that the Personality of Godhead is the source of allthe variegated aspects of the advaya-jïäna, or transcendental reality. This isalso expressed by the following statement in çruti: taà tv aupaniñadaà puruñaàpåcchämi. "I am inquiring about that Supreme Person revealed in the Upaniñads."</div>
<div class="First">If the Absolute Truth were actually inaccessible by words, there would beno meaning to the Vedic literature, which consists of collections oftranscendental words. Since the Vedic descriptions of the truth are to betaken as infallible, it is impossible to maintain that the power of speech is in allcases unable to describe the truth. After all, the Vedic mantras themselves aremeant to be spoken and heard. Therefore, the injunction that neither themind nor speech can approach the Absolute Truth (naitan mano viçati väg uta)cannot be taken as applicable in all cases; rather, it is a warning to those whofoolishly try to encompass the Absolute Truth by their own puny speculativepowers. Since the Vedic injunctions, either positive or negative, are to betaken as realistic descriptions of the Absolute Truth, the process of hearingand repeating Vedic knowledge (çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù [SB 7.5.23]) can beunderstood as a separate process in which one's hearing and speaking powerbecomes spiritualized by submissive reception of transcendental knowledge.This process depends upon one's faith in the bona fide spiritual master, who isa devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore it is stated,</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">jïätum arhasi bhärata</div>
<div class="First">"That Supreme Truth, Parabrahman, expands itself into all the variegatednessof this universe. You should know it to be My own concentrated effulgence, OBhärata." The words jïätum arhasi, "you must know it," spoken by the LordHimself, indicate that the Absolute Truth is to be known, but one mustsurrender to the truth, rather than waste time in foolish speculation.Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has pointed out that according toauthorized statements of Vedic literature the Lord's transcendental form isunderstood to be brahmamaya, or completely spiritual, with no trace ofmaterial contamination. Therefore, in such statements asnélotpala-dala-çyämam, "the Lord's form is beautifully manifest with the hue ofdark blue lotus petals," it is understood that a transcendental dark blue color isbeing described. Still, the Lord is inconceivably merciful to His devotees, eventhose on the neophyte platform who are trying to come to the state of love ofGodhead. Therefore the Lord gradually purifies the senses of a conditionedsoul who is trying to understand Him, and eventually the Lord appears beforesuch a rectified servitor. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura,präkåta-nélotpala-varëatvena bhaktair dhyätam atädåçam api. In the beginning,being conditioned by previous materialistic activities, a devotee meditating onthe Lord's transcendental form may base his meditation on his experience ofmaterial forms and colors within this world. The Lord's transcendental formhas nothing to do with material forms and colors, but since the object of thismeditation is Kåñëa, such meditation will eventually be transformed intotranscendental experience of the actual form, color, activities, pastimes andentourage of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words,transcendental knowledge depends not on material logic but on the pleasure ofthe Personality of Godhead. If the Lord is pleased by His devotee's sincereattempt to understand Him, the Lord can immediately circumvent all theso-called technicalities of material logic and Vedic injunctions and revealHimself to His pure devotee. Unless one accepts this omnipotency of thePersonality of Godhead, there is no hope of approaching the Absolute Truth.Therefore it is stated in the Kaöha Upaniñad (1.3.12), dåçyate tv agryayäbuddhyä: the Absolute Truth is seen by transcendental intelligence.Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has pointed out that knowledgeacquired through the interaction of the material senses with the modes ofnature is merely hypothetical and not factual. Empirical knowledge deals withour ephemeral experience of the sense objects generated by material nature.For example, there are many wars currently going on because of a false conceptof nationalism. Similarly, there is conflict throughout the world, and greatworld leaders fight like cats and dogs for the economic development of theircountries. Thus, material language is used to designate temporary objectsperceived by the eyes, nose, tongue, touch and taste. This type of language andexperience is useless for approaching the Absolute Truth. But thetranscendental sound from the spiritual sky has a completely different effect.We should not foolishly try to use materially concocted language to includethe Supreme Personality of Godhead as an object of the material world. TheSupreme Lord is completely transcendental and is known as ätma-prakäça, orself-manifested. Therefore, as stated in the Padma Puräëa,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ataù çré-kåñëa-nämädi</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na bhaved grähyam indriyaiù</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">svayam eva sphuraty adaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">[Cc. Madhya 17.136]</div>
<div class="First">"Material senses cannot appreciate Kåñëa's holy name, form, qualities andpastimes. But when a conditioned soul is awakened to Kåñëa consciousness andrenders service by using his tongue to chant the Lord's holy name and taste theremnants of the Lord's food, the tongue is purified, and one gradually comes tounderstand who Kåñëa really is." If one surrenders to the Supreme Lord, takingshelter at His lotus feet, one's spiritualized senses gradually become empoweredto perceive the Lord. Mere empiricism and material logic have a limitedjurisdiction within the external energy of the Supreme Lord and cannot applyto those things which are eternal. In this regard, Çréla BhaktisiddhäntaSarasvaté Öhäkura has quoted the following verse from Çrémad-Bhägavatam (7.5.32):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">naiñäà matis tävad urukramäìghrià</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">spåçaty anarthäpagamo yad-arthaù</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">niñkiïcanänäà na våëéta yävat</div>
<div class="First">"Unless they smear upon their bodies the dust of the lotus feet of a Vaiñëavacompletely freed from material contamination, persons very much inclinedtoward materialistic life cannot be attached to the lotus feet of the Lord, whois glorified for His uncommon activities. Only by becoming Kåñëa consciousand taking shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord in this way can one be freed from material contamination."</div>
<div class="First">Although Çré Pippaläyana is expressing that the Absolute Truth cannot beapproached by material senses, the sage himself is describing the AbsoluteTruth with transcendental senses, and King Nimi is able to understand thistranscendental sound because he has surrendered at the lotus feet of puredevotees, the nava-yogendras. Therefore, one should not foolishly try tounderstand this verse out of context, in an impersonal way, but should followthe example of King Nimi, who was trying to understand how the SupremePersonality of Godhead is ultimately the source of everything.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Originally one, the Absolute, Brahman, comes to be known as threefold, manifesting itself as the three modes of material nature—goodness, passion and ignorance. Brahman further expands its potency, and thus the power to act and the power of consciousness become manifest, along with the false ego, which covers the identity of the conditioned living being. Thus, by the expansion of the multipotencies of the Absolute, the demigods, as the embodiment of knowledge, become manifest, along with the material senses, their objects, and the results of material activity, namely happiness and distress. In this way the manifestation of the material world takes place as the subtle cause and as the material effect visible in the appearance of gross material objects. Brahman, which is the source of all subtle and gross manifestations, is simultaneously transcendental to them, being absolute.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the previous verse the sage Pippaläyana described the Absolute, Brahman,as being beyond the range of material sense perception and mentalspeculation. At the same time, it was stated, ätma-mülam arthoktam äha yad-åtena niñedha-siddhiù: the negative injunctions of the Vedas indirectly indicatethe existence of the Absolute Truth. This Absolute Truth can be approachedby correct means. Now, in the present verse, it is clearly described that theAbsolute Truth possesses innumerable potencies (uru-çakti brahmaiva bhäti).Thus by the expansion of the Absolute Truth the gross and subtle features ofthe material world become manifest. As stated by Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, käryaàkäraëäd bhinnaà na bhavati: "The result is not different from its cause."Therefore, since the Absolute is eternal existence, this material world, beingthe potency of the Absolute, must also be accepted as real, although thevarious manifestations of the material world are temporary and thus illusory.The material world should be understood to consist of the bewilderinginteractions of real elements. The material world is not false in the imaginarysense of the Buddhists and Mäyävädés, who state that in fact the materialworld does not exist outside the mind of the observer. The material world, asthe potency of the Absolute, has real existence. But the living entity becomesbewildered by the temporary manifestations, foolishly taking them to bepermanent. Thus the material world functions as an illusory potency, causingthe living entity to forget the spiritual world, wherein life is eternal, full ofbliss and knowledge. Because the material world thus bewilders theconditioned soul, it is called illusory. When a magician performs his tricksonstage, that which the audience apparently sees is an illusion. But themagician actually exists, and the hat and rabbit exist, although the appearanceof a rabbit coming out of a hat is an illusion. Similarly, when the living entityidentifies himself as part and parcel of the material world, thinking, "I amAmerican," "I am Indian," "I am Russian," "I am black," "I am white," he isbewildered by the magic of the Lord's illusory potency. The conditioned soulmust come to understand, "I am a pure spirit soul, part and parcel of Kåñëa.Now let me stop my useless activities and serve Kåñëa, since I am part of Him."Then he is free from the illusion of mäyä. If one artificially tries to escape theclutches of the illusory energy by declaring that there is no illusory potencyand that this world is false, he merely falls into another illusion created bymäyä to keep him in ignorance. Kåñëa states in Bhagavad-gétä (7.14),</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">daivé hy eñä guëamayé</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mama mäyä duratyayä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mäm eva ye prapadyante</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mäyäm etäà taranti te</div>
<div class="First">Unless one surrenders at the lotus feet of Mäyeça, the Lord of the illusorypotency, there is no possibility of escaping from illusion. Childishly declaringthat there is no illusory potency is useless, since mäyä is duratyayä, orinsurpassable for the tiny living entity. But Lord Kåñëa, the omnipotentPersonality of Godhead, can immediately call off the illusory potency.In this verse the expansion of the material world from Brahman, theAbsolute, is described. Since Brahman is one of the subordinate features of theSupreme Personality of Godhead (brahmeti paramätmeti bhagavän iti çabdyate[SB 1.2.11]), one who understands this material world to be Brahman is freedfrom the tendency to exploit the material energy through sense gratificationand mental speculation aimed at one's own satisfaction.The question may be raised, Since Brahman is stated to be ekam, or one,how does it become manifest in the innumerable varieties of the materialworld? Therefore this verse uses the word uru-çakti. The Absolute containsmultipotencies, as stated in the Vedas (Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad): parasya çaktirvividhaiva çrüyate [Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]. The Absolute Truth is not çakti,or energy, but çaktimän, the possessor of innumerable potencies. According toÇréla Çrédhara Svämé, one should submissively hear these authorizeddescriptions of the Absolute Truth. As stated in the previous verse,yathänalam arciñaù sväù: the insignificant sparks of a fire have no power toilluminate the blazing fire, which is itself the source of illumination. Similarly,the tiny living entity, who is like a spark of the Supreme Personality ofGodhead, cannot illuminate the Personality of Godhead by his insignificantintellectual power. One may argue that the sun expands its potency in theform of its rays and it is through the illumination of those rays that we are ableto see the sun. In the same way, we should be able to perceive the AbsoluteTruth by the expansion of its potency. In answer to this it may be stated that ifthe sun creates a cloud covering the sky, then despite the presence of sun raysthe sun cannot be seen. Therefore, ultimately the power to see the sundepends not only on the sun's rays but on the presence of a clear sky, which isalso an arrangement by the sun. Similarly, as stated in this verse, one canunderstand the existence of the Absolute Truth by the expansion of its potencies.</div>
<div class="First">Although in the previous verse the power of the material senses and mindwas rejected, the authorized descriptions given here inform us that one candirectly perceive everything that exists to be the potency of the Personality ofGodhead. In this regard, Närada Muni advised King Präcénabarhi as follows:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">atas tad apavädärthaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhaja sarvätmanä harim</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">paçyaàs tad-ätmakaà viçvaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sthity-utpatty-apyayä yataù</div>
<div class="First">"You should always know that this cosmic manifestation is created, maintainedand annihilated by the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Consequently, everything within this cosmic manifestation is under thecontrol of the Lord. To be enlightened by this perfect knowledge, one shouldalways engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord." (SB 4.29.79) Asstated here, bhaja sarvätmanä harim: one must worship the SupremePersonality of Godhead so that one's consciousness will become clean andpure, just like the clear blue sky in which the potent sun is fully manifest.When one sees the sun, he immediately sees the sun's rays in full potency.Similarly, if one engages in the devotional service of Kåñëa, one's mindbecomes cleansed of material dirt, and thus he can see not only the Lord butthe Lord's expansions as the spiritual world, as the pure devotees, as theParamätmä, as the impersonal Brahman effulgence and as the subsequentcreation of the material world, the shadow of the kingdom of God (chäyeva), in which so many material varieties become manifest.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the word phalam can also be understood tomean puruñärtha-svarüpam, or the actual form of the goal of life, or, in otherwords, the transcendental form of the Lord Himself. The living entity in hisoriginal pure state is not different from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Similarly, the infinite multicolored opulence of the kingdom of God, calledVaikuëöha, is nondifferent in quality from the Lord. Thus when the SupremePersonality of Godhead is personally present with His unparalleled opulenceand His pure spiritual servitors, the living entities, a very happy situation iscreated. The mundane concept of family is a perverted reflection of the happysituation created when the Lord is united in full spiritual opulence with Hispure devotees. Every living entity has the option to join the Lord in Hisopulent eternal kingdom. Thus one should understand from this verse thateverything within the gross and subtle cosmic manifestations is the potency ofthe Lord and is therefore meant to be used in the Lord's service. Éçäväsyam idaà sarvam [Éço mantra 1].</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has given an elaborate explanation proving that theentire cosmic situation is the natural potency of the Absolute Truth.Sometimes superstitious people, without knowledge of the Personality ofGodhead, say that material activities are controlled by an independent deviland that God is struggling with such a devil. Such gross ignorance of theomnipotent status of the Personality of Godhead can be removed byunderstanding the purport of this verse. Just as a spark is a tiny emanationfrom a blazing fire, everything that exists is but an insignificant spark of thepotency of the Personality of Godhead. The Lord therefore says in</div>

<div class="First">"But what need is there, Arjuna, for all this detailed knowledge? With a singlefragment of Myself I pervade and support this entire universe." Theomnipotent Personality of Godhead is actually the well-wishing friend of everyliving entity (suhådaà sarva-bhütänäm [Bg. 5.29]). Therefore, if one becomessane and understands that one's well-wishing friend Kåñëa is the ultimatesource and controller of everything that exists, one attains immediate peace(jïätvä mäà çäntim åcchati). Fear and illusion arise when one foolishly thinksthat even one atom of the creation is not the controlled potency of thePersonality of Godhead. Bhayaà dvitéyäbhiniveçataù syät. Denying theexistence of the material world also creates a very dangerous situation ofillusion. Both types of atheism—namely, seeing the material world asbelonging to oneself (and therefore being meant for one's sense gratification)and declaring the nonexistence of the material world—are futile attempts toavoid one's eternal subordination to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whois the actual owner and enjoyer of everything. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has quotedthe following question stated by Çré Maitreya to Çré Paräçara in the Viñëu Puräëa (1.3.1):</div>

<div class="First">"Mere logic cannot explain how even material objects expand their potency.These things can be understood by mature observation. The Absolute Truthexpands His potency in the creation, maintenance and annihilation of thematerial world just as fire expands its potency of heat." (Viñëu Puräëa 1.3.2)Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains that one can understand the power of a valuablegem not by logical statements but by observing the effect of the gem. Similarly,one can understand the potency of a mantra by observing its power to achievea particular effect. Such potency doesn't depend on so-called logic. There is nological necessity for a seed's growing into a tree and giving fruits that nourishthe human body. One may argue that the genetic code for the entire tree iscontained within the seed. But there is no logical necessity for the existence ofthe seed, nor for the seed's expanding itself into a gigantic tree. Ex post facto,or after the manifestation of the wonderful material nature, the foolishmaterial scientist traces out the expansion of a seed's potency in an apparentlylogical sequence of events. But there is nothing within the realm of so-calledpure logic that dictates that a seed should expand into a tree. Rather, suchexpansion should be understood to be the potency of the tree. Similarly, thepotency of a jewel is its mystic power, and various mantras also contain innatepotencies. Ultimately the mahä-mantra—Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, KåñëaKåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare—has thepotency to transfer one to the spiritual world of bliss and knowledge. In thesame way, the Absolute Truth has the natural quality of expanding itself intoinnumerable varieties of material and spiritual worlds. We may logicallydescribe this expansion after the fact, but we cannot deny the expansion of theAbsolute Truth. The conditioned soul who purifies his consciousness throughthe process of devotional service can scientifically observe the expansion ofthe Absolute Truth as described here, just as one who is not blind can observethe expansion of a seed into a huge tee. One can understand the potency of aseed not by speculation but rather by practical observation. Similarly, one mustpurify his vision so that he can practically observe the expansion of theAbsolute Truth. Such observation can take place either by the ears or by theeyes. Vedic knowledge is çabda-brahma, or transcendental potency in the formof sound vibration. Therefore, one can observe the functions of the AbsoluteTruth through submissive hearing of transcendental sound. Çästra-cakñus.When one's consciousness becomes fully purified one can perceive theAbsolute Truth with all of one's spiritualized senses.The Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, is devoid of materialqualities such as mundane goodness, passion and ignorance because He is anocean of transcendental qualities and therefore has no need for the inferiorqualities of the material world. As stated in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad (4.10),mäyäà tu prakåtià vidyän mäyinaà tu maheçvaram: "Understand that mäyä isthe material energy whereas the Supreme Lord is the Supreme Lord ofmäyä."Similarly, it is stated in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, mäyäà catad-apäçrayäm: mäyä is always under the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="First">Just as it is understood from the above discussion that the material world isan emanation from the impersonal Brahman potency of the Lord, Brahmanitself is an expansion of the potency of Kåñëa, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä (brahmaëo hi pratiñöhäham).</div>

<div class="Translation"> Brahman, the eternal soul, was never born and will never die, nor does it grow or decay. That spiritual soul is actually the knower of the youth, middle age and death of the material body. Thus the soul can be understood to be pure consciousness, existing everywhere at all times and never being destroyed. Just as the life air within the body, although one, becomes manifest as many in contact with the various material senses, the one soul appears to assume various material designations in contact with the material body.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Vedic aphorism sarvaà khalv idaà brahma, "Everything is Brahman,"has been explained in this chapter of the Bhägavatam. The SupremePersonality of Godhead is the original source of everything. By expanding Hisinternal potency, He manifests the spiritual world, and by expanding Hisexternal potency He manifests the material cosmos. The conditioned livingentity is originally part and parcel of the superior, internal potency of theLord, but being in contact with illusion, he falls under the clutches of theexternal potency. In any case, since everything is an expansion of the potencyof the Supreme Brahman, everything is part and parcel of the Lord's spiritualpotency. Bhayaà dvitéyäbhiniveçataù syäd éçäd apetasya viparyayo 'småtiù. Whena living entity thinks that the material world is not part and parcel of theLord's potency but is a separate existence, liable to be controlled and enjoyedby the tiny jéva soul, he is under viparyayaù, or a wrong conception. Asmåtiù.Thus the living entity forgets that the Supreme Lord is the proprietor ofeverything, everything being an expansion of the Lord.Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has pointed out that although the Lord's externalpotency is subject to transformations such as birth, growth, decay and death,one should not foolishly conclude that the Lord's internal potency, the livingentity, is also subject to these changes. Both the living entity and materialnature are ultimately Brahman, being expansions of the Supreme Brahman.But the Vedas clearly say, paräsya çaktir vividhaiva çrüyate: [Cc. Madhya 13.65,purport] the Lord's potencies are vividhä, or multifarious. Thus, according tothis verse, nätmä jajäna na mariñyati naidhate 'sau na kñéyate: the soul is neverborn, nor does he die, and he certainly cannot grow or decay like a materialbody. Although the visible material body passes through boyhood, adolescenceand old age, or although one may take birth as a demigod, human being, plantor animal, the spirit soul never changes his eternal constitutional position.Rather, he falsely identifies with the external transformations of the materialbody and thus imposes upon himself a psychological condition called illusion.This miserable illusory experience of seeing oneself transformed andultimately annihilated by the laws of nature can be nullified by transcendentalknowledge of one's eternal status as the superior energy of the Lord.The word sarvatra in this verse should not be foolishly misinterpreted tomean that the individual jéva soul is all-pervading. The soul is not born, nordoes he die. Yet in our present conditioned state we falsely identify with thebirth and death of the body. Therefore, because an all-pervading soul wouldnever fall into illusion, sarvatra cannot indicate that the individual soul isall-pervading. Illusion implies an incomplete understanding of reality, whichwould not be possible for an all-pervading entity. Therefore, the word sarvatrais understood to mean that the pure spiritual soul exists in all materialconditions. In deep sleep, for example, consciousness may not overtly bemanifest, and yet the spirit soul is understood to be present within the body.Similarly, it is understood from Bhagavad-gétä that the spirit soul (nityaùsarva-gataù) may exist even within fire, water or outer space, since theexistence of the soul never depends upon material conditions but is an eternalfact. The consciousness of the soul is more or less manifest according to thepossibilities offered by a particular material situation, just as electric light ismanifest in a particular intensity and color according to the bulb available.The electrical energy is one, but it is manifested variously according to material conditions.</div>
<div class="First">The argument may be raised that although the spirit soul is pureconsciousness (upalabdhi-mätram), it is our practical experience thatconsciousness is constantly transformed. If I am thinking of a blue object suchas the sky, then my previous thought of a yellow object such as a flower isdestroyed. Similarly, if I become aware that I am hungry, then myconsciousness of the blue sky is destroyed. In this way, consciousness isconstantly being transformed. Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has replied thatconsciousness itself is eternal, but in contact with the material senses it may bemanifest in various ways. The example of the life air is very appropriate. Präëa,or the life air, is one, but in contact with the different senses it is manifest asthe power to see, the power to hear, and so on. Similarly, consciousness, beingspiritual, is ultimately one, but when in contact with the various senses it maybe perceived in terms of particular sensory functions. But the state ofconsciousness is an eternal fact that cannot be changed, although it may be temporarily covered by mäyä.</div>
<div class="First">When one becomes Kåñëa conscious, he is understood to be dhéra (dhérastatra na muhyati [Bg. 2.13]). At that time one is no longer subject tobewilderment by falsely identifying his consciousness with the transformations of material nature.</div>
<div class="First">From the statement tat tvam asi, found in the Chändogya Upaniñad, it is tobe understood that spiritual knowledge is not impersonal but entails graduallyperceiving the pure spiritual soul within the material body. Just as inBhagavad-gétä Kåñëa repeatedly says aham, or "I," this Vedic aphorism uses theword tvam, or "you," to indicate that just as the Absolute Truth is the SupremePersonality of Godhead, the individual spark of Brahman (tat) is also aneternal personality (tvam). Therefore, according to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé it is tobe understood that the individual spark of Brahman is eternally conscious.Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has further pointed out that instead ofwasting time trying to understand the truth in its impersonal aspect, which ismerely the negation of temporary material variety, one should try tounderstand oneself to be an eternally conscious entity in the jéva category. Inother words, one should understand oneself to be eternally a conscious servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="First">In this regard Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted the following statement from the Mokña-dharma section of the Mahäbhärata:</div>

<div class="Translation"> The spirit soul is born in many different species of life within the material world. Some species are born from eggs, others from embryos, others from the seeds of plants and trees, and others from perspiration. But in all species of life the präëa, or vital air, remains unchanging and follows the spirit soul from one body to another. Similarly, the spirit soul is eternally the same despite its material condition of life. We have practical experience of this. When we are absorbed in deep sleep without dreaming, the material senses become inactive, and even the mind and false ego are merged into a dormant condition. But although the senses, mind and false ego are inactive, one remembers upon waking that he, the soul, was peacefully sleeping.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">When a living entity is awake the material senses and mind are constantlyactive. Similarly, when one is sleeping the false ego recollects one's wakingexperiences, and thus one experiences dreams or fragments of dreams whilesleeping. But in the state of prasupti, or deep sleep, both the mind and thesenses become inactive, and the false ego does not recall previous experiencesor desires. The subtle mind and false ego are called liìga-çaréra, or the subtlematerial body. This linga-çaréra is experienced in the form of temporarymaterial designations such as "I am a rich man," "I am a strong man," "I amblack," "I am white," "I am American," "I am Chinese." The sum total of one'sillusory conceptions of oneself is called ahaìkära, or false ego. And due to thisillusory conception of life the living entity transmigrates from one species oflife to another, as clearly explained in Bhagavad-gétä. The spirit soul, however,does not change its constitutional position of eternity, knowledge and bliss,although the soul may temporarily forget this position. To cite an analogoussituation, if one dreams at night that he is walking in the forest, such a dreamdoes not change one's actual position of lying in bed within his apartment.Thus it is stated in this verse, küöa-stha äçayam åte: despite the transformationsof the subtle body, the spirit soul does not change. Çréla Çrédhara Svämé hasgiven the following example to illustrate this point. Etävantaà kälaà sukhamaham asväpsam, na kiïcid avediñam. One often thinks, "I was sleeping verypeacefully, although I was not dreaming or aware of anything." It can belogically understood that one cannot remember something of which he has hadno experience. Therefore, since one remembers peacefully sleeping althoughthere was no mental or sensual experience, such a memory should beunderstood to be a vague experience of the spirit soul.Çréla Madhväcärya has explained that the demigods, who are a superior raceof humanlike entities on the higher planetary systems of this universe, do notactually undergo the gross ignorance of deep sleep as do ordinary humanbeings. Because the demigods have superior intelligence, they are not mergedinto ignorance at the time of sleeping. In Bhagavad-gétä Lord Kåñëa says,mattaù småtir jïänam apohanaà ca [Bg. 15.15]. Sleep is apohanam, orforgetfulness. Sometimes by dreaming there is småti, or memory of one's actualcondition, although in a dream one may experience one's family or friends inan altered, illusory state. But all such conditions of remembering andforgetting are due to the presence of the Supersoul within the heart. By themercy of the Supersoul one can have a preliminary glimpse of the soul byremembering how one was peacefully resting even without mental or sensual experience.</div>
<div class="First">According to the authorized commentaries on this verse, aviniçciteñu meanssveda-jeñu, or born from perspiration. Çréla Madhväcärya has pointed out,bhü-svedena hi präyo jäyante: the earth's dew is to be considered theperspiration of the earth, and various species of life are generated from dew.In the Muëòaka Upaniñad (3.1.9) the situation of the soul in relation to präëa is explained:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">eño 'ëur ätmä cetasä veditavyo</div>

The soul is situated within the heart, and it spreads its influence allover the body of the embodied living entities. When the soul is purified fromthe contamination of the five kinds of material air, its spiritual influence isexhibited." Thus in the innumerable species of life the spiritual soul remains situated within präëa, or the material life air.</div>

When the heart is thus purified one can directly perceive both the Supreme Lord and one's self as transcendental entities. Thus one becomes perfect in spiritual understanding through direct experience, just as one can directly experience the sunshine through normal, healthy vision.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the previous verse it was explained that one can have a preliminaryglimpse of the eternal, unchanging soul by remembering one's experience ofpeacefully sleeping even while the mind and senses were totally inactive. Onemay ask, If in deep sleep there is a preliminary experience of the soul, whyupon waking does one return to illusory material existence? It may beanswered that because of material desires lodged within the heart theconditioned soul is addicted to the nescience of material sense gratification. Aprisoner may glimpse through the bars the free light outside the prison windowbut still remain captive behind the bars. Similarly, although a conditioned soulmay have a glimpse of the spirit soul, he remains captured within the bondageof material desires. Therefore, although one may have a preliminaryunderstanding of the eternal soul that exists within the temporary body, oreven of the Supersoul that accompanies the individual soul within the heart, aspecific process is still required to eliminate the cause of material existence, namely material desire.</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">As explained in Bhagavad-gétä (8.6),</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yaà yaà väpi smaran bhävaà</div>

<div class="First">"Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state hewill attain without fail." According to one's desire at the time of death asuitable material body is awarded by material nature. Karmaëä daiva-netreëajantur dehopapattaye [SB 3.31.1]. According to one's fruitive desires and actionsand under the jurisdiction of the representatives of the Lord called demigods,the living entity is awarded a particular material body, which is inevitablysubject to harassment by birth, death, old age and disease. If one can eliminatethe cause of a particular phenomenon, logically he also eliminates the effect.Therefore, this verse states that one should desire only to achieve shelter atthe lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead. One should give up illusorydesires for material society, friendship and love, since such desires causefurther material bondage. One should fix his mind on the Supreme Personalityof Godhead, Kåñëa, so that without fail one can remember Kåñëa at the time of</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">death. As the Lord states,</div>

Andthe Lord can be directly perceived as soon as one's heart has become transparently clean through bhakti-yoga.</div>
<div class="First">Bhagavad-gétä describes the state of achieving the Supreme Personality ofGodhead by the words tato mäà tattvato jïätvä viçate tad-anantaram, andsometimes impersonalists falsely interpret these words to be a description ofbrahma-säyujyam, or impersonal merging into the existence of the Lord. It isclearly mentioned in this verse that one must fix his mind and devotion on thelotus feet of abja-näbha, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If theindividual living entity were equal to the Personality of Godhead, the livingentity could simply think of himself in order to be purified. But even then acontradiction would arise: the Personality of Godhead has no need to bepurified, since He is described in Bhagavad-gétä as pavitraà paramam, or thesupreme pure. Therefore, one should not artificially try to twist an impersonalmeaning out of the statements of the Vedic literature.Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has stated that the perfect stage ofdevotional service indicated in this verse can be observed in the activities ofsuch great devotees as Dhruva Mahäräja. Dhruva Mahäräja approached thePersonality of Godhead desiring a political adjustment on the materialplatform, but when purified by chanting the holy name of God (oà namobhagavate väsudeväya) he felt no further need for material sense gratification.As stated in the First Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, janayaty äçu vairägyam. Assoon as one advances in devotional service, one is freed from the embarrassment of superficial material desires.</div>
<div class="First">The words upalabhyata ätma-tattvam are significant in this verse.Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura says that ätma-tattvam, or knowledge of thesoul, indicates knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead along withHis various expansions such as the impersonal brahmajyoti and the marginalliving entity himself. As indicated here by the word säkñät, perceiving thePersonality of Godhead means seeing the personal form of the Lord, His handsand legs, His various transcendental vehicles and servants, and so on, just as bydevotion to the sun-god one can gradually perceive the personal body of thesun-god, along with his chariot and personal attendants.Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has pointed out that in verses 35through 39 the various stages of standard logic are demonstrated. Verse 35establishes the viñaya, or general thesis. Verse 36 manifests saàçaya, or anexpression of doubt. Verse 37 gives the pürva-pakña, or opposing argument.And verse 38 definitely establishes the siddhänta, or conclusion. Verse 39presents saìgati, the summary. The saìgati, or final word, is that one shouldbecome a pure devotee of the Personality of Godhead and worship the Lord'slotus feet. Thus by cleansing the mirror of the heart one can see the Lord, justas a normal human being with healthy 20/20 vision can very easily see thebrilliant rays of the sun or as an advanced devotee of the sun-god himself can see the personal body of the sun-god.</div>

But if the soul is engaged in hisnatural function of Kåñëa consciousness, whatever he is able to do is good for him."</div>
<div class="First">Ordinary people often question the busy activities of the devotees of theKåñëa consciousness movement, mistaking such activities to be ordinarymaterial work. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has stated in this connection,kämya-karmäëy eva tyäjitäni, na tu nitya-naimittikäni, phalasyaiva vininditatvät.One should give up selfish activities performed for one's personal sensegratification, since the result of such thoughtless work is further materialbondage. But one should offer one's regular or occasional occupational dutiesto the Supreme Lord, and thus such activities become transcendentaldevotional service. By the words tasmäd guruà prapadyeta jijïäsuù çreyauttamam [SB 11.3.21], this chapter has clearly explained that dovetailing one'swork with the service of the Lord is an art one should learn at the lotus feet ofthe bona fide spiritual master. Otherwise, if one whimsically declares hismaterialistic work to be transcendental devotional service, there will be noactual result. Therefore, according to Çré Jéva Gosvämé, one should not mistakethe word naiñkarmyam to indicate inactivity; rather, it indicatestranscendental activity under the guidance of the Lord and His representative.</div>

This difficult subject matter can never be understood by mundane speculation. The authorized Vedic literature is the sound incarnation of the Personality of Godhead Himself, and thus Vedic knowledge is perfect. Even the greatest learned scholars are bewildered in their attempts to understand the science of action if they neglect the authority of Vedic knowledge.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Prescribed duties authorized by revealed scripture are called karma, whereasthe failure to execute one's highest duty is called akarma. The performance offorbidden activities is called vikarma. Thus karma, akarma and vikarma areestablished by the authorized explanations of Vedic literature. They cannot beascertained merely through mundane exercises in logic. In theÇrémad-Bhägavatam (6.16.51) the Lord says, çabda-brahma paraà brahmamamobhe çäçvaté tanü: "I am the form of the transcendental vibrations of theVedas, such as oàkära and Hare Kåñëa Hare Räma, and I am the SupremeAbsolute Truth. These two forms of Mine—namely, the transcendental Vedicsound and the eternally blissful spiritual form of the Deity—are My eternalforms; they are not material. " Similarly, it is stated in the Bhägavatam (6.1.40),vedo näräyaëaù säkñät svayambhür iti çuçruma: "The Vedas are directly theSupreme Personality of Godhead, Näräyaëa, and are self-born. This we haveheard from Yamaräja." In the Puruña-sükta (Åg Veda, maëòala 10, sükta 90,mantra 9) it is stated, tasmäd yajïät sarva-huta åcaù sämäni jajïjire/ chandäàsijajïjire tasmät: "From Him, Yajïa, came all sacrificial offerings, hymns ofinvocation and songs of praise. All the mantras of the Vedas come from theLord." All the incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead arecompletely transcendental and free from the four defects of conditional life,namely mistakes, illusion, cheating and imperfect senses. So Vedic knowledge,being a plenary manifestation of the Supreme Lord, is similarly infallible and transcendental.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has pointed out that in thematerial world, which is controlled by the illusory energy of the Lord, aparticular sound vibration is discarded after describing its object. But on thespiritual platform called Vaikuëöha nothing is ever lost, and thusçabda-brahma, or the Personality of Godhead in His form as transcendental sound, is eternal.</div>
<div class="First">In ordinary human discourse one can ascertain the meaning of humanwords by understanding the intention of the speaker. But since Vedicknowledge is apauruñeya, or transcendental, one can appreciate its purportonly by hearing from the standard authorities in the chain of disciplicsuccession. This process is prescribed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gétä(evaà paramparä-präptam [Bg. 4.2]). Thus, even highly learned scholars whoproudly neglect this simple descending process are certainly bewildered andembarrassed in their hopeless attempt to ascertain the ultimate meaning ofVedic knowledge. The four sons of Lord Brahmä declined to answer thequestion of King Nimi since at that time the King was a mere child andtherefore not capable of seriously surrendering to the process of hearingthrough disciplic succession. Çréla Madhväcärya has pointed out in this regard,éçvarätmatväd éçvara-viñayatvät. Because the Vedas describe the unlimitedPersonality of Godhead, Vedic knowledge cannot be approached by mundane methods of comprehension.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Childish and foolish people are attached to materialistic, fruitive activities, although the actual goal of life is to become free from such activities. Therefore, the Vedic injunctions indirectly lead one to the path of ultimate liberation by first prescribing fruitive religious activities, just as a father promises his child candy so that the child will take his medicine.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, traiguëya-viñayä vedä nistraiguëyo bhavärjuna.The Vedas apparently offer fruitive results within the three modes of materialnature. Those who perform ritualistic ceremonies or austerities in the mode ofgoodness are offered the chance for promotion to the higher planetary systemscalled Svargaloka. Açnanti divyän divi deva-bhogän. Similarly, those whoperform karma-käëòa, or fruitive religious activities in the mode of passion,are allowed to become great rulers or wealthy men on earth and enjoy greatprestige and earthly power. But as stated in the Manu-saàhitä, pravåttir eñäbhütänäà nivåttis tu mahä-phalä: "Although fruitive religious activities arevery much popular among the conditioned souls, the actual perfection of life is achieved when one gives up all fruitive endeavor."</div>
<div class="First">If a father tells his child, "You must take this medicine by my order," thechild may become fearful and rebellious and reject the medicine. Therefore,the father entices his child by saying, "I am going to give you a delicious pieceof candy. But if you want this candy, first just take this little bit of medicine,and then you can have the candy." Such indirect persuasion is calledparokña-vädaù, or an indirect description that conceals the actual purpose. Thefather presents his proposal to the child as if the ultimate goal were to receivethe candy and only a minor condition must be fulfilled to receive it. Actually,however, the father's goal is to administer the medicine to the child and curehim of his disease. Thus, describing the primary purpose indirectly andconcealing it with a secondary proposal is called parokña-vädaù, or indirect persuasion.</div>
<div class="First">Since the great majority of conditioned souls are addicted to sensegratification (pravåttir eñä bhütänäm), the Vedic karma-käëòa rituals offerthem a chance to become free from temporary materialistic sense gratificationby making them greedy for fruitive Vedic results such as promotion to heavenor a powerful ruling position on earth. In all Vedic rituals Viñëu is worshiped,and thus one is gradually promoted to the understanding that one's actualself-interest is to surrender to Viñëu. Na te viduù svärtha-gatià hi viñëum [SB7.5.31]. Such an indirect method is prescribed for bälänäm, those who arechildish or foolish. An intelligent person can immediately understand bydirect analysis the actual purpose of Vedic literature as described by the LordHimself (vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù [Bg. 15.15]). All Vedic knowledgeultimately aims at achieving shelter at the lotus feet of the SupremePersonality of Godhead. Without such shelter one must rotate within the8,400,000 species offered by the illusory energy of the Lord. Ordinary materialvision, either through gross sense perception or the subtle perception ofrational induction, always yields imperfect knowledge distorted by the desirefor illusory material enjoyment. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkuracomments that the cultivation of impersonal self-realization is also adisturbance to the conditioned souls, since the impersonal speculative processis an artificial attempt to become completely formless. Such an attempt is notat all in accord with the proper judgment of the Vedas, which is described inBhagavad-gétä (vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù [Bg. 15.15]).In Lord Caitanya's movement there is no need to childishly pursue fruitivematerial results and gradually be dragged to actual knowledge. According to Caitanya Mahäprabhu:</div>

Thustheir minds are never peaceful (upadrutäù), and their very brief life spanvitiates the possibility of their gradually progressing through the path of Vedicritualistic activities. Therefore, the only hope is to chant the holy names of theLord, harer näma [Cc. Ädi 17.21], In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (12.3.51) it is stated:</div>

In Kali-yuga all naturalelements are polluted, such as water, earth, sky, mind, intelligence and ego.The only auspicious aspect of this fallen age is the process of chanting the holynames of the Lord (asti hy eko mahän guëaù). Simply by the delightful processof kåñëa-kértana one is freed from his connection to this fallen age(mukta-saìga) and goes back home, back to Godhead (paraà vrajet).Sometimes the preachers of the Kåñëa consciousness movement also use theparokña, or indirect method of persuasion, offering a nice transcendental sweetto the conditioned soul to entice him to come to the lotus feet of the Lord.Caitanya Mahäprabhu's movement is kevala änanda-käëòa, simply blissful. Butby the mercy of Caitanya Mahäprabhu even one who is indirectly attracted tothe Kåñëa consciousness movement achieves very quickly the perfection of life and goes back home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the previous verse it was stated that although fruitive activities areprescribed in the Vedas, the actual goal of human life is to free oneself from allmaterialistic activities. Therefore, one may conclude that there is no need toperform the Vedic rituals, which offer regulated sense gratification. But anignorant person, or, in other words, one who has not understood that he is notthe material body but an eternal spiritual soul, part and parcel of Kåñëa, willinvariably be unable to control the urges of the material senses. Therefore, ifsuch a materially inclined person neglects the Vedic injunctions thatadminister regulated sense gratification, he will surely fall down intounregulated sense gratification in päpa, or sinful life. For example, those whoare affected by sexual desire are ordered to accept the viväha-yajïa, or religiousmarriage ceremony. We often see that because of false pride a so-calledbrahmacäré, or celibate student of Vedic knowledge, rejects the marriageceremony as mäyä, or material illusion. But if such a celibate student is unableto control his senses he will undoubtedly degrade himself by eventuallyengaging in illicit sex, which has no connection to Vedic culture. Similarly, aneophyte in Kåñëa consciousness is encouraged to eat kåñëa-prasädam to hisfull satisfaction. Sometimes an immature practitioner of bhakti-yoga tries tomake a show of severe eating habits and eventually falls down into eating unregulated and abominable foodstuffs.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the words måtyormåtyum upaiti mean that a sinful person is awarded a free ticket to hell by thelord of death himself, Yamaräja. This is also described in the Vedas as follows:måtvä punar måtyum äpadyate ardyamänaù sva-karmabhiù. "Persons who causethemselves severe pain by their materialistic activities gain no relief at themoment of death, for they are placed again in a situation in which death willoccur." Therefore, Vedic ritualistic activities such as the wedding ceremony orthe relishing of sumptuous yajïa-çiñöa, or food remnants of sacrifice, should notbe given up by those whose senses are not yet controlled.The previous verse gave the example of a father's administering candy tohis son to induce the child to take medicine. If the child rejects the father'soffer, thinking that the candy is unnecessary, the child also misses theopportunity to take the medicine that will cure him. Similarly, if amaterialistic person rejects the Vedic injunctions that administer prescribedsense gratification, he will not be purified but instead will be further degraded.Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has described a materialistic person as one whose mind andintelligence are not faithfully fixed in the message of the Supreme Personalityof Godhead. In Bhagavad-gétä Çré Bhagavän, Lord Kåñëa, gives wonderfulexplanations to the conditioned souls, represented by Arjuna, concerning theactual goal of life. One who cannot fix his mind on these instructions is to beconsidered a materialistic person who is inclined toward sinful activities andwho must therefore submit himself to the standard Vedic injunctions. SuchVedic injunctions, even though fruitive. are considered puëya, or pious,according to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, and thus one who strictly performs them willnot go to hell. Lord Kåñëa Himself states in the Bhägavatam (11.20.9),</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tävat karmäëi kurvéta</div>

<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains that the Vedas prescribe thatone rise early in the morning, bathe, and chant the Gäyatré mantra. If oneartificially gives up such a disciplined, regulated life, one will gradually becomea victim of activities for gross sense gratification, such as eating in restaurantsand indulging in illicit connections with women. Thus losing control of hissenses, he becomes just like an animal, engaging from the early morning untilthe night in dangerous activities. Çréla Madhväcärya has commented in thisregard, ajïaù sann äcarann api. Although in ignorance, one continues to act,not considering the future result of one's activities. Such indifference to thefuture result of one's activities is described in Bhagavad-gétä to be a symptom ofthe mode of ignorance. Just as an intelligent man will not drive his car on ahighway if he knows the highway will lead him to danger, an intelligent manwill not perform non-Vedic activities if he knows that the ultimate result willbe the disaster described here by the words måtyor måtyum upaiti. ÇrélaBhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has stated that ignorant persons sometimesthink that after death one automatically attains everlasting peace. But by thepowerful reactions of one's sinful activities one comes to a most unpeacefulcondition, for one must suffer hellish miseries in exchange for the meagertemporary fruits of material work. Such hellish reactions occur not once butperpetually, as long as one is indifferent to the Vedic injunctions.</div>

<div class="First">Human life is an opportunity offered by the laws of nature to theconditioned soul so that he may understand his eternal relationship with theSupreme Personality of Godhead.

<div class="First">"Those persons who are materially engrossed, being blind to the knowledge ofultimate truth, have many subject matters for hearing in human society, O Emperor." (SB 2.1.2)</div>
<div class="First">It is stated, parama-käruëiko vedaù—"Vedic knowledge is supremelymerciful"—because it engages the animalistic human beings in a gradualprocess of purification that culminates in full consciousness of Lord Kåñëa, theSupreme Personality of Godhead. This is confirmed by the Lord Himself inBhagavad-gétä (vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù [Bg. 15.15]). The majority ofhuman beings are not able to suddenly give up material sense gratification,even though they understand from Vedic literature that such sensegratification causes a pernicious future effect. We have practical experience inthe Western countries that when the government informed the citizens thatsmoking cigarettes causes lung cancer, most people were unable to give uptheir smoking habit. Therefore, the Vedic literature prescribes a gradualprocess of purification in which the conditioned soul learns to offer the resultsof his material activities to the Supreme Lord, thus spiritualizing thoseactivities. Material sense gratification is based on two organs, namely thetongue for tasting and the genitals for sex life. By offering palatable food to theDeity of Kåñëa and then enjoying the remnants as kåñëa-prasädam and byaccepting the rules and regulations for Vedic householder life and begetting ofKåñëa conscious children, one can gradually bring the full range of materialactivities to the platform of pure devotional service. By offering the fruits ofone's ordinary activities to the Supreme Lord, one gradually understands thatthe Lord Himself, and not material sense gratification, is the actual goal of life.Lord Kåñëa warns in Bhagavad-gétä that if people are prematurely encouragedto give up householder life or the sumptuous remnants of the Lord's prasädam,such artificial renunciation will have the opposite effect.There is a class of duplicitous men who misunderstand the transcendentalpurpose of the Vedas and falsely claim that material fruitive results such aspromotion to heaven, which is offered in the agniñöoma sacrifice, constitutethe ultimate goal of the Vedas. Such foolish men have been described by Lord Kåñëa:</div>

<div class="First">"Men of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of theVedas, which recommend various fruitive activities for elevation to heavenlyplanets, resultant good birth, power, and so forth. Being desirous of sensegratification and opulent life, they say that there is nothing more than this."(Bg. 2.42-43) To refute such a foolish understanding of the Vedic purpose, thisverse uses the word niùsaìgaù, which means "without attachment to materialresults." The actual purpose of the Vedas is arpitam éçvare, to offer everythingto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The result is siddhim, or the perfection of life, Kåñëa consciousness.</div>
<div class="First">The words rocanärthä phala-çrutiù clearly indicate that the fruitive resultspromised in the Vedic literature are meant to stimulate a materialistic personto have faith in the Vedic injunctions. The example is given that a child maybe offered candy-covered medicine. The child becomes enthusiastic to take themedicine because of the candy coating, whereas a mature person will beenthusiastic to take the medicine itself, knowing that such medicine is meantfor his real self-interest. The mature platform of Vedic understanding ismentioned in the Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad (4.4.22): tam etaà vedänuvacanenabrähmaëä vividiñanti brahmacaryeëa tapasä çraddhayä yajïenänäçakena ca. "Bythe teaching of the Vedas and by celibacy, penances, faith and controlledeating, great brähmaëas come to know the Supreme." The Supreme is Kåñëa, asstated in Bhagavad-gétä. Although the prescribed rituals of the Vedas maysometimes resemble material fruitive work, the activity is spiritualized becausethe result is offered to the Supreme. Candy-covered medicine and ordinarycandy may appear or taste the same. But the candy-covered medicine has atherapeutic effect not found in ordinary candy. Similarly, the wordsnaiñkarmyaà labhate siddhim in this verse indicate that a faithful follower ofthe Vedic injunctions will gradually be promoted to the highest perfection oflife, pure love of Godhead, as stated by Caitanya Mahäprabhu (premä pum-artho mahän).</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Vedic literatures contain mysterious descriptions of the AbsoluteTruth that stimulate philosophical speculation. The Vedas also offer heavenlyrewards for the performance of ritualistic ceremonies. But as stated in verse 44of this chapter such jïäna-käëòa and karma-käëòa sections of the Vedas arebälänäm anuçäsanam; that is, because less intelligent or childish persons areaddicted to mental speculation and fruitive activity, these sections of theVedas are meant to attract such persons to take shelter of the Vedicinjunctions for gradual promotion to the perfect stage of Kåñëa consciousness.Now that the path for those who are materialistic has been described inseveral verses, this verse describes the process for those who are vijïaù, orlearned transcendentalists. Such learned transcendentalists are advised tofollow the regulated worship described in such Vaiñëava tantras as ÇréNärada-païcarätra for pleasing the Supreme Lord directly. The wordsupacared devaà tantroktena ca keçavam indicate that one should directlyworship Keçava, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who appears in manydifferent incarnations to please His devotees. Çréla Jayadeva Gosvämé hasdescribed the pastimes of the Lord in his song describing ten prominentincarnations of the Personality of Godhead, Keçava: Lord Fish, Lord Tortoise,Lord Boar, Lord Nåsiàhadeva, Lord Vämana, Lord Paraçuräma, LordRämacandra, Lord Balaräma, Lord Buddha and Lord Kalki. The wordsupacared devam indicate devotional service to the Personality of Godhead.And therefore the word tantroktena, or "injunctions of the tantras," should beunderstood to indicate vaiñëava-tantras such as Çré Närada-païcarätra, whichgive explicit and detailed instructions for worshiping Keçava. The Vedas arereferred to by the term nigama. And the elaborate explanation of thesenigamas is called ägama, or tantra. When the transcendental living entitybecomes perturbed by the obnoxious harassment of material bodily dualities,he becomes eager to hear from the Vedas about his transcendental situation.The word äçu in this verse indicates that those who are eager to put a quickend to material existence and situate themselves in the eternal blissful life ofperfect knowledge should directly worship Lord Kåñëa, bypassing thepreliminary Vedic rituals described in the previous verses.</div>

<div class="First">According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the word labdhvänugrahaù indicatesformal initiation by a bona fide spiritual master. It is stated in the Padma</div>

<div class="First">"One pollutes his own intelligence and exhibits severe weakness of characterwhen he rejects his own spiritual master. Indeed, such a person has alreadyrejected the Supreme Lord, Hari." The bona fide disciple should alwaysremember that his entire understanding of Vedic knowledge is coming throughthe mercy of his bona fide spiritual master. If one superficially or whimsicallyaccepts and rejects a bona fide Vaiñëava spiritual master, sometimes becomingattracted to another spiritual master, one commits a vaiñëava-aparädha, a greatoffense against the devotees of the Lord. Sometimes a foolish neophytemistakenly thinks that the relationship with the spiritual master is meant forthe sense gratification of the disciple, and therefore in the name of spiritualaspirations such a fool gives up a bona fide Vaiñëava guru. One shouldunderstand oneself to be the eternal servant of the guru. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé,however, has quoted this verse from the Närada-païcarätra:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">avaiñëavopadiñöena</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mantreëa nirayaà vrajet</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">punaç ca vidhinä samyag</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">grähayed vaiñëaväd guroù</div>
<div class="First">"One who is initiated into a mantra by a non-Vaiñëava must go to hell.Therefore he should again be initiated properly, according to the prescribedmethod, by a Vaiñëava guru."It is the duty of the bona fide spiritual master toexamine carefully the qualification of the disciple, and the disciple shouldsimilarly approach a bona fide spiritual master. Otherwise, the foolish discipleand the indiscriminate guru may both be punished by the laws of nature.One should not artificially try to assimilate all of the apparently conflictingbranches of Vedic knowledge. Vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù [Bg. 15.15].Conditioned souls have various conflicting natures, which are engaged byapparently conflicting Vedic injunctions called pravåtti and nivåtti-märga. Butthe easiest path is simply to learn the process of regularly worshipingadvaya-jïäna, Lord Viñëu. All the demigods mentioned in the Vedas areparaphernalia for the service of the Supreme Lord, Viñëu. Whatever exists inthe visible material world is also meant to be engaged in the Lord's service;otherwise, it has no value. If one artificially renounces material things usefulin the service of the Supreme Lord, he loses his spiritual qualification of seeingeverything as meant for Kåñëa's pleasure and will be forced to think of materialobjects as meant for his own sense enjoyment. In other words, material thingsshould be accepted or rejected according to the pleasure of the Supreme Lord.Otherwise, one will fall down from the standard of pure devotional service. Asstated in this verse, labdhvänugraha äcäryät: such discrimination can belearned when one receives the mercy of a bona fide spiritual master, whoreveals to the sincere disciple the practical application of Vedic knowledge.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Präëäyäma is the authorized Vedic process for controlling the air withinthe body. Similarly, bhüta-çuddhi is a process for purifying the body. The wordçuciù means that one should be internally and externally clean. Çuciù meansthat one should perform activities only for the pleasure of the SupremePersonality of Godhead. If somehow or other one can remember the SupremeLord constantly by chanting and hearing His holy name, one will come to thepure stage of life, as described in this Vedic mantra:</div>

<div class="First">Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has pointed out that although onemay mark the body with sacred tilaka, perform mudräs and chant mantras, ifone is thinking within his mind of material sense gratification his worship ofLord Çré Hari is bogus. Therefore the word çuciù here indicates that one shouldworship the Lord in a favorable frame of mind, considering the Lord to besacred and one's self to be an insignificant servant of the Lord. Those who arenot favorably inclined toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead do not liketo worship the Deity in the temple, and they discourage people from going tothe temple of the Lord by saying that since the Lord is omnipresent there is noneed to do so. Such envious persons prefer the gymnastic exercises ofhaöha-yoga or the räja-yoga system. But statements by the Lord Himself, suchas väsudevaù sarvam iti and mäà ekaà çaraëaà vraja [Bg. 7.19], indicate that inmature transcendental realization one understands that the SupremePersonality of Godhead is the source of everything and therefore the onlyworshipable object. Thus the devotees who worship the Deity of the Lordaccording to the païcarätra system are not attracted by any yoga process except bhakti-yoga.</div>

<div class="Chapnum">4. Drumila Explains the Incarnations of Godhead to King</div>
<div class="First"> Nimi</div>
<div class="First">The various forms of the past, present and future incarnations of theSupreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Hari, and the various transcendentalcharacteristics of each of these avatäras constitute the subject matter of this chapter.</div>
<div class="First">Even if it were ever possible to count all the particles of dust on the face ofthe earth, any attempt to count all the innumerable transcendental qualities ofthe unlimited Lord Hari, the foundation of all potencies, would be simplymadness. The Personality of Godhead Näräyaëa created the universe out ofthe five elements manufactured by His own mäyä, entered into that universein the form of the Supersoul and became known as the Puruña-avatära. Heeffects the work of creation in the mode of passion through the personal formof Brahmä, of protection in the mode of goodness through the form of the Lordof sacrifice, Viñëu, and of annihilation in the mode of ignorance through theform of Rudra. Incarnating in the form of Nara-Näräyaëa, the greatest ofsages, from the womb of Mürti, the daughter of Dakña and wife of Dharma, Hepreached by His own practical demonstration the science of naiñkarmyam.When Cupid (Kandarpa) and his hosts were sent to Badarikäçrama by KingIndra, who had become fearful and envious at seeing the austerities of LordNara-Näräyaëa, that best of sages welcomed Cupid as an honored guest. Thepacified Cupid then offered prayers to the Supreme PersonalityNara-Näräyaëa Åñi. By the order of the sage, Cupid returned from there withUrvaçé and upon presenting himself before Indra related to him everything that had taken place.</div>
<div class="First">The Personality of Godhead Lord Viñëu has appeared in various partialincarnations for the benefit of the entire world and has given instructions inspiritual knowledge in the forms of Haàsa, Dattätreya, Sanaka and the otherKumära brothers, and Åñabhadeva. In the form of Hayagréva He killed thedemon Madhu and saved all the Vedas. In the avatära of Matsya, the fish, Heprotected both the earth and Satyavrata Manu. In the incarnation of Varäha,the boar, He delivered the earth and destroyed Hiraëyäkña; in that of Kürma,the tortoise, He carried Mandara Mountain upon His back; and in the form ofÇré Hari He gave liberation to the king of the elephants. The Lord deliveredthe Välakhilyas, who had been trapped in the water in a cow's hoofprint, Hedelivered Indra from the reaction for murdering a brähmaëa, and He deliveredthe wives of the demigods from imprisonment in the palaces of the demoniacasuras. In the avatära of Nåsiàha, He killed Hiraëyakaçipu. In the reign ofeach Manu He kills the demons, fulfills the needs of the demigods and protectsall the planetary systems. In the form of Vämana, the dwarf brähmaëa boy, Hecheated Bali Mahäräja; in the form of Paraçuräma He rid the earth of kñatriyastwenty-one times; and in the form of Çré Räma He brought the ocean underHis submission and killed Rävaëa. Descending into the Yadu dynasty, Heremoved the burden of the earth. In the form of Buddha, by His argumentativepreaching in defiance of the Vedas He bewildered the demons who wereunqualified to perform sacrifices, and at the end of Kali-yuga He will destroythe çüdra kings in His form of Kalki. In this way the innumerable appearancesand activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Hari are described.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In this Fourth Chapter the son of Jayanté, Drumila, will address King Nimi.The forty-eighth verse of the Third Chapter stated, mürtyäbhimatayätmanaù:"One should worship the particular form of the Lord most attractive tooneself." Similarly it was stated in the previous chapter, stavaiù stutvä nameddharim: "One should bow down to Lord Hari after glorifying Him withprayers." Thus it is assumed that the worshiper has knowledge of the SupremeLord's transcendental qualities and pastimes in order to execute the process ofworship previously described. King Nimi, therefore, is eagerly inquiring aboutthe various incarnations of the Supreme Lord so that he can ascertain whichparticular form of the Supreme Lord is most suitable for his personal worship.It is understood that King Nimi is a Vaiñëava, or devotee, who is trying toadvance in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="First">It is important to note in this regard that the word abhimata-mürti, meaning"one's most desirable form," does not indicate that one may concoct a form ofthe Lord by one's own whim. Advaitam acyutam anädim ananta-rüpam [Bs.5.33]. All the forms of the Supreme Lord are anädim, or eternal. Thus there isno question of concocting a form, because such a concoction would be ädi, orthe origin of the concocted form. Abhimata-mürti means that among theeternal forms of the Lord one should select that form which most inspires one'slove for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such love cannot be imitated,but it is automatically aroused when one follows the prescribed rules andregulations given by the bona fide spiritual master and submissively hears these descriptions of Çrémad-Bhägavatam.</div>

In other words, although it isimpossible to describe the Lord fully, foolish atheistic scientists attempt todescribe all knowledge without even having reached the most preliminaryknowledge of the Personality of Godhead. Such atheistic persons should beunderstood to be shortsighted and of very weak intelligence, despite theirshowy material achievements, which ultimately end in great suffering anddestruction. It is said that Lord Anantadeva Himself, with His innumerabletongues, cannot even begin to vibrate completely the glories of the SupremePersonality of Godhead. The example given in this verse is very nice. Nohuman being can hope to count the number of particles on the surface of theearth; therefore no one should foolishly try to understand the Supreme Lordby his own tiny endeavor. One should submissively hear knowledge of God asit is spoken by God Himself in Bhagavad-gétä, and thus one should gradually beelevated to the stage of hearing Çrémad-Bhägavatam. According to CaitanyaMahäprabhu, by tasting a drop of seawater one can get a general idea of theflavor of the entire ocean. Similarly, by submissively hearing about thePersonality of Godhead one can acquire a qualitative understanding of theAbsolute Truth, although quantitatively one's knowledge can never be complete.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The words bhütaiù païcabhiù in this verse refer to the five gross materialelements—earth, water, fire, air and sky—which form the basic buildingblocks of the material world. When the conditioned living entity enters withinthese five elements, consciousness becomes manifest, along with the functionsof the mind and intelligence. Unfortunately, the consciousness manifest underthe modes of material nature is governed by ahaìkära, or false ego, in whichthe living entity wrongly considers himself the enjoyer of the materialelements. Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Puruñottama, enjoysHis pure transcendental existence in the spiritual sky, the material elementsare also meant for His enjoyment, through the process of yajïa, or sacrifice.This material world is called Devé-dhäma, or the abode of the illusory energy ofthe Lord, Mäyä-devé. The Brahma-saàhitä explains that the Supreme Person isnot at all attracted to His inferior energy, mäyä, but when the materialcreation is used in the devotional service of the Lord, the Lord becomesattracted by the devotion and sacrifice of the living entities, and thus,indirectly, He is also the enjoyer of the material world.We should not think that the pastimes of Lord Näräyaëa as the Supersouland creator of this universe are on a lower spiritual level than Näräyaëa'seternal pastimes in the spiritual world. Were Lord Näräyaëa in any way todiminish His transcendental bliss and knowledge in His activities of materialcreation, He would have to be considered a conditioned soul, affected bycontact with the illusory potency. But since Lord Näräyaëa is eternally alooffrom the influence of mäyä, His activities as the Supersoul of this universe areexactly on the same transcendental level as His activities in the spiritualworld. All the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are part and parcel of His unlimited spiritual pastimes.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Within His body are elaborately arranged the three planetary systems of this universe. His transcendental senses generate the knowledge-acquiring and active senses of all embodied beings. His consciousness generates conditioned knowledge, and His powerful breathing produces the bodily strength, sensory power and conditioned activities of the embodied souls. He is the prime mover, through the agency of the material modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. And thus the universe is created, maintained and annihilated.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">When a conditioned soul becomes completely exhausted by his strenuousactivities, or when he is overcome by disease, death or fear, he loses all powerto manifest practical knowledge or activities. Thus we should understand thatindependent of the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead we canneither work nor cultivate knowledge. By the mercy of the Personality ofGodhead the conditioned soul acquires a material body, which is a pervertedreflection of the unlimited spiritual body of the Lord. Thus the living entityengages in ignorant materialistic activities for society, friendship and love. Butthe entire program suddenly vanishes with the unforeseen dissolution of thematerial body. Similarly, our material knowledge is always subject to becomenull and void within an instant, since the material nature is itself constantlychanging. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the prime mover behind thebirth, maintenance and destruction of the universe. And the living entityshould try to understand that Personality of Godhead who has given him somuch facility for illusion. The Personality of Godhead actually wants theconditioned soul to surrender to Him and regain an eternal life of bliss andknowledge at the Lord's side. The conditioned soul should reason, "If the Lordis giving me so much facility to merge into ignorance, surely He will give evenmore facility to come out of this ignorance if I humbly follow His direction without foolish speculations."</div>
<div class="First">This verse describes Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, the second phase of the puruñaincarnations of the Lord. This Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, who is glorified in thePuruña-sükta prayers, expands Himself as the Supersoul to enter the heart ofevery living being. Through chanting the holy names of the Lord—HareKåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, RämaRäma, Hare Hare—even in this degraded age one can find the Supreme Lordwithin one's heart. The Lord is a person as much as we are, but He isunlimited. Still, a personal loving relationship exists between the tiny livingentity and the unlimited Supreme Lord. In consideration of this personalrelationship, bhakti-yoga is the only suitable process by which to come to theultimate understanding of our constitutional position as eternal servants of the Supreme Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> In the beginning, the original Supreme Personality manifested the form of Brahmä through the material mode of passion in order to create this universe. The Lord manifested His form as Viñëu, the Lord of sacrifice and protector of the twice-born brähmaëas and their religious duties, to maintain the universe. And when the universe is to be annihilated the same Supreme Lord employs the material mode of ignorance and manifests the form of Rudra The created living beings are thus always subject to the forces of creation, maintenance and destruction.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the previous verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead was described asädi-kartä, the original person responsible for the creation, maintenance andannihilation of the material world. According to Çrédhara Svämé, ädi-kartä, or"the original doer," implies subsequent creators, maintainers and annihilators.Otherwise there would be no meaning to the word ädi, or "original." Thereforethis verse describes that the Absolute Truth expands Himself into theguëävatäras, or incarnations who carry out the creation, maintenance andannihilation of the universe through the modes of passion, goodness and ignorance respectively.</div>
<div class="First">It is significant here that although this verse mentions creation through thematerial mode of passion and annihilation through the material mode ofignorance, it does not mention maintenance by Viñëu through the materialmode of goodness. That is because Viñëu is viçuddha-sattva, or existing on theplatform of unlimited transcendental goodness. Although Lord Çiva and LordBrahmä are somewhat affected by their prescribed duties as superintendents ofthe modes of nature, Lord Viñëu is viçuddha-sattva, completely beyondcontamination even by the material mode of goodness. As described in theVedas, na tasya käryaà karaëaà ca vidyate: the Lord has no occupational duty.Whereas Lord Çiva and Lord Brahmä are understood to be servants of the Lord, Viñëu is completely transcendental.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, Viñëu, described in this verse askratu-patiù, the Lord of sacrifice, is understood to have appeared in a previousage as the incarnation Suyajïa, the son of Prajäpati Ruci. Whereas Brahmäand Çiva faithfully engage in service to the Supreme Lord, Viñëu is theSupreme Lord Himself, and therefore His activities of maintaining thebrähmaëas and religious principles, as mentioned in this verse(dvija-dharma-setuù), are not occupational duties but lélä. So in addition tobeing a guëävatära, Viñëu is also a lélävatära, according to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé.The Mahäbhärata (Çänti-parva) describes the birth of Lord Brahmä from thelotus flower emanating from Viñëu and the subsequent birth of Lord Çiva fromthe angry eyes of Lord Brahmä. Viñëu, however, is the self-manifestedPersonality of Godhead who enters the material universe by His own internal potency, as stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (3.8.15):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tal loka-padmaà sa u eva viñëuù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">prävéviçat sarva-guëävabhäsam</div>
<div class="First">In conclusion, Lord Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is thesupreme controller whose personal form is full of eternal existence, knowledgeand bliss, who is beginningless but is the beginning of everything, who isknown as Govinda, and who is the original cause of all causes, as stated inBrahma-saàhitä. Still, that same eternal Lord manifests Himself as Brahmäand Çiva in the sense that the primeval controllers Brahmä and Çiva manifestthe potency and supreme will of the Lord, although they themselves are not supreme.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Nara-Näräyaëa Åñi, who is perfectly peaceful and is the best of sages, was born as the son of Dharma and his wife Mürti, the daughter of Dakña. Nara-Näräyaëa Åñi taught the devotional service of the Lord, by which material work ceases, and He Himself perfectly practiced this knowledge. He is living even today, His lotus feet served by the greatest of saintly persons.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">It is understood that Nara-Näräyaëa Åñi spoke transcendental knowledge togreat saintly persons such as Närada Muni. On the basis of these teachings,Närada was able to describe naiñkarmyam, or the devotional service of theLord, which eradicates material work, as mentioned in Çrémad-Bhägavatam(1.3.8): tantraà sätvatam äcañöa naiñkarmyaà karmaëäà yataù. Theätma-svarüpa, or eternal form of the living entity, is devotional service to thePersonality of Godhead. But our perception of our eternal form is covered by amaterial concept of life, just as our normal understanding of our life is coveredby a dream. Naiñkarmyam, or the cessation of material work, is possible only bythe devotional service of the Lord, as stated by Närada Muni himself:naiñkarmyam apy acyuta-bhäva-varjitaà na çobhate jïänam alaà niraïjanam(SB 1.5.12). The process of transforming ordinary karma into naiñkarmya, ortranscendental work, is summarized by Çréla Prabhupäda in his commentary onthis verse spoken by Närada Muni. "Fruitive work, in which almost all peoplein general are engaged, is always painful either in the beginning or at the end.It can be fruitful only when made subservient to the devotional service of theLord. In the Bhagavad-gétä also it is confirmed that the result of such fruitivework may be offered for the service of the Lord, otherwise it leads to materialbondage. The bona fide enjoyer of the fruitive work is the Personality ofGodhead, and thus when it is engaged for the sense gratification of the livingbeings, it becomes an acute source of trouble." According to the Matsya Puräëa(3.10), Dharma, the father of Nara-Näräyaëa Åñi, was born from the rightbreast of Brahmä and later married thirteen of the daughters of PrajäpatiDakña. The Lord Himself appeared from the womb of Mürti-devé.</div>

<div class="Translation"> King Indra became fearful, thinking that Nara-Näräyaëa Åñi would become very powerful by His severe penances and seize Indra's heavenly kingdom. Thus Indra, not knowing the transcendental glories of the incarnation of the Lord, sent Cupid and his associates to the Lord's residence in Badarikäçrama.

Indra'splot to cause the falldown of Nara-Näräyaëa Åñi could not affect the Lord, butit reveals the shortsightedness of Indra himself.

<div class="First">The word gata-vismayaù, or "free from false pride," is very significant. If onebecomes proud by performing severe penances, such penances are consideredmaterial. One should not think, "I am a great, austere personality." ÇréNara-Näräyaëa could immediately understand the foolishness of Indra, andthus He was amused by the whole situation. Cupid and the heavenly women,understanding their great offense, were trembling before Nara-Näräyaëa infear of receiving a powerful curse. But the Lord, exhibiting most sublimesaintly behavior, reassured them by saying, mä bhaiù—"Don't worry aboutit"—and actually offered them nice prasädam and articles of worship. "If youdo not give Me the opportunity to act as host to the demigods and otherrespectable personalities," He said, "what will be the use of My äçrama? Myäçrama will be void without the opportunity to receive respectable personalities such as you."</div>
<div class="First">Similarly, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness isestablishing beautiful centers in all the major cities of the world.

Butthe Vaiñëavas who live in these beautiful buildings feel that the buildings arevoid if guests do not come to hear about Kåñëa and chant His holy name. Thus,one may establish a beautiful äçrama not for one's personal sense gratificationbut to execute Kåñëa consciousness peacefully and encourage others to take to Kåñëa consciousness also.</div>

<div class="First">The demigods, headed by Kämadeva, or Cupid, recognizing their offense atthe lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, Nara-Näräyaëa Åñi, here pointout the insignificant position of the demigods in relation to the Supreme Lord.Just as a farmer must pay a specific percentage of his agricultural profit to theking or political head as tax money, all human beings must offer a percentageof their material wealth to the demigods in sacrifice. In Bhagavad-gétä,however, the Lord explains that the demigods are also His servants and it is HeHimself who awards all benedictions, through the agency of the demigods.Mayaiva vihitän hi tän. Although a Vaiñëava, or devotee of the Lord, has noneed to worship the demigods, the demigods, being proud of their exaltedmaterial position, sometimes resent the exclusive devotion of the Vaiñëava tothe Lord and thus try to cause the devotee to fall down, as described in thisverse (sura-kåtä bahavo 'ntaräyäù). But the demigods here point out that Kåñëais directly the protector of His devotees. Therefore, so-called impedimentsbecome stimuli for further spiritual advancement for a sincere devotee.The demigods here state, "We thought, our dear Lord, that we could disturbYour consciousness by our foolish tricks. But by Your mercy even Yourdevotees pay little regard to us, so why should You take our foolish behaviorseriously?" The word yadi here is used to indicate the certainty that Kåñëa isalways the protector of His surrendered devotees. Although there may bemany obstacles on the path of the sincere devotee who is preaching the gloriesof the Lord, such obstacles increase the determination of the devotee.Therefore, according to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the continuous obstacles presentedby the demigods form a kind of ladder or stairway upon which the devoteesteadily progresses back to the kingdom of God.

Nevertheless, although crossing this ocean of sense gratification through severe penances, such persons foolishly drown in a cow's hoofprint when conquered by useless anger. Thus they exhaust the benefit of their difficult austerities in vain.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Those who do not accept the devotional service of the Supreme Lord can beconsidered in two categories. Those engaged in sense gratification are easilyconquered by the demigods through various weapons such as hunger, thirst,sexual desire, lamentation for the past and vain hoping for the future. Suchmaterialistic fools, infatuated with the material world, are easily controlled bythe demigods, who are the ultimate supplying agents of sense gratification. Butaccording to Çrédhara Svämé, persons who attempt to subdue the desires of thematerial senses and thus avoid the control of the demigods withoutsurrendering to the Supreme Lord are even more foolish than the sensegratifiers. Although crossing the ocean of sense gratification, those whoperform severe penances without service to the Lord eventually drown in tinypuddles of anger. One who simply performs material penances does notactually purify his heart. By one's material determination one may restrict theactivities of the senses although one's heart is still filled with material desires.The practical result of this is krodha, or anger. We have seen artificialperformers of penance who have become very bitter and angry through denialof the senses. Being indifferent to the Supreme Lord, such persons do notachieve ultimate liberation, nor can they enjoy material sense gratification;rather, they become angry, and through cursing others or enjoying false pridethey uselessly exhaust the results of their painful austerities. It is understoodthat when a yogé curses he diminishes the mystic power he has accumulated.Thus, anger gives neither liberation nor material sense gratification but merelyburns up all the results of material penances and austerities. Being useless, suchanger is compared to a useless puddle found in a cow's hoofprint. Thus aftercrossing over the ocean of sense gratification the great yogés who areindifferent to the Supreme Lord drown in puddles of anger. Although thedemigods admit that the devotees of the Lord actually conquer the miseries ofmaterial life, it is understood here that a similar result is not to be obtained byso-called yogés who are not interested in devotional service to the Supreme Lord.</div>

<div class="Chapnum">5. Närada Concludes His Teachings to Vasudeva</div>
<div class="First">In this chapter the destination of persons who are inimical to the worshipof Lord Hari, who are unable to control their own senses and who are notpeaceful is examined, along with the different names, forms and modes of worship of the Personality of Godhead in each yuga.</div>
<div class="First">From the face, arms, thighs and feet of the primeval person Lord Viñëu areborn (correspondingly and in order of the modes of goodness, passion andignorance) the four varëas-brähmaëa and so on-and also the four differentäçramas. If the members of the four varëas and four äçramas do not worshipLord Çré Hari, who is Himself directly the origin of their own creation, theywill simply fall down. Among these classes, women and çüdras, who generallyhave no contact with the hearing and chanting of hari-kathä, are on accountof their very ignorance special candidates for the mercy of great souls. Themembers of the other three varëas, becoming fit for achieving the lotus feet ofHari by second birth through Vedic initiation (çrauta-janma), neverthelessbecome confused by concocted interpretations of the Vedas. Presumingthemselves to be great scholars, although not understanding the essentialmeaning of karma, they become flatterers of other deities in their greed forfruitive results and ridicule the devotees of the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. They are fixed in family life, attached to mundane gossip andindifferent to the devotional service of Viñëu and the Vaiñëavas. They aremaddened by material opulences and pleasures, devoid of real discriminationand intelligence and always function on the mental platform. But suchattachment to family life and so on is most natural for the mass of people, eventhough it is against the best advice of çästra. To become disentangled fromsuch life in all respects is the principal teaching of the Vedas. Real wealth isthat conducive to the faithful execution of the duty of the soul, not that whichexists simply for selfish sense gratification. As a consequence of the desire toindulge the senses, men and women couple together to produce children.Engaging in animal slaughter apart from that necessary for performance ofsacrifice, these human animals themselves suffer violence in the next life. Ifbecause of excessive greed for one's own pleasure one commits violence againstliving beings. He is also attacking Lord Çré Hari, who is present in the bodies ofall living entities as the Supersoul. Opposed to Lord Väsudeva, ignorantself-cheaters completely carry out their own ruination and enter into hell.The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Hari, accepts in each of thedifferent yugas various colors, names and forms and is worshiped by variousprescribed processes. In Satya-yuga the Supreme Lord is white in complexion,has four arms, dresses as a brahmacäré, is known by such names as Haàsa and isserved by the practice of meditational yoga. In Tretä-yuga He is red in colorand four-armed, is the personification of sacrifice, is characterized by thesymbols of the sacrificial spoon, ladle, etc., is called by such names as Yajïaand is worshiped by Vedic sacrifices. In Dväpara-yuga He is of dark bluecomplexion, wears a yellow garment, is marked by Çrévatsa and other signs, hassuch names as Väsudeva and is worshiped in His Deity form by the regulationsof the Vedas and tantras. In Kali-yuga He is golden in color, is accompanied byassociates who are His primary and secondary limbs and His weapons, isabsorbed in kåñëa-kértana and is worshiped by the performance ofsaìkértana-yajïa. Since in Kali-yuga all the goals of human life can beachieved simply by the glorification of the holy name of Lord Çré Hari, thosewho can appreciate the real essence of things praise Kali-yuga. In Kali-yugamany people in South India (Draviòa-deça), in places where the Tämraparëé,Kåtamälä, Käveré and Mahänadé rivers flow, will be dedicated to the devotional service of the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="First">Persons who give up all false ego and take full shelter of Lord Hari are nolonger debtors to the demigods or anyone else. The Personality of Godhead,Çré Hari, appears in the hearts of devotees who know no other shelter thanHim and causelessly drives away all evil desires from the devotees' hearts.Videharäja Nimi, having heard elaborate descriptions of bhägavata-dharmafrom the mouths of the nava-yogendras, offered worship to them with a satisfied mind. They then disappeared.</div>
<div class="First">Devarñi Närada thereupon instructed Vasudeva about the ultimate shelterof devotional service. He told Vasudeva that although Lord Kåñëa had becomehis son, having appeared in this world to free the earth of its burden, he stillshould not think of Lord Kåñëa as his child, but rather as the SupremePersonality of Godhead. Even by meditating upon Kåñëa in a spirit of enmity,such kings as Çiçupäla attained an equal status to Him. So to attempt to sayanything more about the perfect achievement of great souls such as Vasudeva,who enjoy intimate loving relations with Kåñëa, would be a useless endeavor.</div>

<div class="First">In the Fifth Chapter of the Eleventh Canto, Camasa Åñi describes theinauspicious path of those who are unfavorable to the devotional service ofLord Viñëu, and the sage Karabhäjana explains the yuga-dharmävatäras, theincarnations of the Lord who present the authorized process of religion for each different age.</div>
<div class="First">In the previous chapter it was explained that although the demigods placeobstacles in the path of the Lord's devotees, by the mercy of the Supreme Lordthe devotees are able to place their feet on the head of such obstacles and thuspass beyond them to the supreme destination. However, for the nondevoteesthere is no such facility. As soon as the conditioned soul becomes indifferentto the devotional service of the Supreme Lord, he is immediately attracted bythe temporary varieties of matter and becomes a slave of inauspicious desires.Thus the conditioned soul, devoid of devotion for the Lord, completely forgetsthe transcendental bliss of the spiritual world, which is enjoyed in fivetranscendental rasas. Although the devotees are not overcome by the sensegratification offered by the demigods, the demigods themselves becomeabsorbed in material form, taste and smell. And similarly, those who arenondevotees also become bound by material form, taste and other senseperceptions, such as the sensuous experience of sex life. Thus they remainhovering in a dreamlike state, imagining different types of material sensegratification, and forget their eternal relationship with the Personality ofGodhead. Videharäja Nimi now inquires from Camasa Muni about the goal attained by such bewildered persons.</div>

Thus the four spiritual orders were also generated.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Those who are not spontaneously attracted to the devotional service of theLord can be gradually purified by observing the varëäçrama system of foursocial orders and four spiritual orders. According to Çrédhara Svämé, thebrähmaëas are born of the mode of goodness, the kñatriyas of a combination ofgoodness and passion, the vaiçyas of a combination of passion and ignoranceand the çüdras of the mode of ignorance. Just as the four social orders are bornfrom the face, arms, thighs and feet of the Lord's universal form, similarly thebrahmacärés are generated from the heart of the Lord, the householder orderfrom His loins, the vänaprasthas from His chest and the sannyäsa order from His head.</div>
<div class="First">A similar verse is found in the Åk-saàhitä (8.4.19), as well as theÇukla-yajur Veda (34.11) and the Atharva Veda (19.66):</div>

<div class="First">It is understood that pure devotional service to the Lord has already beendescribed by two of the Yogendras, Drumila and Ävirhotra. Camasa Muni nowdescribes the system of varëäçrama-dharma, because this system is meant togradually purify those who are inimical to the Supreme Lord, bringing themback to their constitutional position of love of Godhead. Similarly, theviräö-rüpa, or universal form of the Lord, is an imaginary form meant to helpthe gross materialists gradually understand the position of the Personality ofGodhead. Since the foolish materialist cannot understand anything beyondmatter, he is encouraged to see the entire universe as a personal form of theSupreme Lord's body. The impersonal conception of formlessness is a merenegation of temporary material variety without any concept of the Lord'sspiritual potency. The impersonal view is another kind of material speculativeconception. The Supreme Lord is full of spiritual potencies under the principalheadings hlädiné, or unlimited bliss, sandhiné, or eternal existence, and saàvit,or omniscience. It is understood from this verse that the varëäçrama-dharmasystem generated from the universal form of the Lord is a program offered bythe Lord to engage the conditioned souls in a complete social and religioussystem that gradually brings them back home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation"> If any of the members of the four varëas and four äçramas fail to worship or intentionally disrespect the Personality of Godhead, who is the source of their own creation, they will fall down from their position into a hellish state of life.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The words na bhajanti in this verse refer to those who out of ignorance donot worship the Supreme Lord, whereas the word avajänanti refers to thosewho have actually been informed of the supreme position of the Lord but stillshow Him disrespect. It has already been described that the four spiritual andoccupational orders of life are generated from the body of the Lord. In fact, theSupreme Lord is the source of everything, as described in Bhagavad-gétä (10.8):ahaà sarvasya prabhavaù. Those who foolishly do not inquire into the positionof the Personality of Godhead, as well as those who disrespect the Lord in spiteof having heard of His transcendental position, will certainly fall down fromthe varëäçrama-dharma system, as described by the words sthänäd bhrañöäù.The words patanty adhaù indicate that one who falls from the varëäçramasystem will have no means of avoiding sinful activities; nor will such a personreceive any credit for performing sacrifice, and thus he will gradually sinkdown into lower and lower species of life in hellish conditions. ÇrélaViçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has pointed out that the original cause ofoffending the Lord and falling down from one's position is one's not learninghow to properly worship a bona fide spiritual master. One who is trained tooffer respectful obeisances and worship to the bona fide spiritual masterautomatically offers proper worship to the Supreme Lord. Without the mercyof a bona fide spiritual master, even a so-called religious man will graduallybecome atheistic, offend the Lord by foolish speculation and fall into a hellishcondition of life. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has pointed out thatthe puruña mentioned in this verse is Lord Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, who isglorified in the Puruña-sükta prayers. If one is proud of his high social positionand enviously thinks that the Lord is also a creation of nature and that there isno absolute entity who is the origin of all beings, then such a puffed-up foolwill certainly fall down from the varëäçrama system and become just like an unregulated animal.</div>

<div class="Translation"> There are many persons who have little opportunity to take part in discussions about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, and thus it is difficult for them to chant His infallible glories. Persons such as women, çüdras and other fallen classes always deserve the mercy of great personalities like yourself.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the previous verse it was explained that some persons are ignorant of theglories of the Personality of Godhead (na bhajanti), whereas others, althoughaware of the Lord, ridicule Him or state that the Lord is also material(avajänanti). In this verse the first class, namely the ignorant, are described asfit candidates for the mercy of a pure devotee. The word düre indicates thosewho have little opportunity to hear and chant the glories of the Lord.According to Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura they can be explained as yesädhu-saìga-bhägya-hénäù, those who are bereft of the association of saintlypersons and pure devotees. Generally, those who are advanced in the spiritualscience of Kåñëa consciousness avoid contact with women and low-class men.In general, women are lusty, and çüdras and other low-class men are habituallyaddicted to materialistic habits such as smoking, drinking and woman hunting.Therefore, Caitanya Mahäprabhu warned the sädhus, or saintly persons, toavoid intimate connection with women and low-class men. The practical resultof such a restriction is that women and lower-class men are often bereft of theopportunity to hear the glories of the Lord chanted by saintly persons; thus ÇréCamasa Muni instructs the King that he should especially give his mercy to such fallen persons.</div>
<div class="First">Our spiritual master, His Divine Grace Çréla Prabhupäda, was severelycriticized in India for giving all classes of men and women the opportunity totake part in the Kåñëa consciousness movement. Indeed, the caste brähmaëasof India and other persons concerned only with ritualistic formalities wereshocked that Çréla Prabhupäda allowed women and persons born in low-classfamilies to take part freely in the Vaiñëava culture and even become initiatedas bona fide brähmaëas. However, Çréla Prabhupäda could understand that inthis age practically everyone is fallen. He saw that if spiritual life were to belimited to the so-called higher classes, there would be no possibility ofspreading a genuine spiritual movement all around the world. The mercy ofCaitanya Mahäprabhu is so great and the holy name of Kåñëa so potent thatany man, woman, child or even animal can become purified by chantingKåñëa's name and taking prasädam, the sanctified remnants of Kåñëa's food. InCaitanya Mahäprabhu's movement, no sincere person is restricted fromachieving the highest perfection of self-realization. Whereas the impersonalistsand yogés tend to be selfishly concerned with their individual realization andachievement of mystic power, it has always been the custom of the Vaiñëavas to be merciful to all classes of living entities.</div>
<div class="First">It is understood that the conversation between the nava-yogendras andKing Nimi took place approximately at the time of Lord Rämacandra, manyhundreds of thousands of years ago. But in the Bhagavad-gétä, which wasspoken only five thousand years ago, Lord Kåñëa Himself also states that anyperson, despite his material situation of life, can become the most dear devoteeof the Lord by full surrender to the lotus feet of Kåñëa. Therefore, the fallenpeople of Kali-yuga should take advantage of the special mercy of theVaiñëavas and join the Kåñëa consciousness movement to perfect their lives and go back home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">It is said that a little knowledge can be very dangerous. Those who arefalsely proud of material social status and who thus neglect to perfect theirworship of the Personality of Godhead are condemned in this verse. Muhyantyämnäya-vädinaù: becoming attracted by the sense gratification of high statuswithin the varëäçrama social system, such persons become more attracted toillusory material philosophy than to the Absolute Truth, which is not material.Within the Vedic system, brähmaëas, kñatriyas and vaiçyas, as mentioned inthis verse, are all offered initiation into the Gäyatré mantra and are consideredtwice-born, or highly civilized men. By studying Vedic literature, chantingVedic mantras, executing ritualistic ceremonies and worshiping the spiritualmaster and the Personality of Godhead such persons gradually come near tothe lotus feet of the Supreme Lord. If one in such an exalted position becomesproud of his status or fascinated by the heavenly material enjoyment that isundoubtedly available to the followers of the varëäçrama system, then one sobewildered returns to the illusory material platform of birth and death. Eventhe highly posted demigods become victims of mäyä's enticement, as describedin the first verse of Çrémad-Bhägavatam: muhyanti yat sürayaù.In order to justify their illusory desire to enjoy dead matter, such foolishpersons condemn themselves by minimizing the necessity of worshiping thePersonality of Godhead (avajänanti) and falsely try to give equal importance tothe karma-käëòa section of the Vedas, which awards heavenly sensegratification in exchange for the performance of prescribed ritualisticceremonies. Such bogus rationalizers are described in Bhagavad-gétä (2.42):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yäm imäà puñpitäà väcaà</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">veda-väda-ratäù pärtha</div>

<div class="First">"Men of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of theVedas, which recommend various fruitive activities for elevation to theheavenly planets, resultant good birth, power and so on. Being desirous ofsense gratification and opulent life, they say that there is nothing more than this."</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Prabhupäda's purport to this verse of Bhagavad-gétä gives a clearpicture of the offensive class of men described therein. "People in general arenot very intelligent, and due to their ignorance they are most attached to thefruitive activities recommended in the karma-käëòa portions of the Vedas.They do not want anything more than sense gratificatory proposals forenjoying life in heaven, where wine and women are available and materialopulence is very common. In the Vedas many sacrifices are recommended forelevation to the heavenly planets, especially the jyotiñöoma sacrifices. In fact, itis stated that anyone desiring elevation to heavenly planets must performthese sacrifices, and men with a poor fund of knowledge think that this is thewhole purpose of Vedic wisdom. It is very difficult for such inexperiencedpersons to be situated in the determined action of Kåñëa consciousness. Asfools are attached to the flowers of poisonous trees without knowing the resultsof such attractions, similarly, unenlightened men are attracted by such heavenly opulence and the sense enjoyment thereof.</div>
<div class="First">"In the karma-käëòa sections of the Vedas it is said that those who performthe four monthly penances become eligible to drink the soma-rasa beverage tobecome immortal and happy forever. Even on this earth some are very eager tohave soma-rasa to become strong and fit to enjoy sense gratification. Suchpersons have no faith in liberation from material bondage, and they are verymuch attached to the pompous ceremonies of Vedic sacrifices. They aregenerally sensual, and they do not want anything other than the heavenlypleasures of life. It is understood that there are gardens calledNandana-känana, in which there is good opportunity for association withangelic, beautiful women and having a profuse supply of soma-rasa wine. Suchbodily happiness is certainly sensual; therefore there are those who are purelyattached to material, temporary happiness, as lords of the material world."The significant point in this verse is that such bewildered materialists whohave become attracted to the materialistic portions of the Vedas (muhyantyämnäya-vädinaù) desire to ignore the supreme proprietorship of thePersonality of Godhead, who is the supreme enjoyer (bhoktäraà yajïa-tapasäm[Bg. 5.29]). And at the same time they wish to preserve their exalted status asfollowers of the Vedic principles. Such duplicitous persons take shelter ofmaterialistic philosophers, such as Jaimini, who deny the existence of God as atangible principle (éçvaräsiddheù) and therefore recommend material fruitiveactivities as the highest knowable truth. Such so-called Vedic philosophersamount to little more than polished atheists and are therefore understood tobe anéçvara-vädinaù, or those who preach against the supremacy of theSupreme Personality of Godhead. Although foolish materialistic followers ofthe varëäçrama system desire to maintain their exalted status as Äryans, ortwice-born men, and at the same time neglect the Personality of Godhead, it isclearly stated in the Bhägavatam (11.5.3), sthänäd bhrañöäù patanty adhaù: suchpersons inevitably fall from their position into a degraded condition of life. Asconfirmed in this verse by the word muhyanti, they fall into the darkness ofignorance. Sometimes such pompous persons even present themselves as gurus.However, Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has pointed out that they areactually laghu, or flimsy, rather than guru, or heavy with Vedic knowledge. It isone's ultimate duty to oneself (svärtha-gati) and to the Personality of Godheadto give up all materialistic activities characterized by karma and jïäna andsurrender fully at the lotus feet of the Lord. Only the most unfortunate personwill consider that there is a higher pleasure than ecstatic surrender at the lotus feet of Gokulänanda, the Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="First">The words karmaëy akovidäù refer to those who are ignorant of the art ofperforming work in such a way that there will be no future bondage. This art isdescribed in Bhagavad-gétä: yajïärthät karmaëo 'nyatra loko 'yaàkarma-bandhanaù [Bg. 3.9]). Work must be performed for the satisfaction ofViñëu, otherwise work is the cause of future bondage in the cycle of repeatedbirth and death. The word stabdhäù, "puffed up by false pride," indicates thatalthough ignorant persons do not know the art of working properly, they donot inquire from learned devotees, nor do they accept the advice of the Lord'sown men. Being infatuated by the fruitive results offered in the Vedas, suchmürkhas, or fools, think, "We are learned Vedic scholars; we have understoodeverything perfectly." Thus they are attracted to such Vedic statements asapäma somam amåtä abhüma ("We have drunk the soma juice and now we areimmortal"), akñayyaà ha vai cäturmäsya-yäjinaù sukåtaà bhavati ("For one whoexecutes the cäturmäsya sacrifice there is inexhaustible pious reaction"), andyatra noñëaà na çétaà syän na glänir näpy arätayaù ("Let us go to that materialplanet where there is no heat, no cold, no diminution and no enemies"). Suchfoolish persons are unaware that even Lord Brahmä, the creator of theuniverse, will die at the end of universal time, what to speak of materialisticfollowers of the Vedas who jump like frogs to the different celestial planets,seeking the highest standard of sense gratification. Such bewildered Vedicscholars dream of frolicking with the Apsaräs, the gorgeous society girls of theheavenly planets who are expert in singing, dancing and in general stimulatinguncontrollable lusty desires. Thus, those who are carried away by the heavenlyphantasmagoria offered in the karma-käëòa section of the Vedas graduallydevelop an atheistic mentality. Actually, the entire universe is meant to beoffered to Lord Viñëu as sacrifice. The conditioned soul can thereby graduallyelevate himself to the eternal kingdom beyond the hallucination of materialsense gratification. However, being puffed up by false pride, the materialisticfollowers of the Vedas remain perpetually ignorant of the supremacy and beauty of Lord Viñëu.</div>

They consider such so-called beggars to beunworthy objects of charity and instead perform sacrifices only for theenhancement of the false prestige of their own family members. Madhväcäryahas stated in this regard, upekñya vai harià te tu bhütvä yäjyäù patanty adhaù. Inspite of proudly considering themselves to be great performers of religiousceremonies, those who neglect the Lord and His devotees certainly fall down.Such foolish persons sometimes bless each other by saying, "May you be blessedwith the wealth of gorgeous flower garlands, sandalwood pulp and beautiful women."</div>
<div class="First">Men who are controlled by the nature of women become exactly likewomen. Materialistic women are uninterested in the devotional service of theSupreme Lord and strive for their own selfish happiness.

Being lost in such a fool'sparadise, both husband and wife mutually encourage each other in temporaryhappiness. They do not like to speak or hear about the pastimes of the Lord,but prefer to discuss their own families. Still, the devotees of the Lord, beingmature in the mode of goodness, are always ready to act mercifully toward suchconditioned souls, who are just like vain animals. When the devotees of theLord preach that human beings should not slaughter animals, materialistichouseholders are very often astonished and inquire if it is actually possible tosubsist on a vegetarian diet. Thus being completely ignorant of the materialmode of goodness, what to speak of spiritual knowledge, such condemnedmaterialists have no hope beyond the mercy of the devotees of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The Personality of Godhead is eternally situated within the heart of every embodied being; still the Lord remains situated apart, just as the sky, which is all-pervading, does not mix with any material object. Thus the Lord is the supreme worshipable object and the absolute controller of everything. He is elaborately glorified in the Vedic literature, but those who are bereft of intelligence do not like to hear about Him. They prefer to waste their time discussing their own mental concoctions, which inevitably deal with gross material sense gratification such as sex life and meat-eating.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In Bhagavad-gétä Lord Kåñëa says, vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù [Bg.15.15]. The goal of all Vedic knowledge is to know the Lord, who is theAbsolute Truth. Although this purpose of the Vedas is clearly revealed both inthe Vedic literature itself and by the self-realized äcäryas, foolish peoplecannot grasp this simple truth. They prefer to cultivate knowledge of illicit sexby discussing their sexual partners and experiences. They also eagerly describeand recommend to their friends the best restaurants for eating meat, and theyare fond of glorifying drugs and liquor by elaborately describing the drunkenand hallucinogenic effects of their sinful experiences. The materialistic sensegratifiers eagerly call one another on the telephone, congregate in clubs andcommittees, and enthusiastically go on hunting, drinking and gamblingexcursions, thus filling their lives with the mode of ignorance. They haveneither the time nor the inclination to discuss the Absolute Truth, Kåñëa.Unfortunately, they neglect the Supreme Lord, who therefore severelypunishes such foolish persons in order to bring them back to their senses.Everything belongs to the Lord, and everything is meant for the Lord'senjoyment. When the living entity dovetails his activities for the pleasure ofthe Lord, he experiences unlimited happiness. Yena sattvaà çuddhyed yasmädbrahma-saukhyaà tv anantam [SB 5.5.1]. There is actually no happiness inmaterial affairs, and the Lord mercifully punishes the intoxicated conditioned soul to bring him back to his real life.</div>
<div class="First">Unfortunately, materialistic persons do not heed the advice of the SupremeLord in Bhagavad-gétä or that of the Lord's representatives, who speak in alliedliteratures such as Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Instead, such sense gratifiers considerthemselves to be most eloquent and learned. Every materialistic personactually feels that he is the most intelligent person, and thus he has no time tohear the actual truth. Nevertheless, the Personality of Godhead, as describedin this verse, waits patiently within the heart of the conditioned soul,encouraging him to recognize the Lord, who is sitting beside him. Suchrecognition of the Personality of Godhead is the beginning of allauspiciousness and happiness for the conditioned soul.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> In this material world the conditioned soul is always inclined to sex, meat-eating and intoxication. Therefore religious scriptures never actually encourage such activities. Although the scriptural injunctions provide for sex through sacred marriage, for meat-eating through sacrificial offerings and for intoxication through the acceptance of ritual cups of wine, such ceremonies are meant for the ultimate purpose of renunciation.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Those who are not situated in pure Kåñëa consciousness are always inclinedtoward material sense gratification in the form of illicit sex, meat-eating andintoxication. They simply desire a party life of eat, drink and be merry. Suchmaterialistic persons are unwilling to give up such temporary gratificationbecause they are firmly bound up in the bodily concept of life. For suchpersons there are numerous Vedic injunctions for rituals that bestow materialsense pleasure in a regulated manner. The conditioned soul thereby becomesaccustomed to indirectly worshiping the Supreme Lord by accepting theausterity of regulated sense gratification in obedience to the Vedic way of life.Through purification the living entity gradually develops a higher taste andbecomes directly attracted to the spiritual nature of the Lord.Sometimes the fallen practitioners of the karma-käëòa section of the Vedasassert that the material fruitive results of Vedic ceremonies should never begiven up, because they are prescribed by religious scriptures. For example,there is a Vedic injunction that in the proper season a husband must approachhis wife at night at least five days after her menstrual period, if the wife hasproperly bathed and cleansed herself. Thus, a responsible householder should engage in religious sex life.</div>
<div class="First">The injunction that one must approach his wife for sex life is explained bythe Vaiñëava äcäryas as follows. Within the material world almost every man isvery lusty and desires passionate sex life with every attractive woman hemeets, or with any woman at all. Actually, for an ordinary materialistic man itis an accomplishment if he can restrict himself to relationships with hislawfully wedded wife. But because familiarity breeds contempt, the naturaltendency is for the husband to gradually become envious or resentful of thewife and desire illicit connections with other women. Such a mentality is mostsinful and abominable, and the Vedic scripture therefore orders that one mustapproach his actual wife, with a desire to beget children, and thus curtail thetendency toward illicit sexual connection with other women. Were there nosuch Vedic injunction ordering one to approach his wife, many men wouldnaturally be inclined to neglect their wives and pollute other women by illicit connection.</div>
<div class="First">However, such an injunction for conditioned souls does not apply to greatsouls who are fixed on the spiritual platform and are transcendental tomaterial sex desire. As stated in this verse, nivåttir iñöä: the actual purpose ofthe Vedic scriptures is to bring one back home, back to Godhead, back to thespiritual world. It is clearly stated by Lord Kåñëa in Bhagavad-gétä, yaà yaàväpi smaran bhävaà tyajaty ante kalevaram: [Bg. 8.6] whatever we think of at the time of death will determine our next body.</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">anta-kale ca mäm eva</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">smaran muktvä kalevaram</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yaù prayäti sa mad-bhävaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yäti nästy atra saàçayaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">(Bg. 8.5)</div>
<div class="First">If one remembers Kåñëa, he is immediately transferred to the eternal planet ofKåñëa. Therefore, since all the Vedic scriptures are meant for knowing Kåñëa(vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù [Bg. 15.15]), the ultimate goal of the Vedascannot be any type of absorption in the material senses, either licit or illicit.The Vedic regulations governing married sex life are actually meant to preventsinful illicit sex. However, one should not foolishly conclude that a lustyattraction to his wife's naked body is the perfection of self-realization andVedic elevation. The actual perfection of spiritual life is to become free fromall material desires, nivåtti, and to fix the mind on Kåñëa.Similarly there are other injunctions, governing the regulated consumptionof liquor and meat. Those who are mad after meat-eating are instructed toperform Vedic ceremonies by which they are permitted to consume five typesof five-clawed animals, namely the rhinoceros, turtle, rabbit, porcupine andlizard. Similarly, the consumption of specific liquors is allowed during highlyrestricted sacrifices performed on specific days of the year at great expense. Inthis way, other types of drunkenness and cruel animal slaughter are prohibited.One is gradually purified by performing such sacrifices, and he develops adistaste for such foolish activities as meat-eating and the drinking of liquor.The Vedic rules and regulations that gradually restrict sense gratification arecalled vidhi. The word niyama refers to injunctions governing activities thathuman beings ordinarily would not be inclined to perform. For example, it issaid, ahar ahaù sandhyäm upäséta: "One should chant Gäyatré mantra at thethree junctions of the day, every day." It is also stated, mägha-snänaàprakurvéta: "One must take bath daily, even during the coldest months ofwinter." Such injunctions prescribe activities that ordinarily would be neglected.</div>
<div class="First">Although it has been mentioned above that there are injunctions againstneglecting one's lawful wife, there is no injunction against totally neglectingmeat-eating. In other words, killing of animals is considered most abominable,and although some concession is made for the more violent class of men, oneshould actually completely give up this cruel activity because even a slightdiscrepancy in animal sacrifices will cause havoc in one s life.It should be understood that those who have become spiritually advancedby chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra under the guidelines of Çré CaitanyaMahäprabhu are expected to completely give up material sense gratification. Ifa devotee of Kåñëa duplicitously tries to take advantage of the scripturalallowances for meat-eating, intoxication or sex enjoyment, then he commitsthe tenth offense against chanting. Especially if one has accepted therenounced order of life called tridaëòi-sannyäsa, it is most abominable andreprehensible to become attracted to the Vedic injunctions prescribingregulated sex life for householders. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé there is nosuch allowance for one in the renounced order of life. The Vaiñëava sannyäsésshould not foolishly become bewildered by statements in the Vedic literature such as the following verse from Manu-saàhitä:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na mäàsa-bhakñaëe doño</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na madye na ca maithune</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">pravåttir eñä bhütänäà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nivåttis tu mahä-phalä</div>
<div class="First">"It may be considered that meat-eating, intoxication and sex indulgence arenatural propensities of the conditioned souls, and therefore such personsshould not be condemned for these activities. But unless one gives up suchsinful activities, there is no possibility of achieving the actual perfection of life."</div>
<div class="First">In the Kriyä-vidhäna it is explained that sex is permitted only during thevämadeva sacrifice, or the garbhädhäna-saàskära for begetting of religiouschildren. It is also stated that sometimes certain types of meat are used inworshiping Lord Hari through sacrifices to the forefathers and demigods.Similarly, there is a form of intoxication available through drinking the somabeverage. But if a so-called brähmaëa becomes attracted to such offerings, heimmediately becomes polluted. Actually, the brähmaëas who performed suchofferings would not personally accept any type of liquor or meat. These thingswould be consumed by the kñatriyas, who were not considered at fault in accepting such remnants of sacrifice.</div>
<div class="First">However, in the movement of Caitanya Mahäprabhu it can be observedthat those who desire to become advanced devotees of Kåñëa immediately giveup all such fruitive sacrifices. There is no scope in pure devotional service forany type of fruitive sacrifices. Caitanya Mahäprabhu demanded that all of Hissincere followers engage twenty-four hours a day in çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù[SB 7.5.23], hearing and chanting the glories of the Personality of Godhead.Those who claim to be followers of Caitanya Mahäprabhu and who areseriously planning on going back home, back to Godhead, in the near futureshould not become mindlessly attracted by Vedic fruitive rituals that aremeant to attract those who are hopelessly bound up in the material, bodilyconcept of life. The followers of Caitanya Mahäprabhu always remain aloof from such tainted rituals.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The only proper fruit of acquired wealth is religiosity, on the basis of which one can acquire a philosophical understanding of life that eventually matures into direct perception of the Absolute Truth and thus liberation from all suffering. Materialistic persons, however, utilize their wealth simply for the advancement of their family situation. They fail to see that insurmountable death will soon destroy the frail material body.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Those things that come under the control of the proprietor are calleddhanam, or wealth. When a foolish person becomes addicted to spending all ofhis hard-earned money to increase the prestige of his material body and family,he is no longer able to see how death is steadily approaching his own body aswell as the temporary bodies of his family and friends. Måtyuù sarva-haraçcäham: [Bg. 10.34] the Supreme Lord appears as all-powerful death, whichdestroys all material situations. Actually, even in family life one should useone's wealth for spiritual advancement of oneself and one's family. In theKåñëa consciousness movement there are many religious householders who livea simple, peaceful life and use their wealth for arranging Kåñëa consciousactivities at home and for helping the renounced brahmacärés and sannyäséswho are actively preaching Kåñëa consciousness in public places. Suchhouseholders, even those who are not able to dedicate one hundred percent oftheir energy to Kåñëa consciousness, gradually acquire a very solidunderstanding of the spiritual principles of life and eventually becometranscendentalists firmly fixed at the lotus feet of Kåñëa. Thus they freethemselves from all of the anxieties of conditional life, namely birth, old age, disease and death.</div>
<div class="First">Life without Kåñëa consciousness is actually poverty, but thepoverty-stricken materialist, whose intelligence is limited, cannot perceivethat real wealth is the expansion of consciousness up to the highest level ofKåñëa consciousness, love of Godhead. Such persons raise their children to bejust like animals, having as their only goal false prestige and material sensegratification. Such materialistic householders fear that excessive interest inspiritual life may damage the ambition of their children to acquire falsematerial prestige. Actually, death will smash all of the endeavors and plans ofsuch spiritually impoverished materialists. If family life and wealth are used forKåñëa consciousness, one will learn to discriminate between the eternal andthe noneternal, between spirit and matter, between bliss and anxiety, and thusthe living entity will become liberated and go beyond mere theoreticalknowledge to acquire the highest perfectional benediction of eternal Kåñëaconscious life. Limited sensory knowledge, pratyakña-jïäna, is useless withouttheoretical spiritual knowledge, parokña-jïäna, which gradually matures, withcareful cultivation, into direct realized knowledge of the soul, aparokña-jïäna.The word anupraçänti in this verse indicates that by spiritual knowledge(vijïänam) one achieves the most sublime state of eternal peace and bliss, farbeyond the dreams of the materialistic conditioned soul.</div>

<div class="Translation"> According to the Vedic injunctions, when wine is offered in sacrificial ceremonies it is later to be consumed by smelling, and not by drinking. Similarly, the sacrificial offering of animals is permitted, but there is no provision for wide-scale animal slaughter. Religious sex life is also permitted, but only in marriage for begetting children, and not for sensuous exploitation of the body. Unfortunately, however, the less intelligent materialists cannot understand that their duties in life should be performed purely on the spiritual platform.</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">svargasya na tu märaëam</div>
<div class="First">According to this statement, the Vedas sometimes prescribe animal sacrifice inritual performances for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord or a particulardemigod. If, however, one whimsically slaughters animals without rigidlyfollowing the Vedic prescriptions, such killing is actual violence and shouldnot be accepted by any intelligent person. If the animal sacrifice is perfectlyperformed, the sacrificed animal immediately goes to the heavenly planets ofthe demigods and the forefathers. Therefore such a sacrifice is not for killinganimals but for demonstrating the potency of Vedic mantras, by the power ofwhich the sacrificed creature is immediately promoted to a higher situation.Caitanya Mahäprabhu, however, has forbidden such animal sacrifice in thisage because there are no qualified brähmaëas to chant the mantras, and theso-called sacrificial arena becomes an ordinary butcher shop. And in an earlierera, when unscrupulous persons tried to establish that animal killing andmeat-eating are acceptable by misinterpreting the Vedic sacrifices, LordBuddha personally appeared and rejected their heinous proposition. This is described by Jayadeva Gosvämé:</div>

Rather than follow the Vedic injunctions forsimultaneously satisfying their senses and gradually elevating themselves, theconditioned souls reject the actual purpose of such apparently materialisticceremonies and simply become more and more degraded in the ignorance ofthe bodily concept of life. Thus they fall down altogether from the varëäçramasystem and, taking birth in violent non-Vedic societies, foolishly presume thesmall fragments of universal religious principles prevalent there to be theexclusive religion of the soul. As a result, they fall into fanaticism, embracingmerely sectarian, dogmatic views of religion. Such unfortunate persons arecompletely out of touch with their own eternal function in life and considerthings to be vastly different than they are in reality.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In this verse we can clearly see the great discrepancies in those persons whodo not surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His law. Asstated in the Bhägavatam, haräv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guëäù: those who donot accept the supremacy of the Supreme Lord gradually become infected withthe most sinful propensities that bring, in their turn, terrible suffering uponthe nondevotees. In the Western countries such as America, many peopleproudly proclaim themselves to be most pious religionists and sometimes evenprophets or representatives of God. Boasting of their religiosity, such foolishpeople experience no fear or doubt in cruelly slaughtering innumerableanimals in slaughterhouses or on hunting trips for their whimsical sensegratification. In the state of Mississippi there are sometimes pig-killingfestivals, in which entire families enjoy watching a pig cruelly butcheredbefore their eyes. Similarly, a former president of the United States fromTexas did not consider any social occasion complete without the slaughteringof a cow. Such persons mistakenly consider themselves to be perfectlyobserving the laws of God and due to such arrogant foolishness lose all touchwith reality. When a man is raising an animal for slaughter, he feeds theanimal nicely and encourages it to grow fat. Thus the animal gradually acceptsits would-be killer as its protector and master. When the master finallyapproaches the helpless animal with a sharp knife or gun, the animal thinks,"Oh, my master is joking with me." Only at the last minute does the animalunderstand that the so-called master is death personified. It is clearly stated inVedic literature that cruel masters who kill innocent animals will undoubtedly be killed in the next life by a similar process.</div>

(SB 4.25.7-8) Such punishment ofanimal killers may take place under the jurisdiction of Yamaräja on the planetof the lord of death. In other words, one who kills an animal or who eats meatundoubtedly acquires a debt to the living entity who has contributed his bodyfor the satisfaction of the meat-eater. The meat-eater must pay his debt bycontributing his own body to be consumed in the next life. Such payment ofone's debt by offering one's own body to be eaten is confirmed in the Vedic literature.</div>

<div class="First">Those who are not completely sinful experience some mitigation of themiseries of material life and thus develop a false sense of well-being within thematerial world. Because those who are materially pious generally obtainworldly prosperity, bodily beauty and a pleasant family situation, they becomefalsely proud of their position and are not inclined to associate with or acceptinstructions from the devotees of the Lord. Unfortunately, all materialactivities, whether pious or impious, are inevitably contaminated by sinfulactivity. Those who are proud of their piety and do not like to hear aboutKåñëa sooner or later fall down from their artificial position. Every livingentity is an eternal servant of Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Therefore, until we surrender to Kåñëa, our position is actually always impious.The word akñaëikäù ("not having even a moment to reflect") is significant inthis verse Materialistic persons cannot spare a single moment for their eternalself-interest. This is a symptom of misfortune. Such persons are considered tobe killing their own souls because by their obstinacy they are preparing a darkfuture for themselves from which they will not escape for a very long time.A sick man receiving medical treatment may be encouraged by thepreliminary results of the doctor's care. But if the patient becomes falselyproud of the preliminary progress in his treatment and prematurely gives upthe doctor's orders, thinking himself already cured, there will undoubtedly be arelapse. The words ye kaivalyam asampräptäù in this verse clearly indicate thatmaterial piety is a long way from perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth. Ifone gives up his spiritual progress before achieving the lotus feet of Kåñëa, hewill undoubtedly fall back down into the most unpleasant material situation,even if he has achieved impersonal realization of the Brahman effulgence.

Thus the conditioned soul isalways in ignorance, either pursuing illusory sense gratification or trying toavoid sense gratification by merging into the impersonal aspect of the Lord,called Brahman. But the actual position of the living entity is to serve theSupreme Person, who is his master. And unless one gives up one's inimicalfeelings toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no question of peace or happiness.</div>

<div class="First">The sage Karabhäjana Muni is replying to Videharäja Nimi's questionsabout the varieties of the Lord's incarnations. In Satya-yuga the Lord's color iswhite, and He wears tree bark and a black deerskin as an ideal meditativebrahmacäré. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has explained the Lord'svarious names in Satya-yuga as follows. Those who are self-realized know thissupreme reality of the Personality of Godhead as Paramätmä, Those souls whoare situated in the religious system of varëäçrama glorify Him as the haàsawho is transcendental to all the varëas and äçramas. Persons absorbed in grossmatter consider Him to be Suparëa, "the beautifully winged" basis of theconceptions of cause and effect who flies within the subtle sky of the soul, asdescribed in Chändogya Upaniñad. Persons accustomed to wandering withinthis universe of subtle and gross matter created by the Lord's illusory potencychant His name Vaikuëöha. Persons deprived of the power of transcendentalmeditation (dhäraëä), who are thus subject to falling from the path of religion,glorify Him as Dharma, or religion personified. Those who are forced to submitto the illusory modes of material nature and whose minds are uncontrolled anddisturbed glorify Him as the most perfectly self-controlled Yogeçvara. Personstainted by a mixture of the modes of passion and ignorance call Him Amala, orthe uncontaminated. Persons devoid of potency call Him Éçvara, and thosewho consider themselves to be under His shelter chant His glories by the nameUttama Puruña. Those who know that this material manifestation is onlytemporary call Him Avyakta. In this way, in Satya-yuga Lord Väsudevaappears in various four-armed transcendental forms, and the jéva souls worshipHim, each by their own particular process of devotional service. Therefore the Supreme Lord has many different names.</div>

<div class="First">When Lord Kåñëa was leaving the city of Hastinäpura, Arjuna personallyheld an umbrella over the Lord, and Uddhava and Sätyaki fanned the Lordwith decorated fans (SB 1.10.17, 18). In this way, Emperor Yudhiñöhira and hisfollowers worshiped Kåñëa as the greatest of noble kings and as the SupremePersonality of Godhead. Similarly, at the Räjasüya sacrifice all of the greatsouls of the universe elected Kåñëa as the King of all kings, the greatestpersonality, deserving of first worship. Such reverential worship of the Lord ischaracteristic of Dväpara-yuga, as described in this verse(mahä-räjopalakñaëam). With each successive yuga, namely Satya, Tretä,Dväpara and Kali, the condition of human society deteriorates more and more.As mentioned in this verse, the only favorable qualification of the residents ofDväpara-yuga is that they are jijïäsavaù, strongly desirous of knowing theAbsolute Truth. Otherwise there is no good qualification mentioned. Theinhabitants of Satya-yuga were described as çäntäù, nirvairäù, suhådaù andsamäù, or peaceful, free from envy, the well-wishers of every living entity, andfixed on the spiritual platform beyond the modes of material nature. Similarlythe inhabitants of Tretä-yuga were described as dharmiñöhäù andbrahma-vädinaù, or thoroughly religious, and expert followers of the Vedicinjunctions. In the present verse, the inhabitants of Dväpara-yuga are said tobe simply jijïäsavaù, desiring to know the Absolute Truth. Otherwise they aredescribed as martyäù, or subject to the weakness of mortal beings. If the humansociety of even Dväpara-yuga was clearly inferior to that of Satya andTretä-yugas, we can hardly imagine the truly disastrous condition of humansociety in Kali-yuga. Therefore, as will be mentioned in the following verses,human beings who have taken their birth in the present age of Kali shouldattach themselves rigidly to the movement of Caitanya Mahäprabhu to free themselves from foolishness.</div>

<div class="First">Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains that although Lord Kåñëa appeared at the endof Dväpara-yuga, great sages chanted this verse from the beginning of that age in expectation of His appearance.</div>
<div class="First">Ordinary living entities, although eternally subordinate to the Lord,become absorbed in attempting to dominate the material creation yetultimately remain under the control of the Supreme Lord. The constitutionalposition of the living entity is engagement in the Lord's service. It is furtherthe constitutional position of the material nature to be engaged by the livingentity in satisfying the transcendental desires of the Lord. Thus these prayers,as mentioned in this verse, are offered to the Supreme Lord in accordancewith the Païcarätra and the Vedic mantras so that one may become fixed inremembering his eternal subordination to the Absolute Truth.The supreme living entity, Kåñëa, eternally manifests Himself as thecatur-vyüha, or quadruple plenary expansion. The purport of this prayer is thatone should give up his false ego and pray to this catur-vyüha by offering Themobeisances. Although the Absolute Truth is one without a second, theAbsolute Truth displays His unlimited opulences and potencies by expandingHimself in innumerable plenary forms, of which the catur-vyüha is a principalexpansion. The original being is Väsudeva, the Personality of Godhead. Whenthe Godhead manifests His primeval energies and opulences, He is calledSaìkarñaëa. Pradyumna is the basis of the Viñëu expansion who is the soul ofthe entire universe, and Aniruddha is the basis of the personal manifestationof Viñëu as the Supersoul of every individual entity within the universe.Among the four plenary expansions mentioned here, the original expansion isVäsudeva, and the other three are considered to be particular manifestations of Him.</div>
<div class="First">When the living entity forgets that both he himself as well as the materialnature are meant for the Lord's service, the quality of ignorance becomesprominent, and the conditioned entity desires to become himself the master.Thus the conditioned soul imagines that he is a very important person withinsociety or that he is a great philosopher. The Vedic mantras and Païcarätragive mankind instructions about devotional service to the Personality ofGodhead, which free one from the contamination of considering oneself aprestigious member of society or a great philosopher. One in knowledge shouldrecognize himself as a tiny servant of the Supreme Absolute Truth.In Dväpara-yuga, Deity worship of the Lord is prominent. Such Deityworship is ultimately aimed at the process of çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù [SB7.5.23]. Without hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord one cannotperform Deity worship. In Deity worship it is required that the worshiperglorify the names, forms, qualities, paraphernalia, entourage and pastimes ofthe Supreme Lord. When such glorification is complete, the worshiperbecomes eligible to realize transcendental knowledge through hearing about the Lord.</div>

<div class="First">The words kaläv api, "in Kali-yuga also," are very important in this verse. Itis well known that Kali-yuga is an irreligious age. Thus it is surprising that insuch a completely irreligious age the Supreme Lord is worshiped. Therefore itis stated kaläv api, "even in Kali-yuga." In Kali-yuga the incarnation of thePersonality of Godhead does not directly assert Himself to be the Personalityof Godhead, but rather He is detected by expert devotees in accordance withthe revealed Vedic scriptures. Similarly, Prahläda Mahäräja states in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (7.9.38):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">itthaà nå-tiryag-åñi-deva-jhañävatärair</div>

<div class="First">"In this way, my Lord, You appear in various incarnations as a human being, ananimal, a great saintly demigod, a fish or a tortoise, thus maintaining the entirecreation in different planetary systems and killing the demoniac principles.According to the age, O my Lord, You protect the principles of religion. In theage of Kali, however, You do not assert Yourself as the Supreme Personality ofGodhead, and therefore You are known as Triyuga, or the Lord who appears inthree yugas." Thus it is understood that it is difficult for common people inKali-yuga to recognize the incarnation of the Lord since in this age the Lord's appearance is slightly concealed.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura the wordnänä-tantra-vidhänena indicates the importance in Kali-yuga of the Vaiñëavascriptures known as the Païcarätras or Sätvata-païcarätras. It is stated in theBhägavatam, stré-çüdra-dvija-bandhünäà trayé na çruti-gocarä: [SB 1.4.25] inKali-yuga it is impossible for ordinary people to perform highly technical Vedicsacrifices or the unbearable penances of the mystic yoga system. Such standardVedic processes are practically inaccessible for the spiritually retardedpopulation of Kali-yuga. Therefore the simple process of glorifying thePersonality of Godhead by chanting His holy names is essential in this age.Such devotional processes as chanting the holy names of the Lord andworshiping His Deity form are elaborately described in the Vaiñëava çästrasknown as Païcarätras. Such tantric scriptures are referred to in this verse, andit is stated that in Kali-yuga these devotional processes, taught by great äcäryassuch as Närada Muni, are the only practical means for worshiping the Lord.This will be more clearly explained in the following verse.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This same verse is quoted by Kåñëadäsa Kaviräja in theCaitanya-caritämåta, Ädi-lélä, Chapter Three, verse 52. His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda has given the following commentary on thisverse. "This text is from Çrémad-Bhägavatam (11.5.32). Çréla Jéva Gosvämé hasexplained this verse in his commentary on the Bhägavatam known as theKrama-sandarbha, wherein he says that Lord Kåñëa also appears with a goldencomplexion. That golden Lord Kåñëa is Lord Caitanya, who is worshiped byintelligent men in this age. That is confirmed in Çrémad-Bhägavatam by GargaMuni, who said that although the child Kåñëa was blackish, He also appears inthree other colors—red, white and yellow. He exhibited His white and redcomplexions in the Satya and Tretä ages respectively. He did not exhibit theremaining color, yellow—gold, until He appeared as Lord Caitanya, who is known as Gaurahari.</div>
<div class="First">"Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains that kåñëa-varëam means Çré Kåñëa Caitanya.Kåñëa-varëam and Kåñëa Caitanya are equivalent. The name Kåñëa appearswith both Lord Kåñëa and Lord Caitanya Kåñëa. Lord Çré CaitanyaMahäprabhu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but He always engages indescribing Kåñëa and thus enjoying transcendental bliss by chanting andremembering His name and form. Lord Kåñëa Himself appears as LordCaitanya to preach the highest gospel. Varëayati means 'utters' or 'describes.'Lord Caitanya always chants the holy name of Kåñëa and describes it also, andbecause He is Kåñëa Himself, whoever meets Him will automatically chant theholy name of Kåñëa and later describe it to others. He injects one withtranscendental Kåñëa consciousness, which merges the chanter intranscendental bliss. In all respects, therefore, He appears before everyone asKåñëa, either by personality or by sound. Simply by seeing Lord Caitanya oneat once remembers Lord Kåñëa. One may therefore accept Him as viñëu-tattva. In other words, Lord Caitanya is Lord Kåñëa Himself.</div>
<div class="First">"Säìgopäìgästra-pärñadam further indicates that Lord Caitanya is LordKåñëa. His body is always decorated with ornaments of sandalwood and withsandalwood paste. By His superexcellent beauty He subdues all the people ofthe age. In other descents the Lord sometimes used weapons to defeat thedemoniac, but in this age the Lord subdues them with His all-attractive figureas Caitanya Mahäprabhu. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains that His beauty is Hisastra, or weapon, to subdue the demons. Because He is all-attractive, it is to beunderstood that all the demigods lived with Him as His companions. His actswere uncommon and His associates wonderful. When He propagated thesaìkértana movement, He attracted many great scholars and äcäryas, especiallyin Bengal and Orissa. Lord Caitanya is always accompanied by His bestassociates like Lord Nityänanda, Advaita, Gadädhara and Çréväsa."Çréla Jéva Gosvämé cites a verse from the Vedic literature that says thatthere is no necessity of performing sacrificial demonstrations or ceremonialfunctions. He comments that instead of engaging in such external, pompousexhibitions, all people, regardless of caste, color or creed, can assembletogether and chant Hare Kåñëa to worship Lord Caitanya. Kåñëa-varëaàtviñäkåñëam [SB 11.5.32] indicates that prominence should be given to thename Kåñëa. Lord Caitanya taught Kåñëa consciousness and chanted the nameof Kåñëa. Therefore, to worship Lord Caitanya, everyone should togetherchant the mahä-mantra—Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. To propagate worship inchurches, temples or mosques is not possible because people have lost interestin that. But anywhere and everywhere, people can chant Hare Kåñëa. Thusworshiping Lord Caitanya, they can perform the highest activity and fulfill thehighest religious purpose of satisfying the Supreme Lord."Çréla Särvabhauma Bhaööäcärya, a famous disciple of Lord Caitanya, said:'The principle of transcendental devotional service having been lost, Çré KåñëaCaitanya has appeared to deliver again the process of devotion. He is so kindthat He is distributing love of Kåñëa. Everyone should be attracted more andmore to His lotus feet, as humming bees are attracted to a lotus flower.' "The incarnation of Caitanya Mahäprabhu is also described in the ÇréViñëu-sahasra-näma, which appears in Chapter 189 of the Däna-dharma-parvaof Mahäbhärata. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has quoted this reference as follows:suvarëa-varëo hemäìgo varäìgaç candanäìgadé. "In His early pastimes Heappears as a householder with a golden complexion. His limbs are beautiful,and His body, smeared with the pulp of sandalwood, seems like molten gold."He has also quoted, sannyäsa-kåc chamaù çänto niñöhä-çänti-paräyaëaù: "In Hislater pastimes He accepts the sannyäsa order, and He is equipoised andpeaceful. He is the highest abode of peace and devotion, for He silences the impersonalist nondevotees."</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The incarnation of the Personality of Godhead in Kali-yuga is describedand worshiped in this verse. The sage Karabhäjana, after describing theincarnation of Godhead in each of the three previous yugas-Satya, Tretä andDväpara—presented suitable prayers which are utilized for glorifying the Lordin each particular age. After describing the Lord's manifestation in Kali-yugawith the verse kåñëa-varëaà tviñäkåñëam [SB 11.5.32], this and the next verseare now presented to glorify the Lord's appearance in Kali-yuga as CaitanyaMahäprabhu, kåñëa-varëam. Caitanya Mahäprabhu appears in Kali-yuga andteaches everyone to chant the holy name of Kåñëa. The members of theISKCON movement are so much absorbed in kåñëa-varëam, or chanting theholy names of Kåñëa, that sometimes ordinary persons refer to them as "theKåñëas." Thus whoever comes into contact with Caitanya Mahäprabhu'smovement immediately begins to worship Kåñëa by chanting His holy name.The words dhyeyaà sadä, or "always to be meditated upon," indicate thatthere are no hard-and-fast rules in this age for chanting the holy names ofKåñëa. In Kali-yuga the authorized process of meditation is to chant the holynames of the Lord, especially the mantra Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, KåñëaKåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. Thisprocess is to be executed constantly and always (sadä). Similarly, CaitanyaMahäprabhu stated, nämnäm akäri bahudhä nija-sarva-çaktis taträrpitäniyamitaù smaraëe na kälaù: in Kali-yuga, the Supreme Lord has kindlyinvested all of His potencies in His holy name, and there are no hard-and-fastrules for chanting such names. The mention of such rules refers tokäla-deça-niyama, or regulations of time and place. Normally there are strictregulations governing the time, season, place, conditions, etc., under whichone may execute a particular Vedic ceremony or chant a particular mantra.However, one should chant the holy name of Kåñëa everywhere and at alltimes, twenty-four hours a day. Thus there is no restriction in terms of timeand place. This is the meaning of Caitanya Mahäprabhu's statement.The word paribhava-ghnam is significant in this verse. In Kali-yuga humansociety is infected with enviousness. There is great envy, even among membersof the same family, who constantly quarrel in this age. Similarly, neighbors areenvious of each other and of each other's possessions and status. And entirenations, burning with envy, go to war unnecessarily at the risk of genocidecaused by terrible modern weapons. But all of these harassments caused byfamily members, strangers, so-called friends who are unfaithful, opposingnations, financial competition, social disgrace, cancer, etc., can be relieved bytaking shelter of the lotus feet of Caitanya Mahäprabhu. It is not possible tosave the material body, but one who takes shelter of Caitanya Mahäprabhuloosens the hard knot of the heart that psychologically binds him to thehallucination of identifying with the external body or the subtle materialmind. Once this false identification is broken, one can be blissful in anyadverse material condition. Those who foolishly try to make the temporarybody eternal are wasting their time and neglecting the actual process formaking life permanent, which is to take shelter of the lotus feet of Caitanya Mahäprabhu, who is Kåñëa Himself.</div>
<div class="First">In this verse the word térthäspadam means that the lotus feet of CaitanyaMahäprabhu are the shelter of all holy places. As the Kåñëa consciousnessmovement spreads all over the world, we often find, especially in poorthird-world countries, that it is very difficult for people to travel to India tovisit the most exalted holy places such as Våndävana and Mäyäpur. Especiallyin South America it is very difficult for a large number of devotees to visitsuch places in India and purify themselves. But Caitanya Mahäprabhu is somerciful that simply by worshiping Him, Vaiñëavas throughout the worldreceive the benefit of having visited the supreme holy place, namely the lotusfeet of Caitanya Mahäprabhu. Thus there is no loss for the followers of theKåñëa consciousness movement, despite their external situation.In this regard, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has stated, kalaudravya-deça-kriyädi-janitaà durväram apävitryam api näçaìkanéyam iti bhävaù.In this age the world is so polluted by sinful life that it is very difficult tobecome free from all of the symptoms of Kali-yuga. Still, one who is faithfullyserving in the missionary work of Caitanya Mahäprabhu need not fearoccasional, unavoidable symptoms of Kali-yuga. The followers of CaitanyaMahäprabhu strictly follow the four regulative principles of no illicit sex, nointoxication, no meat-eating and no gambling. They try to always chant HareKåñëa and engage in the service of the Lord. However, it may happen that byaccident an occasional symptom of Kali-yuga such as envy, anger, lust, greed,etc., may momentarily appear in the life of a devotee. But if such a devotee isactually surrendered at the lotus feet of Caitanya Mahäprabhu, by His mercysuch an unwanted symptom, or anartha, will quickly disappear. Therefore, asincere follower of the Lord should never be discouraged in the execution ofhis prescribed duty but should be confident that he will be protected by Caitanya Mahäprabhu.</div>
<div class="First">It is also mentioned in this verse, çiva-viriïci-nutam. Lord Çiva and LordBrahmä are undoubtedly the two most powerful personalities within thisuniverse. Still, they meticulously worship the lotus feet of CaitanyaMahäprabhu. Why? Çaraëyam. Even Lord Çiva and Lord Brahmä are not safe without the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord.</div>
<div class="First">The words bhåtyärti-haà praëata-päla indicate that if one simply bowsdown without duplicity at the lotus feet of the Lord (praëata), then the Lordwill give such a sincere candidate all protection. This verse does not mentionthat one need be an exalted devotee of the Lord. Rather, it is stated that if onesimply bows down at the Lord's lotus feet he will get all protection, and thisalso applies to anyone who is trying to serve the mission of CaitanyaMahäprabhu. Even the neophyte will get all protection by the mercy of the Lord.</div>
<div class="First">In regard to the words bhaväbdhi-potam, or "a suitable boat for crossing theocean of material existence," there is the following statement by Lord Brahmäand other demigods in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam: tvat-päda-potena mahat-kåtenakurvanti go-vatsa-padaà bhaväbdhim. "By accepting Your lotus feet as the boatby which to cross the ocean of nescience, one follows in the footsteps of themahäjanas and can cross that ocean as easily as one steps over the hoofprint ofa calf." According to Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé, a follower of Caitanya Mahäprabhuis jévan-mukta, or a liberated soul. Thus the devotee is not worried about hisfuture destination, for he is confident that the Lord will quickly take himacross the ocean of material existence. Such confidence is referred to in theUpadeçämåta by the word niçcayät, meaning firm conviction about the potencyof the process of devotional service. According to Çréla Viçvanätha CakravartéÖhäkura, the statement çiva-viriïci-nutam is also understood to indicate thatCaitanya Mahäprabhu is worshiped by Lord Çiva's incarnation Advaita Äcärya and by Lord Brahmä's incarnation Haridäsa Öhäkura.</div>
<div class="First">Caitanya Mahäprabhu is addressed in this verse as mahä-puruña, meaningpuruñottama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, there isreference to mahäprabhu in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad (3.12), mahän prabhurvai puruñaù sattvasyaiña pravartakaù: "The supreme prabhu is the Personality ofGodhead, who is the initiator of the entire cosmos." Similarly, Lord ÇréGaurakåñëa is addressed by the word mahäpuruña in this verse, and the wholeintention of this verse is to offer obeisances at His lotus feet. Such lotus feetare the actual eternal object of meditation because they cut off the bondage ofmaterial life and fulfill the desires of the devotees. Although the conditionedsouls laboring arduously under illusion pursue many temporary goals in life,there is no possibility of their achieving actual bliss or knowledge. Such eternalbliss and knowledge is actually wealth. One should not neglect the lotus feet ofCaitanya Mahäprabhu, taking Him to be an ordinary person, and insteadaccept the temporary, useless shelter offered by the illusory energy of the Lord.Those yogés who falsely select some other object of meditation besides thelotus feet of the Lord are simply creating obstructions to their own eternal life.When the meditator, the meditation and the object of meditation are all onthe eternal platform of the Lord, then actual shelter has been achieved.Generally the conditioned souls are engaged in bhoga-tyäga. Sometimes theyrun madly after material prestige and sense gratification, and sometimes theydesperately try to renounce these things. However, beyond this vicious cycle ofalternating sense gratification and renunciation are the lotus feet of the Lord,which constitute the ultimate abode of peace and happiness for the living entity.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to the Vaiñëava äcäryas, this important verse of theÇrémad-Bhägavatam is understood to describe Caitanya Mahäprabhu, LordKåñëa and also Lord Çré Rämacandra. This verse appears within the discussionby the sage Karabhäjana of the yugävatäras, or the different incarnations ofthe Personality of Godhead who deliver the conditioned souls of each age. Theprayers ending with the words vande mahäpuruña te caraëäravindam areunderstood to glorify the incarnation of Lord Kåñëa in Kali-yuga known asCaitanya Mahäprabhu. Caitanya Mahäprabhu lived for twenty-four years inNavadvépa as a householder and enjoyed immense popularity among bothscholars and ordinary persons. His saìkértana movement was completelysupported by the local government, even though it was Muslim. And CaitanyaMahäprabhu had the pleasure of marrying the goddess of fortune. No ordinarywoman of the material world, no matter how gorgeous she may be, can in anyway compare with the beautiful goddess of fortune. Everyone in the universe,including Lord Brahmä, is searching after the goddess of fortune. Therefore it is stated here, surepsita.</div>
<div class="First">However, Caitanya Mahäprabhu is Lord Kåñëa appearing as a brähmaëa,and therefore He is certainly dharmiñöhaù, or the most religious. Actually theSupreme Personality of Godhead is always dharmiñöhaù, whether He appears asa cowherd boy, a great king or a brähmaëa, because the Lord Himself is theoriginal source and personification of all religious principles. However, in thepastimes of Caitanya Mahäprabhu there are very few political or economicactivities. Caitanya Mahäprabhu appeared as a great philosopher—brähmaëa,and thus He is certainly dharmiñöhaù. In Caitanya-caritämåta, in theSeventeenth Chapter of the Ädi-lélä, it is described that a certain brähmaëa,who was well known for being harsh and cursing others, could not enter thekértana hall where Caitanya Mahäprabhu was performing kértana because thedoor was locked. Being very agitated and breaking his brähmaëa's thread, hecursed Caitanya Mahäprabhu the next day on the bank of the Ganges, saying,"I shall now curse You, for Your behavior has greatly aggrieved me. You shallbe bereft of all material happiness." However, Caitanya Mahäprabhu felt great jubilation within Himself, since His mission was</div>
<div class="First">vairägya-vidyä-nija-bhakti-yoga [Cc. Madhya 6.254]—to give up the illusion ofmaterial sense gratification and staunchly engage twenty-four hours a day inthe devotional service of the Lord. Therefore, Caitanya Mahäprabhu took thiscurse as a blessing, and soon after, the Lord took sannyäsa. Thus it is stated inthis verse that by the words of the Äryan, the brähmaëa (ärya-vacasä),Caitanya Mahäprabhu took sannyäsa (yad agäd araëyam) and went travelingthrough the different forests of India on the way to Våndävana, and laterSouth India. Caitanya Mahäprabhu wanted especially to preserve the prestigeof the brähmaëa class, and therefore He decided to keep the brähmaëa's curse intact.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has explained the word mäyä-mågamas follows. Mäyä means one's so-called wife, children and bank account, whichkeep one firmly bound up in the material bodily concept of life. The wordmågam indicates mågyati, or "to search out." Thus, mäyä-mågam indicates theconditioned living entity, who is always frantically searching for the latestup-to-the-minute sense gratification in the material bodily concept of society,friendship and love. Anvadhävat indicates that Caitanya Mahäprabhu wasalways visibly going here and there, searching after the fallen conditionedsouls. Caitanya Mahäprabhu would sometimes embrace the conditioned soulson the pretext of religious friendship or ecstasy. But actually, the Lord wastouching the bodies of the conditioned souls to pull them out of the ocean ofmaterial existence and hurl them into the ocean of ecstatic love of Godhead.Thus Caitanya Mahäprabhu was the most merciful and munificentincarnation of the Lord, whose mercy surpassed the bounds of mundanediscrimination in the matter of caste, color and creed.The word dayitayä can be explained as follows. The Sanskrit word dayämeans "mercy." Thus, by grammatical derivation, the word used in this verse,dayitayä, indicates that because of being the most merciful, CaitanyaMahäprabhu was busily engaged in rescuing the fallen conditioned souls, whoare completely distracted and bewildered by the external illusory energy of theLord. The quality of being the most merciful is part and parcel of the characterof the mahä-puruña, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead.According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, this verse also describes the incarnation ofLord Kåñëa Himself in His original blackish form. Thus the wordssurepsita-räjya-lakñmém indicate çré-mathurä-sampattim, or the opulence ofMathurä. Mathurä is described in Vedic literature as the reservoir of allopulence because of the touch of the Lord's lotus feet in that precinct. ButKåñëa, although taking birth in the opulent city of Mathurä, transferredHimself to the forest village of Våndävana. In this case the word ärya-vacasäindicates the order of Lord Kåñëa's original parents, Vasudeva and Devaké. InÇrémad-Bhägavatam (10.3.22, 29) both Vasudeva and Devaké express their fearat the threat of Kaàsa, who had already killed all of Kåñëa's elder brothers.The word ärya-vacasä thus indicates that with great love they requested Kåñëato kindly make some arrangement to avoid Kaàsa. And Kåñëa, to obey theirorder, transferred Himself to the forest village of Våndävana (yad agäd araëyam).</div>
<div class="First">In this context, the words mäyä-mågam indicate the special, exaltedrelationship between Çrématé Rädhäräëé and Çré Kåñëa. Mäyä also indicatesthe internal potency of Kåñëa, yoga-mäyä. The original form of Kåñëa'sinternal potency is Çrématé Rädhäräëé. Due to the inconceivable love ofÇrématé Rädhäräëé, Lord Kåñëa becomes easily controlled by Her. Thus,mågam, or "animal" in this case indicates kréòä-mågam, or "a toy animal." Just asa beautiful young girl may play with so many dolls or stuffed animals, similarlyLord Kåñëa becomes just like a doll in the hands of the most beautiful younggirl, Çrématé-Rädhäräëé. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, Çrématé Rädhäräëéperformed innumerable types of worship in order to bind Kåñëa more andmore to Her because Çrématé Rädhäräëé cannot live without Kåñëa. Thus, dueto Çrématé Rädhäräëé's ärädhana, or worship, Kåñëa can never leaveVåndävana. He runs here and there in Våndävana, protecting the cows,playing with His friends and engaging in countless intrigues of love withÇrématé Rädhäräëé and the gopés. Thus the word anvadhävat indicates Kåñëa'sboyish activities, His running throughout the transcendental land ofVåndävana, tightly under the control of the love of Çrématé Rädhäräëé.Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has explained how this verse also describes theincarnation of Lord Çré Rämacandra. Although the Lord is completelyindependent and detached from everything, He becomes attached to His puredevotees due to their love for Him. In the great capital of Ayodhyä all of thecitizens loved Rämacandra more than can be described. In this contextärya-vacasä means that by the order of His father, who was just like His guru,Rämacandra gave up everything and went to the forest. There He exhibitedHis great affection for mother Sétä and chased after mäyä-mågam, or theillusory deer that had been created by the trick of Rävaëa. That this goldendeer was especially desired by Çrématé Sétädevé is indicated by the word dayitayepsitam.</div>
<div class="First">All of the limbs of the Lord's transcendental body are nondifferent and interchangeable, as stated in Brahma-saàhitä (5.32):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">aìgäni yasya sakalendriya-våttimanti</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">paçyanti pänti kalayanti ciraà jaganti</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">änanda-cinmaya-sad-ujjvala-vigrahasya</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi</div>
<div class="First">All of the limbs (aìgäni) of the Supreme Lord are sakalendriya-våttimanti, orpossessing all of the functions of all of the other limbs. Thus the two lotus feetof the Personality of Godhead are a plenary representation of the SupremePersonality of Godhead, and worshiping the Lord's lotus feet immediatelyplaces the worshiper in the ocean of transcendental bliss. There is no factualdifference in spiritual quality between the incarnations of CaitanyaMahäprabhu, Lord Kåñëa and Lord Çré Rämacandra. As stated in Vedicliteratures, advaitam acyutam anädim ananta-rüpam [Bs. 5.33]. Therefore thereis no contradiction in the opinions of the äcäryas that this verse wonderfullyglorifies three different manifestations of the one Absolute Truth. CaitanyaMahäprabhu is undoubtedly the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Histranscendental attributes fulfill in every sense of the term the descriptions ofthe Absolute Truth as given in Vedic literature. In Caitanya-caritämåta, in theThird Chapter of the Ädi-lélä, Kåñëadäsa Kaviräja Gosvämé and ÇrélaPrabhupäda have given elaborate explanations of the transcendental status ofÇré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, which the reader can refer to for further information.</div>
<div class="First">Everyone should follow the example of the sage Karabhäjana and worshipthe lotus feet of the Mahäprabhu, the mahä-puruña, Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu.One should not rot on the platform of mental speculation and whimsicalinterpretation but should actually revive his lost relationship with theAbsolute Truth by surrendering to Caitanya Mahäprabhu. Those who areworshiping Caitanya Mahäprabhu are deriving wonderful spiritual results andare tasting the fruit of love of Kåñëa. Therefore, vande mahä-puruña tecaraëäravindam: let us humbly bow down at the lotus feet of the originalPersonality of Godhead, Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, who is the mahä-puruña glorified within Çrémad-Bhägavatam.</div>
<div class="First">Corroborating the explanation of this verse, the followers of CaitanyaMahäprabhu also worship Him in His six-armed form of ñaò-bhuja. Two armscarry the waterpot and daëòa of the sannyäsé Caitanya Mahäprabhu, two armscarry the flute of Lord Kåñëa, and two arms carry the bow and arrow of ÇréRämacandra. This ñaò-bhuja form is the actual purport of this verse of Çrémad-Bhägavatam.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Thus, O King, the Supreme Lord Hari is the giver of all desirable benefits of life. Intelligent human beings worship the particular forms and names that the Lord manifests in different ages.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The word yugänurüpäbhyäm is significant here. Anurüpa means "suitable" or"appropriate." The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, anxiously desiresthat all conditioned living entities come back home, back to Godhead, for aneternal life of bliss and knowledge. Thus, the Lord reveals Himself in each ofthe four ages—Satya, Tretä, Dväpara and Kali—in a form appropriate forworship by the human beings of that age. In his Laghu-bhägavatämåta (Pürva-khaëòa 1.25), Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé states:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kathyate varëa-nämäbhyäà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">çuklaù satya-yuge hariù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">raktaù çyämaù kramät kåñëas</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tretäyäà dväpare kalau</div>
<div class="First">"The Supreme Lord Hari is described in terms of His color and names as çukla[white, or the most pure] in Satya-yuga, and as red, dark blue and blackrespectively in Tretä, Dväpara and Kali." Thus, although in each age variousnames suitable for glorifying the Lord are given, such as Haàsa and Suparëa inSatya-yuga, Viñëu and Yajïa in Tretä-yuga, and Väsudeva and Saìkarñaëa inDväpara-yuga, similar names are not given for Kali-yuga, although such namesexist, in order to avoid disclosing cheaply the truth of the incarnation of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu.</div>
<div class="First">In Kali-yuga human society is infested with hypocrisy and superficiality.There is a strong tendency toward imitation and fraud in this age. Thereforethe incarnation of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu is revealed in Vedic literature ina confidential, discrete way, so that it will be known to the authorized personswho can then propagate the mission of the Lord on the earth. We actually seein this modern age that many foolish and ordinary persons claim to be God orincarnations, avatäras, etc. There are many cheap philosophies and academiesthat promise, for a moderate fee, to make one God in a short time. In Americaone famous religious group promises its followers that they will all become theSupreme Lord in heaven. Such bogus preaching goes on in the name ofChristianity. Thus, were Caitanya Mahäprabhu's name widely spoken of inVedic literature, there would soon be a veritable plague of imitation Caitanya Mahäprabhus infesting the world.</div>
<div class="First">Therefore, to prevent this pandemonium, discretion is exercised in theVedic literatures in Kali-yuga, and in a sober, concealed way the actualfollowers of Vedic culture are informed through the Vedic mantras of thedescent of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. This discrete system, selected by theLord Himself for His appearance in Kali-yuga, is proving to be greatlysuccessful on the earth planet. And throughout the world millions of peopleare chanting the holy names of Kåñëa without the unbearable harassment ofhundreds and thousands of imitation Caitanya Mahäprabhus. Those whoseriously desire to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead can easilyunderstand the Lord's mission, whereas cynical materialistic rascals, puffed upby false prestige and madly considering their insignificant intelligence to begreater than the intelligence of Lord Kåñëa, cannot understand the beautifularrangements made by the Lord for His graceful descent into the materialworld. Thus, although Kåñëa is çreyasäm éçvaraù, or the Lord of allbenedictions, such foolish persons turn away from the Lord's mission and inthis way deprive themselves of their own true benefit in life.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Those who are actually advanced in knowledge are able to appreciate the essential value of this age of Kali. Such enlightened persons worship Kali-yuga because in this fallen age all perfection of life can easily be achieved by the performance of saìkértana.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">It is stated here that among the four ages—Satya, Tretä, Dväpara andKali—Kali-yuga is actually the best because in this age the Lord mercifullydistributes the highest perfection of consciousness, namely Kåñëaconsciousness, very freely. The word ärya has been defined by ÇrélaPrabhupäda as "one who is advancing spiritually." The nature of an advancedperson is to search for the essence of life. For example, the essence of thematerial body is not the body itself but the spirit soul that is within the body;therefore an intelligent person gives more attention to the eternal spirit soulthan to the temporary body. Similarly, although Kali-yuga is considered to bean ocean of contamination, there is also an ocean of good fortune in Kali-yuga,namely the saìkértana movement. In other words, all of the degraded qualitiesof this age are completely counteracted by the process of chanting the holynames of the Lord. Thus it is stated in the Vedic language,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">dhyäyan kåte yajan yajïais</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tretäyäà dväpare 'rcayan</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yad äpnoti tad äpnoti</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kalau saìkértya keçavam</div>
<div class="First">"Whatever is achieved in Satya-yuga by meditation, in Tretä by offering ritualsacrifices and in Dväpara by temple worship is achieved in Kali-yuga by chanting the names of Lord Keçava congregationally."</div>
<div class="First">The Vedic process gradually lifts the conditioned entity out of the darknessof ahaìkära, or false identification with the gross material body, and bringshim to the platform of self-realization, or ahaà brahmäsmi(95), "I am spiritsoul. I am eternal." One has to make further progress to discover that althoughone is eternal, there is a superior eternal entity, who is the Lord Himselfwithin one's own heart and within every atom in the material universe.Beyond this second phase of self-realization there is the third and final stage ofperfection, which is realization of Bhagavän, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His own abode.</div>
<div class="First">The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not primarily the superintendentof this world but rather the enjoyer of His own world, which is beyond themost fantastic dreams of the conditioned living entity. In other words,although the king or president of a country is ultimately the controller of theprison department, the king or president derives actual pleasure within hisown palace and not in administering justice to the foolish prisoners. Similarly,the Lord appoints the demigods to administer the material creation on Hisbehalf while He Himself personally enjoys the ocean of transcendental bliss inHis own transcendental kingdom. Thus, realization of the Lord within His ownkingdom is far superior to the primitive understanding that the Lord is the"creator" of the prison of the material world. This realization of Bhagavänbegins with understanding that there are innumerable Vaikuëöha planets inthe spiritual sky and that on each of them a particular expansion of Näräyaëadwells with His innumerable devotees who are attached to that particularform. The central and chief planet in the spiritual sky is called Kåñëaloka, andthere the Personality of Godhead exhibits His supreme and original form ofGovinda. As confirmed by Lord Brahmä, govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi **. Lord Brahmä also states:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">anädir ädir govindaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sarva-käraëa-käraëam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">(Bs. 5.1)</div>
<div class="First">Thus, love of Kåñëa and entrance into Kåñëa's planet in the spiritual sky is themost supremely perfect and exalted status of life available anywhere, at anytime, throughout the totality of existence. That perfection is available inKali-yuga simply by chanting the holy names of God: Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa,Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare.Therefore every sane man, woman or child should deeply understand theunprecedented opportunity offered by Caitanya Mahäprabhu and seriouslytake up this chanting process. Only the most unfortunate and irrational person will neglect this transcendental opportunity.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the Skanda Puräëa, as well as in other Puräëas, there is the followingstatement: mahä-bhägavatä nityaà kalau kurvanti kértanam. "During Kali-yugathe great devotees of the Lord always engage in kértana, chanting the Lord'sholy names." It is the nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead to bemerciful, and He is especially merciful to those who, in a helpless condition,take complete shelter of His lotus feet. One can immediately take shelter ofthe lotus feet of the Lord by chanting His holy names. According to ÇrédharaSvämé, even in previous ages such as Satya-yuga it was not possible for theliving entities to achieve the perfection that is available in Kali-yuga. Çréla JévaGosvämé has explained this as follows. In former ages such as Satya-yugahuman beings were perfectly qualified and easily performed even the mostdifficult spiritual processes, meditating for many thousands of years practicallywithout eating or sleeping. Thus, although in any age one who completelytakes shelter of the Lord's holy name gets all perfection, the highly qualifiedinhabitants of Satya-yuga do not consider that merely moving the tongue andlips, chanting the Lord's holy name, is a complete process and that the Lord'sholy name is the only shelter within the universe. They are more attracted tothe difficult and elaborate yoga system of meditation, complete withsophisticated sitting postures, painstaking control of the breath and deep,extended meditations in trance on the Personality of Godhead within theheart. In Satya-yuga sinful life is practically unheard of, and therefore peopleare not afflicted with the terrible reactions seen in Kali-yuga, such as worldwar, famine, plague, drought, insanity, etc. Although in Satya-yuga peoplealways worship the Personality of Godhead as the ultimate goal of life andmeticulously follow His laws, called dharma, they do not feel themselves to bein a helpless condition, and thus they do not always experience intense love for the Lord.</div>
<div class="First">However, in Kali-yuga living conditions are so unbearable, moderngovernments are so obnoxious, our bodies are so ridden by physical and mentaldisease, and even self-preservation is so troublesome, that the conditionedsouls intensely cry out the holy name of Kåñëa, begging for relief from theonslaught of this age. The members of the Kåñëa consciousness movementhave vivid and unforgettable experiences of the terrible contradictionsinherent in human society in this age, and thus they are firmly convinced thatthere is nothing to be achieved except the mercy of the Supreme Lord. InISKCON centers throughout the world we observe wonderfully ecstatickértana performances in which men, women and children from all walks of lifechant with startling enthusiasm the holy names of Kåñëa and dance in ecstasy,becoming completely indifferent to so-called public opinion. In America aprominent professor from Oberlin College visited a Hare Kåñëa center inCalifornia and was astonished by the enthusiasm with which the devoteeschant the holy name of Kåñëa in their congregational performances.Thus, due to their helpless and pathetic condition, the living entities inKali-yuga have great impetus to surrender fully to the holy name of Kåñëa,putting all of their hope and faith in the Lord's holy name. Kali-yuga istherefore the best age because in this age, more than in Satya-yuga or otherages, the conditioned souls become disgusted with the kingdom of illusion andsurrender fully to the Lord's holy name. This status of full surrender is called paramäà çäntim, or supreme peace.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted a passage from the book called Sväbhävya tothe effect that a bona fide spiritual master in disciplic succession is able tounderstand the mentality and capability of his disciples and engage them inworshiping the particular form of the Lord suitable for them. In this way thespiritual master destroys all obstacles in the path of his disciples. The generalrule is that one must worship the particular form of the Lord that appears inthe current yuga. One may also offer his love and worship to other forms of theLord that appear in other ages, and specifically one is recommended to chantthe holy names of Lord Nåsiàhadeva to get all protection. Practically all ofthese injunctions are being carried out within the ISKCON movement.Within the Kåñëa consciousness society, men, women and children are allbeing engaged in worshiping the Lord according to their particular natures. Inaddition, according to Caitanya Mahäprabhu's order, we are worshipingBalaräma and Kåñëa, who appeared in Dväpara-yuga, because They are theoriginal Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, by chanting theDaçävatära-stotra, jaya jagad-éça hare, and by reading Çrémad-Bhägavatam, themembers of ISKCON worship all of the plenary expansions of the Personalityof Godhead. And after every ärati performance devotional prayers are dulychanted to Lord Nåsiàhadeva for protection of this movement, which is so essential to human society.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear King, the inhabitants of Satya-yuga and other ages eagerly desire to take birth in this age of Kali, since in this age there will be many devotees of the Supreme Lord, Näräyaëa. These devotees will appear in various places but will be especially numerous in South India. O master of men, in the age of Kali those persons who drink the waters of the holy rivers of Draviòa-deça, such as the Tämraparëé, Krtamälä, Payasviné, the extremely pious Käveré and the Pratécé Mahänadé, will almost all be purehearted devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Väsudeva.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Vedas contain information of past, present and future living conditionsthroughout the universe. This is not very wonderful. For example, although atpresent time in India we are experiencing spring weather, we know that in thefuture the torrid summer will come, followed by the rainy season, autumn andeventually winter and a new spring. Similarly, we know that these seasonshave occurred repeatedly in the past. Thus, just as ordinary human beings canunderstand the past, present and future seasons of the earth, the liberatedfollowers of Vedic culture can easily understand the past, present and futureconditions of the seasonal ages of the earth and other planets. The inhabitantsof Satya-yuga are certainly aware of the conditions of Kali-yuga. They knowthat in Kali-yuga the difficult material situation forces the living entity to takecomplete shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that theinhabitants of Kali-yuga therefore develop a high degree of love of Godhead.Therefore although the inhabitants of Satya-yuga are far more sinless, truthfuland self-controlled than the people of other ages, they desire to take birth in Kali-yuga in order to taste pure love of Kåñëa.</div>
<div class="First">Without associating with the devotees of the Lord no one can become anadvanced devotee of the Lord. Therefore, since in Kali-yuga other Vedicprocesses collapse due to the unfavorable condition, and since the onlyauthorized Vedic process is the devotional chanting of the Lord's holy name,which is available to everyone, there will undoubtedly be innumerableVaiñëavas, or devotees of the Lord, in this age. Birth in this age is veryfavorable for one who is eager to associate with the devotees. In fact, the Kåñëaconsciousness movement is establishing authorized Vaiñëava templesthroughout the world so that in innumerable areas one may avail himself of association with pure Vaiñëavas.</div>
<div class="First">Association with the devotees of the Lord is far more valuable than anyamount of association with persons who are merely self-controlled, sinless orexpert in Vedic scholarship. Therefore it is stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (6.14.5):</div>

And from this pivotal point, He will gradually expandthe flood of love of Godhead to cover the entire earth. Many exalted devoteessuch as Çré Advaitäcärya also take birth in Gauòa-deça.The process of chanting the holy name of Kåñëa, kåñëa-kértana, is notlimited to Kali-yuga.

<div class="Verse-in-purp">na deça-kälävasthätmaçuddhy-</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ädikam apekñate</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kintu svatantram evaitaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">näma kämita-käma-dam</div>
<div class="First">"The name of the Lord need not be chanted with regard to place, time,circumstantial conditions, preliminary self-purification or any other factors.Rather, it is completely independent of all other processes and rewards all thedesires of those who eagerly chant it." Similarly, it is stated in the</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">Viñëu-dharma,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kalau kåta-yugaà tasya</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kalis tasya kåte yuge</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yasya cetasi govindo</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">hådaye yasya näcyutaù</div>
<div class="First">"For one who has Lord Govinda in his heart, Satya-yuga becomes manifest inthe midst of Kali, and conversely even Satya-yuga becomes Kali-yuga for onewho does not have the infallible Lord in his heart." The holy name of Kåñëa ispotent everywhere, at all times and in all circumstances; therefore one shouldalways chant the holy names of the Lord, either in Kali-yuga, Satya-yuga, inheaven, in hell or in Vaikuëöha. Kåñëa's holy name is eternally nondifferentfrom Him, and Kåñëa is eternally the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus,it is not that the holy name is powerful in this age only because other processes are not effective.</div>
<div class="First">It is also stated in the Çré Viñëu Puräëa that chanting the holy names of theLord is far more potent than simply trying to remember the Lord throughmeditation. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam (2.1.11), Çukadeva Gosvämé has stated,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">etan nirvidyamänänäm</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">icchatäm akuto-bhayam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yoginäà nåpa nirëétaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">harer nämänukértanam</div>
<div class="First">"O King, constant chanting of the holy name of the Lord after the ways of thegreat authorities is the doubtless and fearless way of success for all, includingthose who are free from all material desires, those who are desirous of allmaterial enjoyment, and also those who are self-satisfied by dint oftranscendental knowledge." In his commentary on this verse in theBhägavatam, Çréla Prabhupäda has written: "According to Çré ÇukadevaGosvämé, this way of attaining success [chanting the holy name] is anestablished fact, concluded not only by him, but also by all other previousäcäryas. Therefore there is no need of further evidence." The reader mayconsult Çréla Prabhupäda's purport to this verse for a detailed explanation ofthe chanting of the holy name of the Lord and the offenses to be avoided in such chanting.</div>
<div class="First">In the Vaiñëava-cintämaëi there is the following statement:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">agha-cchit smaraëaà viñëor</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bahv-äyäsena sädhyate</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">oñöha-spandana-mätreëa</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kértanaà tu tato varam</div>
<div class="First">"Although capable of destroying all sins, the remembrance of Lord Viñëu isachieved only with extraordinary effort. On the other hand, one may performkåñëa-kértana simply by moving one's lips, and thus this process is superior."Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has also quoted the following verse:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yena janma-çataiù pürvaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">väsudevaù samärcitaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tan-mukhe hari-nämäni</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sadä tiñöhanti bhärata</div>
<div class="First">"O descendant of Bharata, the holy names of Lord Viñëu are always vibratingin the mouth of one who has previously worshiped Väsudeva perfectly forhundreds of lifetimes." The same idea is conveyed in the Çrémad-Bhägavatamby Çrématé Devahüti in her statement to her son, Kapila:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">aho bata çva-paco 'to garéyän</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yaj-jihvägre vartate näma tubhyam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tepus tapas te juhuvuù sasnur äryä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">brahmänücur näma gåëanti ye te</div>
<div class="First">"Oh, how glorious are they whose tongues are chanting Your holy name! Evenif born in the families of dog-eaters, such persons are worshipable. Persons whochant the holy name of Your Lordship must have executed all kinds ofausterities and fire sacrifices and achieved all the good manners of the Aryans.To be chanting the holy name of Your Lordship, they must have bathed atholy places of pilgrimage, studied the Vedas and fulfilled everything required." (SB 3.33.7)</div>
<div class="First">Therefore, Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has concluded that it is possible to performkértana equally in all ages. In Kali-yuga, however, the Supreme Personality ofGodhead, by His causeless mercy, personally induces the living entities to takethe holy name. Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura has thus quoted the Lord as follows:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">enechi auñadhi mäyä näçibära lägi'</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">hari-näma mahä-mantra lao tumi mägi'</div>
<div class="First">"O conditioned souls who are foolishly sleeping on the lap of the witch Mäyä, Ihave brought an excellent medicine to cure the disease of your illusion. Thismedicine is called hari-näma. It is My holy name, and by taking this medicineyou will get all perfection in life. Therefore, I sincerely request you to pleasetake this medicine that I have personally brought for you."In verse 32 of this chapter it was stated, yajïaiù saìkértana-präyair yajanti hisu-medhasaù. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé the words saìkértana-präyaiù,which mean "mainly by the process of saìkértana," indicate that although otherprocesses such as Deity worship may be performed to some extent in Kali-yuga,such processes, in order to be successful, must be favorably connected with thechanting of the holy names of the Lord. One who is performing worship of theKåñëa Deity should know that the most essential part of such Deity worship isconstant chanting of the holy names of the Lord. On the other hand, one whohas perfectly chanted the holy name of the Lord need not depend on otherprocesses, as expressed in the following famous mantra:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">harer näma harer näma</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">harer nämaiva kevalam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kalau nästy eva nästy eva</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nästy eva gatir anyathä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">[Cc. Ädi 17.21]</div>
<div class="First">"In this age of Kali there is no alternative, there is no alternative, there is noalternative for spiritual progress other than the holy name, the holy name, theholy name of the Lord." (Båhan-näradéya Puräëa 38.126) As proved by all ofthese evidences, the statement in the Bhägavatam (kalià sabhäjayanty äryäù)that spiritually advanced persons worship the age of Kali due to the facilitiesoffered in this age by the Lord is not at all contradictory.At the end of verse 40 in this chapter it is stated, präyo bhaktä bhagavativäsudeve 'maläçayäù: in general those who are able to regularly drink thewaters of the holy rivers of South India will be pure-hearted devotees of LordVäsudeva. The word präyaù, or "in general" indicates that those who areoffensive to the Lord's devotees, although claiming themselves to be devotees,are not included within the list of amaläçayäù, or purehearted souls. ÇrélaBhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has pointed out that one should not bebewildered by seeing the apparently poverty-stricken condition of theinhabitants of South India. Even nowadays the inhabitants of the placesmentioned in this verse generally spend their days with meager eating andclothing and live as great renounced devotees of the Supreme Lord. In otherwords, clothes do not make the man. To live as a polished animal, dressingoneself luxuriously and gratifying the tongue with rich foodstuffs, is not theactual symptom of an advanced transcendentalist. Although the residents ofSouth India are generally Çré Vaiñëavas, or devotees in theLakñmé-sampradäya, they are recognized as devotees of the Lord by thefollowers of Caitanya Mahäprabhu. According to Çréla BhaktisiddhäntaSarasvaté Öhäkura, their austere living conditions should be taken as a good qualification, not a disqualification.</div>

<div class="Translation"> O King, one who has given up all material duties and has taken full shelter of the lotus feet of Mukunda, who offers shelter to all, is not indebted to the demigods, great sages, ordinary living beings, relatives, friends, mankind or even one's forefathers who have passed away. Since all such classes of living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, one who has surrendered to the Lord's service has no need to serve such persons separately.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">One who has not fully surrendered to the devotional service of the Lordundoubtedly has many material duties to perform. Every ordinary conditionedsoul is the recipient of innumerable benefits given by the demigods, whoprovide sun and moonshine, rain, wind, food and, ultimately, one's ownmaterial body. In Bhagavad-gétä it is stated, stena eva saù: [Bg. 3.12] one whodoes not reciprocate with the demigods by offering them sacrifice is stena, or athief. Similarly, other living entities such as cows are providing us withinnumerable delicious and nutritious foodstuffs. When we wake up in themorning our mind is refreshed by the sweet singing of birds, and on a hot daywe enjoy the cool shade and breeze of the forest trees. We are acceptingservice from innumerable living entities, and we are obligated to repay them.Äpta means one's own family members, to whom one is certainly obligatedaccording to normal morality, and nåëäm means human society. Until onebecomes a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is certainly aproduct of his society. We receive mundane education, culture, tradition andprotection from the society in which we live, and thus we owe a great debt tosociety. Of course, our debt to society is not simply to the present order but toall of our forefathers and ancestors who carefully preserved moral and socialcustoms so that we, their descendants, could live peacefully. Therefore theword pitèëäm, or "forefathers," indicates our debt to previous generations.In fact, the members of the Kåñëa consciousness society are sometimescriticized by materialistic persons for giving too much attention to Kåñëarather than working to fulfill all of the above-mentioned obligations. In replyto this, the Bhägavatam (4.31.14) states, yathä taror müla-niñecanena tåpyantitat-skandha-bhujopaçäkhäù. If one waters the root of a tee, automatically all ofthe branches, twigs, leaves, etc., are also nourished. There is no need for, norany effectiveness in, separately pouring water on the branches, twigs andleaves of a tree. The water has to be placed on the root. Similarly,präëopahäräc ca yathendriyäëäm: food must be placed in the stomach, fromwhere it is automatically distributed to all of the limbs of the body. It is foolishto try to nourish the whole body by rubbing food separately on all the bodilylimbs. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is the source ofall existence. Everything is emanating from Kåñëa, everything is maintained byKåñëa, and at the end, everything will merge to rest in Kåñëa. The SupremePersonality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is the supreme benefactor, friend, protectorand well-wisher of every living entity, and if He is satisfied, then automaticallythe whole world will become satisfied, just as all of the bodily limbs arestrengthened and satisfied when food is duly remitted to the stomach.The example can be given that a man who is working as the personalsecretary to a great king has no further obligation to petty minor kings.Undoubtedly an ordinary person has many obligations within this materialworld. But according to Bhagavad-gétä, mayaiva vihitän hi tän: it is actually theSupreme Lord who is giving all benedictions. For example, one receives one'sbody by the mercy of one's parents. However, sometimes we find that aparticular man or woman may become impotent at a given moment.Sometimes a deformed child is born, and sometimes a child is born dead. Oftenthe sexual act fails to produce pregnancy at all. So although all parents desire abeautiful, highly qualified child, this is often not the case. Thus it can beunderstood that ultimately it is by the mercy of the Supreme Lord that a manand woman are able to produce a child by the sexual act. It is by the Lord'smercy that the man's seminal injection is potent and the woman's ovum isfertile. Similarly, it is only by the mercy of the Lord that the child is born in ahealthy condition and reaches physical maturity to pursue his own life. If atany stage in the evolution of a human being the Lord's mercy is withdrawn, sudden death or crippling disease occurs.</div>
<div class="First">The demigods are also not independent. The words parihåtya kartam,"giving up other duties," indicate that one should give up any concept that thedemigods are separate from Kåñëa. It is clearly stated in Vedic literature thatthe demigods are different limbs of the universal body of the Supreme Lord.Further, it is stated in Bhagavad-gétä that the Supreme Lord is situated ineveryone's heart and that He only is giving intelligence and memory. Thus, ourforefathers who carefully preserved cultural traditions were acting withintelligence provided by the Supreme Lord. They certainly were not actingwith their own independent intelligence. No one can be intelligent without abrain, and it is only by Kåñëa's mercy that we receive a human brain.Therefore, if we carefully analyze all of our multifarious obligations towarddifferent classes of living entities, we shall find that in each and every case it isultimately by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that we havereceived a particular benediction in life. So although an ordinary person mustmethodically fulfill all of his various obligations by executing different types ofsacrifices and charitable activities for the satisfaction of those who havebenefited him, one who is directly serving the Supreme Personality ofGodhead, Kåñëa, at once fulfills all such obligations because all benedictionsultimately have come from the Lord through the agency of family, forefathers, demigods, etc.</div>
<div class="First">The example may be given that sometimes a state government maydistribute benefits originally provided by the federal government. So one whobecomes the personal secretary or minister to the chief executive of the federalgovernment has no further obligation to the less important representatives ofthe state government. Therefore, it is stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (11.20.9):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tävat karmäëi kurvéta</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na nirvidyeta yävatä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mat-kathä-çravaëädau vä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">çraddhä yävan na jäyate</div>
<div class="First">"As long as one is not satiated by fruitive activity and has not awakened histaste for devotional service by hearing and chanting about the Supreme Lord,one has to act according to the regulative principles of the Vedic injunctions."The conclusion is that one who has fully surrendered to the devotional service of the Supreme Lord is a first-class human being.</div>
<div class="First">People in general are only eager to receive benedictions from demigods,family members and society because such benedictions are conducive tomaterial sense gratification. Less intelligent persons consider such materialprogress to be the only goal of life and thus cannot appreciate the exaltedposition of pure devotional service to the Lord. Bhakti-yoga, or pure devotionalservice, is meant to directly please the senses of the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. Envious materialistic persons propose various arguments to denythat the Supreme Lord even has transcendental senses. The devotees,however, do not waste!time doubting the inconceivable beauty, strength,wealth and geniality of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but directlyplease the Lord's senses through loving service and thus receive the supremebenediction of going back home, back to Godhead. The devotees return to theLord's abode, where life is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge. No demigod,family member or forefather can give one an eternal life of bliss andknowledge. However, if one foolishly neglects the lotus feet of the SupremeLord and instead accepts the temporary material body to be everything, thenone must certainly perform elaborate sacrifices, austerities and charity andfulfill all of the obligations mentioned above. Otherwise, one becomescompletely sinful and condemned, even from the material point of view.</div>

<div class="Translation"> One who has thus given up all other engagements and has taken full shelter at the lotus feet of Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is very dear to the Lord. Indeed, if such a surrendered soul accidentally commits some sinful activity, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is seated within everyone's heart, immediately takes away the reaction to such sin.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the previous verse it was clearly described that a fully surrendereddevotee of the Supreme Lord has no need to perform ordinary, worldly duties.Now in this verse it is revealed that devotional service is so pure and potentthat a surrendered devotee of the Lord has no need to perform any otherpurificatory process. As described in the Sixth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, asurrendered devotee has no need to perform präyaçcitta, or atonement for anaccidental falldown into sinful activity. Since devotional service is itself themost purifying process, a sincere devotee who has accidentally stumbled on thepath should immediately resume his pure devotional service at the lotus feet ofthe Lord. And thus the Lord will protect him, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä (9.30):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">api cet su-duräcäro</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhajate mäm ananya-bhäk</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sädhur eva sa mantavyaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">samyag vyavasito hi saù</div>
<div class="First">The word tyaktänya-bhävasya in this verse is very significant. As stated in theprevious verse, a pure devotee realizes clearly that all living entities, includingBrahmä and Çiva, are part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godheadand thus have no separate or independent existence. Realizing that everythingand everyone is part and parcel of the Lord, a devotee automatically is notinclined to commit sinful activities by violating the order of God. However,due to the powerful influence of material nature, even a sincere devotee maybe temporarily overwhelmed by illusion and deviate from the rigid path of puredevotional service. In such a case, Lord Kåñëa Himself, acting within the heart,removes such sinful activities. Even Yamaräja, the lord of death, has no powerto punish a surrendered devotee who has accidentally committed sinfulactivities. As stated here, Kåñëa is pareça, or the Supreme Lord, and allsecondary lords such as the demigods cannot threaten the Lord's personaldevotees. In his youth Ajämila had been a pious brähmaëa engaged in theservice of the Lord. Then, by bad association with a prostitute, he becamepractically the most degraded man in the world. At the end of his life,Yamaräja sent his Yamadütas to drag away the soul of the sinful Ajämila, butthe Personality of Godhead immediately sent His personal associates to saveAjämila and demonstrate to Yamaräja that no secondary personality candisturb the personal devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Asstated in Bhagavad-gétä, kaunteya pratijänéhi na me bhaktaù praëaçyati [Bg. 9.31].</div>
<div class="First">The argument may be raised that the småti-çästra states, çruti-småtimamaiväjïe: the Vedic scriptures are the direct orders of the Personality ofGodhead. Therefore, one may ask, how can the Lord tolerate that His ordersbe occasionally neglected, even by His devotees? To answer this possibleobjection, the word priyasya is used in this verse. The devotees of the Lord arevery dear to the Lord. Although the beloved child may accidentally commit anabominable activity, the loving father forgives the child, taking intoconsideration the actual good intentions of the child. Thus, although thedevotee of the Lord does not try to exploit the Lord's mercy by requesting theLord to free him from any future suffering, the Lord, by His own initiative,frees the devotee from the reactions to accidental falldowns.This causeless mercy of the Lord upon His devotee is His paramaiçvaryam,or supreme opulence. Gradually the faithful devotee becomes free, even fromaccidental falldown, because simply by remembering the lotus feet of the Lord,what to speak of by actively rendering service to Him, his heart is purified.Although the surrendered devotees of the Personality of Godhead maysometimes appear to be affected by mundane attitudes, they are inevitablyprotected by the merciful Lord and are never actually defeated in life.</div>

<div class="First">Närada Muni related to Kåñëa's father, Vasudeva, the story of theenlightenment of King Nimi. Now Närada reveals that Vasudeva himself willalso achieve the supreme perfection of life by practicing the same principlesspoken long ago by the nine Yogendras. Actually, Vasudeva was already apersonal associate of the Supreme Lord, but due to his natural humility as agreat devotee, he was determined to perfect his love of Kåñëa. Thus we canobserve the exalted status of the parents of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="First">Ordinary persons feel that the Supreme Lord is always to be worshiped asthe supreme father who supplies everything for the living entities. Such anattitude is not the perfection of love of Godhead, because when a son is younghe is incapable of giving much service to his mother and father. When thechild is very young, it is rather the parents who are constantly serving thechild. So when the devotee takes the role of mother or father of Kåñëa, there isunlimited opportunity for rendering loving service to the Lord, whom thedevotee ecstatically accepts as his son. It was Vasudeva's good fortune thatNärada Muni personally revealed to him the wonderful teachings given by thenava-yogendras long, long ago to the saintly King Nimi.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear Vasudeva, you and your good wife Devaké have manifested great transcendental love for Kåñëa, accepting Him as your son. Indeed, you are always seeing the Lord, embracing Him, speaking with Him, resting with Him, sitting together with Him and taking your meals with Him. By such affectionate and intimate association with the Lord, undoubtedly both of you have completely purified your hearts. In other words, you are already perfect.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The words ätmä väm pävitaù in this verse are very significant. Ordinaryconditioned souls are required to purify their existence by practicing theregulative principles of bhakti-yoga and learning how to offer all of theiractivities in the devotional service of the Lord. Such a regulative, gradualprocess, however, cannot be applied to those exalted souls who are personallyattending the Lord as His parents, boyfriends, girl friends, advisors, sons, etc.Due to Vasudeva and Devaké's intense love for Kåñëa as their son, they hadalready achieved the highest perfectional stage of life. Although in theprevious verse Çré Närada Muni informed Vasudeva that he and his wife hadbecome glorious by Kåñëa's taking birth as their son, Vasudeva might haveargued that other personal associates of the Lord, such as Jaya and Vijaya, hadfallen down due to offending the brähmaëa class. Therefore, in the presentverse Närada has used the word pävitaù: "You are completely purified, andtherefore you are completely free from the slightest trace of discrepancy inyour devotional service, due to your intense love for Kåñëa."It is understood from the commentary of Çréla Viçvanätha CakravartéÖhäkura that Çré Vasudeva, Kåñëa's pastime father, is actually an eternallyliberated nitya-siddha associate of the Personality of Godhead. Vasudeva has aspiritual body, just as Kåñëa does, and he is always merged in the overwhelmingecstatic desire to serve Kåñëa, his beautiful son. However, Närada couldunderstand that due to extreme humility, Vasudeva considered himself anordinary human being and was feeling very anxious to receive transcendentalinstructions on the devotional service of the Lord. Accepting the ecstatichumility of Vasudeva, and to relieve his anxiety, Çré Närada Muni instructedhim in the science of bhakti-yoga as one might instruct an ordinary humanbeing. However, at the some time Närada has revealed that actually ÇréVasudeva and Devaké are already completely glorious by their unprecedentedfortune of having Kåñëa and Balaräma as their sons. Therefore, Närada istelling Vasudeva, "My dear Vasudeva, do not in any way be discouraged ordoubtful about your position. Undoubtedly you are immediately going backhome, back to Godhead. And actually you and your good wife are the most fortunate persons."</div>
<div class="First">In conclusion, everyone should become fortunate by fully developing hisdormant love for Kåñëa. Many terrible demons who opposed Kåñëa eventuallyachieved a happy state of life by their association with Kåñëa. Therefore thereis no doubt about the supreme bliss achieved by the loving devotees of theLord who day and night can only think of pleasing Kåñëa.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Inimical kings like Çiçupäla, Pauëòraka and Çälva were always thinking about Lord Kåñëa. Even while they were lying down, sitting or engaging in other activities, they enviously meditated upon the bodily movements of the Lord, His sporting pastimes, His loving glances upon His devotees, and other attractive features displayed by the Lord. Being thus always absorbed in Kåñëa, they achieved spiritual liberation in the Lord's own abode. What then can be said of the benedictions offered to those who constantly fix their minds on Lord Kåñëa in a favorable, loving mood?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">On the eve of the disappearance of Lord Kåñëa from this world, Vasudevabecame filled with lamentation thinking that he had not properly utilized theopportunity of the Lord's personal presence to become perfectly Kåñëaconscious. However, Närada Muni assured Çré Vasudeva that the glories ofVasudeva and his good wife Devaké were chanted throughout the universebecause even the demigods worshiped the exalted status of the Lord's ownparents. Vasudeva was not only concerned about his own spiritual position, buthe also lamented for the Yadu dynasty, which had left the world in anapparently inauspicious way, being cursed by great brähmaëas such as Näradaand dying in a fratricidal war. Although the members of the Yadu dynastywere personal associates of the Lord, their disappearance from the earth wasapparently inauspicious, and therefore Vasudeva was concerned about theireventual destination. So Närada here assures Vasudeva that even the demonswho opposed Kåñëa, such as Çiçupäla, Pauëòraka and Çälva, achievedpromotion to the Lord's own abode because of their constant absorption inthinking of Kåñëa. Therefore what to speak of the exalted members of theYadu dynasty who actually loved Kåñëa more than anything (anurakta-dhiyämpunaù kim)? Similarly, it is stated in the Garuòa Puräëa,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ajïäninaù sura-varaà samadhikñipanto</div>

<div class="First">"Even foolish sinners like Çiçupäla and Duryodhana who showered abuse uponthe Lord were cleansed of all sins simply by remembering Lord Kåñëa.Somehow or other their minds were absorbed in the Lord, and thus theyattained liberation. What doubt then is there about the destination of thosewho are overwhelmed with devotional feelings for the Lord?"Vasudeva was also feeling anxiety because on the one hand he was awarethat Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but at the same time hetreated the Lord as his beloved son. In the relationship between the father andson, sometimes the father must chastise the son and restrict him in variousways. In this way Vasudeva was feeling that undoubtedly he had offended theLord in his attempt to train Lord Kåñëa as his son. However, Lord Kåñëa isactually pleased when a pure devotee becomes absorbed in parental love forHim and thus devotedly tries to care for Him just as loving parents care for asmall child. Kåñëa reciprocates the intense devotional feelings of such devoteesby actually appearing before them as a young boy and acting just like their son.As mentioned in this verse, the demons actually chastised Kåñëa withfeelings of enmity. Nevertheless, such demons attained liberation due to theirabsorption in Kåñëa. Therefore, what to speak of the destination of Vasudeva,who chastised Kåñëa due to his overwhelming parental love for Him? Theconclusion is that the devotees of the Lord should never consider Vasudevaand Devaké to be ordinary, conditioned souls. Their relationship with LordKåñëa is completely on the transcendental platform of vätsalya-rasa, orparental love for the Personality of Godhead. It has nothing to do with theparental love of the material world, which is based on a mood of sensegratification, since the parents see their children as objects of material enjoyment.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Do not think of Kåñëa as an ordinary child, because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, inexhaustible and the Soul of all beings. The Lord has concealed His inconceivable opulences and is thus outwardly appearing to be an ordinary human being.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Lord Çré Kåñëa is the original source of all plenary incarnations of theAbsolute Truth. Kåñëas tu bhagavän svayam [SB 1.3.28]. His unlimitedtranscendental opulences are inexhaustible, and thus He very easily brings theentire creation under His personal control. Lord Kåñëa is the eternalwell-wisher of every living entity, so there was no need for Vasudeva to beanxious about his future destination, nor that of the other personal associatesof Kåñëa, such as the members of the Yadu dynasty. In verse 46 of this chapter,Närada Muni told Vasudeva, putratäm agamad yad väà bhagavän éçvaro hariù:"You and your good wife are now glorified throughout the universe becauseLord Kåñëa has personally become your son." In this way Närada isencouraging Vasudeva to continue to love Kåñëa as his most beloved son, forsuch ecstatic devotional feelings are never to be given up. But at the sametime, Närada is removing Vasudeva's doubts about the future by assuring him,"Due to your love for Kåñëa you may think that He is an ordinary humanbeing. You are appearing like a human being, and Lord Kåñëa is simplyreciprocating with you. In order to encourage you to love Him as your son, Heis placing Himself under your control. And thus, His inconceivable power andopulences are being concealed from you. Don't assume, however, that there isactually a dangerous situation because of the events of this material world.Although Kåñëa appears to be under your control, He is eternally the supremecontroller. Therefore, do not consider Him to be a human being. He is always the Supreme Personality of Godhead."</div>
<div class="First">The word mäyä in this verse indicates that Kåñëa's manuñya, or humanlike,activities are actually misleading to the ordinary man because Kåñëa is theSupreme Personality of Godhead. Mäyä also means "transcendental potencies."As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, sambhavämy ätma-mäyayä: [Bg. 4.6] the Lorddescends in His own transcendental form filled with transcendental potencies.And thus the words mäyä-manuñya-bhävena here also indicate Kåñëa's originaltranscendental form, which resembles the humanlike forms experienced inthis world. Mäyä also indicates "mercy," or "compassion," according to theSanskrit dictionary, and thus the Lord's incarnation is understood to be Hiscauseless mercy upon the conditioned souls. The Lord's descent is also Hiscauseless mercy upon the liberated souls, who take immense pleasure in joiningthe Lord in His pastimes and in chanting and hearing about such exaltedspiritual activities (çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù [SB 7.5.23]).In order to reciprocate the love of Vasudeva for Him, Kåñëa mostlyconcealed His unlimited opulences. In this way the devotee is fully encouragedin his particular loving relationship with the Lord. However, when Vasudevawas filled with anxiety due to the dangerous situation created by thebrähmaëa's curse, Närada immediately reminded him that such anxiety wasunnecessary, since all these events were under the direct control of theSupreme Personality of Godhead. Thus, the Vaiñëava paramahaàsas who takethe position of the Lord's parents remain under the shelter of the Lord at alltimes and never deviate from the loving devotional service of the Lord. Theyremain fixed in transcendence in all circumstances, unlike ordinary parents ofthe material world, who are constantly becoming bewildered by illusion due to the bodily concept of life.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The Supreme Personality of Godhead descended to kill the demoniac kings who were the burden of the earth and to protect the saintly devotees.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">A doubt may arise as to how the Supreme Personality of Godhead descendsto this material world. And since He is the omnipotent creator of millions ofuniverses, why do the devotees glorify as wonderful the Lord's activities such asHis killing a witch named Pütanä by sucking out her life through her breast?Although such activities are certainly beyond the scope of ordinary humanbeings, why should they be considered wonderful when executed by theomnipotent Personality of Godhead? The answer is given in this verse by theword nirvåtyai The Lord killed the demons not because He was envious ofthem, but in order to give them spiritual liberation. Thus the causeless mercyof the Personality of Godhead in liberating both the devotees and the demonsby His inconceivable pastimes clearly distinguishes the Lord from any otherliving entity, either man or demigod. It is stated, mukti-pradätä sarveñäà viñëureva na saàçayaù: only Viñëu can give liberation beyond birth and death. ÇrélaViçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has pointed out that generally the demons areawarded impersonal liberation in the Brahman effulgence, whereas thedevotees are given the superior benediction of love of Godhead in the spiritualplanets. Thus, the Lord exhibits His causeless mercy toward all classes of livingentities, and His fame is spread throughout the universe. Because Kåñëa istranscendental, His fame is not different from His personal incarnation, so asthe Lord's fame expands, the entire universe is gradually liberated. These aresome of the unique characteristics of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Fifth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Närada Concludes His Teachings to Vasudeva."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">6. The Yadu Dynasty Retires to Prabhäsa</div>
<div class="First">This chapter describes how Brahmä and other demigods, after offeringprayers to Lord Çré Kåñëa, requested the Lord to return to His own abode andhow Uddhava, anticipating separation from the Supreme Personality ofGodhead, was very distressed and prayed to Çré Kåñëa that he might accompany Him on His return to that abode.</div>
<div class="First">Desiring to see Çré Kåñëa in His humanlike form, which enchants all theworlds, the Gandharvas, Apsaräs, Nägas, Åñis, Pitäs, Vidyädharas, Kinnarasand other demigods, all headed by Brahmä, Çiva and Indra, arrived at the cityof Dvärakä. Covering the body of Kåñëa with flower garlands from theNandana gardens of heaven, they praised Him with statements about His transcendental power and qualities.</div>
<div class="First">All living entities, beginning with Brahmä, are subordinate to Lord ÇréKåñëa. Kåñëa creates the universe by empowering His expansion Mahä-Viñëu.Although Kåñëa creates, maintains and destroys this world through Hismaterial energy, He remains transcendental to the material energy andperfectly self-satisfied. Even in the midst of His sixteen thousand queens, Lord Kåñëa is undisturbed.</div>
<div class="First">Performers of fruitive sacrifices and yogés desiring mystic powercontemplate the lotus feet of Lord Çré Kåñëa to attain their materialisticobjectives. But the most elevated devotees, who desire liberation from thebondage of material work, lovingly contemplate the Lord's lotuslike feetbecause those feet are the fire that destroys all desires for sense gratification.One cannot actually purify the mind by ordinary worship, penance and othersuch processes. One can purify the mind contaminated by sense gratificationonly through mature faith in the mode of goodness, which arises by hearingthe glories of Kåñëa. Therefore, intelligent persons situated in the varëäçramasystem serve the two kinds of holy places: the nectarean rivers of the topics ofKåñëa and the nectarean rivers flowing from the Lord's lotus feet.By incarnating within the Yadu dynasty, Kåñëa performed the highestwelfare work for the entire universe by displaying His transcendental pastimes.Simply by hearing and chanting about these pastimes, pious persons inKali-yuga can definitely cross over the ocean of material illusion. When theLord had fulfilled the purpose of His descent and the Yadu dynasty was facingimminent destruction from the brähmaëas' curse, the Lord desired to wind upHis pastimes. When Brahmä prayed to the lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa for thedeliverance of himself and all the other demigods, Çré Kåñëa revealed in Hisreply that after the destruction of the Yadu dynasty He would return to His own abode.</div>
<div class="First">Observing terrible disturbances indicating the imminent destruction of theworld, Lord Kåñëa called together the wise members of the Yadu dynasty andreminded them of the brähmaëas' curse. The Lord convinced them to go toPrabhäsa-tértha, where they could save themselves by the performance of ritualbathing, charity, and so on. The Yadus, in obedience to Kåñëa's desire, prepared to journey to Prabhäsa.</div>
<div class="First">Upon seeing and hearing the Lord's conversation with the Yadu dynasty,Uddhava approached Lord Çré Kåñëa in a secluded place, offered Him fullobeisances and, with folded hands, expressed his inability to tolerateseparation from the Lord. He begged Kåñëa to carry him to His own abode.If one tastes the nectar of Kåñëa's pastimes with his ears, one loses allhankering for other things. Persons who engage constantly in Kåñëa'sservice-while eating, sporting, sleeping, sitting, etc.-cannot tolerate separationfrom Kåñëa. They honor all kinds of remnants from Çré Kåñëa and thusconquer the Lord's illusory energy. Peaceful members of the renounced orderattain Brahmaloka after exhaustive and painful exertion, whereas the devoteesof the Lord simply discuss Lord Kåñëa among themselves, chant and rememberHis various pastimes and instructions, and thus automatically cross beyond the insurmountable material energy.</div>

<div class="First">The word durvibhävyam is significant here. The ultimate cause of thecreation, maintenance and annihilation of the material world is certainlyinconceivable even for the greatest mundane scientists, who waste their livesin useless and fruitless speculation. Yet Mahä-Viñëu, who is the secondaryexpansion of an expansion of the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, sees the entire cosmosto be like an insignificant atom. So what hope is there for foolish so-calledscientists who try to understand Kåñëa by their ridiculous experimental power?Thus the word anavadya is used. No one can find fault or discrepancy in thebody, character, activities or instructions of the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. The Lord is never materially ignorant; therefore He never exhibitscruelty, laziness, foolishness, blindness or material intoxication. Similarly,because the Lord is never polluted by material passion, He never exhibitsmaterial pride, lamentation, yearning or violence. And since the Lord is freefrom material goodness, He never attempts to peacefully enjoy the material world with a sublime materialistic mentality.</div>
<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa, as stated here (sve sukhe 'vyavahite 'bhirataù), is eternally busy,day and night, in His transcendental abode, relishing the inconceivable lovingdevotion of His innumerable associates. The Lord is being embraced and isembracing. He is joking and is hearing the joking of His loved ones. The Lordis walking through forests full of fruits and flowers, playing in the nectareanriver Yamunä and taking part in His most confidential transcendental lovingaffairs with the cowherd girls of Våndävana. These pastimes in Kåñëaloka andon other Vaikuëöha planets are eternal, faultless and an ocean of spiritualhappiness. The Lord never descends to the dry platform of relative materialhappiness. The infinite Personality of Godhead bas nothing to gain fromanyone; thus fruitive activity cannot possibly exist within the Lord.</div>

<div class="First">The conditioned living entity can purify his existence simply by havingfirm faith in the transcendental glories of the Personality of Godhead. Whatthen can be said of the extraordinary good fortune of the demigods, who weredirectly seeing Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet? Although we are presently afflicted byinnumerable material desires, these desires are temporary. The eternal livingentity is meant to experience a loving relationship with the supreme livingentity, the Personality of Godhead; and by rendering pure devotional serviceto the Lord, the heart of the living entity is completely satisfied.The word dhümaketu in this verse indicates a flaming comet or fire, whichrepresents Lord Çiva. Lord Çiva is the master of the mode of ignorance, andLord Kåñëa's lotus feet are compared to the comet, a symbol of the potency ofÇiva, which can destroy all ignorance within the heart. The wordsama-vibhütaye ("for achieving equal opulence") indicates that the puredevotees go back home, back to Godhead, and enjoy the infinite bliss of thespiritual world. Lord Kåñëa is endowed with unlimited opulent paraphernaliafor enjoyment, and a liberated soul who goes to Kåñëa's abode is awarded allopulence for serving the Lord. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta SarasvatéÖhäkura, the word vyühe in this verse indicates the three puruña incarnations,namely Mahä-Viñëu, Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu and Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, as wellas Väsudeva. If we can scientifically understand how Kåñëa expands Himself tocreate the material world, we shall immediately experience that everything isthe property of Kåñëa and thus become free from the desire to exploit it for ourown selfish purposes. Kåñëa is the Supreme Lord, the master of everyone andthe reservoir of all opulences, and one should remember His lotus feet in themorning, at noon and in the evening. One who always remembers Kåñëa andnever forgets Him will experience real, blissful life beyond the pale shadow of material illusion.</div>

In any case, everyone is interested in the potencyof the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The atheistic material scientists arealso fascinated by the external material potency of the Lord, and the grosssense gratifiers are attracted by the physical body, which is also ätma-mäyä, oran expansion of the Lord's potency. Although all of the Lord's potencies arequalitatively one with the Lord, and therefore with each other, the blissfulspiritual potency is nevertheless supreme because it establishes relationshipsbetween the Lord and the pure living entities on the platform of eternalhappiness. Every living entity is originally a loving servitor of the Lord, andthe spiritual energy of the Lord engages the living entity in his pure constitutional position beyond illusion.</div>
<div class="First">Our dreaming and waking experiences are both activities of the mind;however, the activities we perform while awake are more valuable because theyestablish us in our permanent situation. Similarly, at every moment everyliving entity is experiencing one of the innumerable potencies of the SupremeLord. However, the experience of the spiritual potency is more significantbecause it establishes the living entity in his eternal, constitutional position as a faithful servitor of the Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="First">The demigods are glorifying the Lord's lotus feet because they arepersonally very eager to be purified by contact with those feet (taväìghrirasmäkam açubhäçaya-dhümaketuù syät).

Lord Kåñëa is conquered by the love of His pure devotees,just as a father is easily conquered by the most insignificant gift offered by hisloving child. Unless a transcendentalist completely gives up the impersonalconception of life, he cannot make such a loving offering to the Lord. Theprocess of meditation upon the Supersoul within the heart, called dhyäna-yoga,is not as pleasing to Kåñëa as bhakti-yoga, or devotional service, because indhyäna, or meditation, the yogé is trying to satisfy himself (and not the Lord)by attaining mystic powers. Similarly, in order to acquire material benefitsfrom the Lord, ordinary people worship God in temples, churches andmosques. But one who desires actual spiritual perfection must be enlivened toalways chant and hear the glories of the Lord. Such devotional enthusiasm ismotivated by love of Godhead and is devoid of any selfish expectation.The Lord is so kind that He neglects His own eternal consort, Lakñmé, andgives preference to His humble devotee, just as a man will neglect the lovingembrace of his wife when his affectionate child approaches him with a gift.Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has pointed out that any garland worn by the Lord cannotbe faded because all of the Lord's personal paraphernalia is completelytranscendental and spiritually opulent. Similarly, there is no possibility thatmundane jealousy could appear in the character of the goddess of fortune, whois as transcendental as Lord Kåñëa Himself. Therefore the statements of thedemigods are to be understood as humorous words inspired by intense love ofGodhead. The demigods enjoy the protection of Lakñmé and, ultimately, of theSupreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, and due to their confidence in theirloving relationship with the Lord and His consort they feel free to speak in a joking way.</div>

"In the perpetual battles between the demigods, ordevotees of the Lord, and the demons, or nondevotees, each side sometimesconquers and is sometimes apparently defeated. One may argue that all thishas nothing to do with the Personality of Godhead since it is based on nothingmore than the interaction of opposing living entities. But every living entity is,however, strictly under the control of the Personality of Godhead, and victoryand defeat are always in the hands of the Lord." This does not contradict thefact of the living entity's free will, since the Lord awards victory and defeataccording to the merit of the living entities. In a legal battle neither theprosecution nor the defense can act independently of the legal system presidedover by the authorized judge. Victory and defeat in the court are awarded bythe judge, but the judge is acting according to the laws, which do not favor or discriminate against either side.</div>
<div class="First">Similarly, the Personality of Godhead is awarding us the results of ourprevious activities. In order to discredit God, materialists frequently give theargument that oftentimes innocent people suffer whereas impious rogues enjoylife unimpeded. The fact is, however, that the Personality of Godhead is not afool, as are the materialistic persons who place such arguments. The Lord cansee our many previous lives; therefore He may allow one to enjoy or suffer inthis life not only as a result of one's present activities, but also as a result ofone's previous activities. For example, by working very hard a man mayaccumulate a fortune. If such a newly rich man then gives up his work andtakes to a degenerate life, his fortune does not immediately disappear. On theother hand, one who is destined to become rich may now be working veryhard, with discipline and austerity, and yet be without spending money. So asuperficial observer might well be confused upon seeing the moral,hard-working man without funds and the degenerate, lazy man in possession ofriches. Similarly, a materialistic fool without knowledge of past, present andfuture is unable to understand the perfect justice of the Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="First">The example given in this verse to explain Kåñëa's controlling power isappropriate. Although a bull is extremely powerful, he is easily controlled by aslight tug on a rope strung through his pierced nose. Similarly, even the mostpowerful politicians, scholars, demigods, etc., may immediately be put into anunbearable situation by the omnipotent Personality of Godhead. Therefore thedemigods have not come to Dvärakä to proudly display their universal politicaland intellectual powers but to humbly surrender at the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead.</div>

Although we can perceive the long-term resultsof this aging process, we cannot experience the process itself. For example, noone can feel how his hair or fingernails are growing. We perceive thecumulative result of their growth, but from moment to moment we cannotexperience it. Similarly, a house gradually decays until it is demolished. Frommoment to moment we cannot perceive exactly how this is happening, but inthe course of longer intervals of time we can actually see the deterioration ofthe house. In other words, we can experience the results or manifestations ofaging and deterioration, but as it is taking place the process itself isimperceptible. This is the wonderful potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form of time.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My Lord, You are living with sixteen thousand exquisitely beautiful, aristocratic wives. By their irresistible coy and smiling glances and by their lovely arching eyebrows, they send You messages of eager conjugal love. But they are completely unable to disturb the mind and senses of Your Lordship.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the previous verse it was clearly stated that no material object can attractthe senses of the Lord. Now in this verse it is demonstrated that the Lord hasno desire to enjoy even spiritual sense gratification. Kåñëa is complete inHimself. He is the reservoir of all pleasure, and He does not lust after anythingmaterial or spiritual. The argument may by given that Kåñëa, in order to pleaseHis wife Satyabhämä, stole a pärijäta flower from heaven and thus appeared tobe a henpecked husband under the control of His loving wife. But althoughKåñëa is sometimes conquered by the love of His devotees, He is neverinfluenced by the desire to enjoy like an ordinary, lusty materialistic person.The nondevotees cannot understand the overwhelming loving feelingsexchanged between the Lord and His pure devotees. Kåñëa may be conqueredby our intense love for Him, and thus pure devotees can control the Lord. Forexample, the elderly gopés in Våndävana would clap their hands in differentrhythms to make Kåñëa dance, and in Dvärakä Satyabhämä ordered Kåñëa tobring her a flower as proof of His love for her. As stated in Çréniväsa Äcärya'ssong to the six Gosvämés, gopé-bhäva-rasämåtäbdhi-laharé-kallola-magnaumuhuù: the love between the Lord and His pure devotee is an ocean ofspiritual bliss. But at the same time, Kåñëa remains completely self-satisfied.Kåñëa indifferently gave up the company of the incomparable young damselsof Vraja-bhümi, the gopés, and went to Mathurä at the request of His uncle,Akrüra. Thus neither the gopés of Våndävana nor the queens of Dvärakä couldarouse an enjoying spirit in Kåñëa. When all is said and done, pleasure in thisworld means sex. But this mundane sexual attraction is simply a pervertedreflection of the transcendental loving affairs between Kåñëa and His eternalassociates in the spiritual world. The gopés of Våndävana are unsophisticatedvillage girls, whereas the queens in Dvärakä are aristocratic young ladies. Butboth the gopés and the queens are overwhelmed with love for Kåñëa. As theSupreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa displays the highest perfection ofbeauty, strength, wealth, fame, knowledge and renunciation and is thuscompletely satisfied by His own supreme position. He reciprocates spiritualloving affairs with the gopés and queens simply for their sake. Only fools thinkthat Lord Kåñëa could be attracted by the perverted illusory pleasures to whichwe poor conditioned souls are so blindly attached. Therefore everyone shouldrecognize the supreme transcendental position of the Personality of Godheadand surrender to Him. That is the clear implication of this statement by the demigods.</div>

<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura states, änuçravaà guror uccäraëamanuçrüyante: "One should hear about Kåñëa by hearing from the spiritualmaster." The bona fide spiritual master describes the pastimes, potencies andincarnations of the Personality of Godhead to his disciple. If the spiritualmaster is bona fide and if the disciple is sincere and obedient, then thecommunication between guru and disciple is just like nectar, both for the guruand the disciple. Ordinary persons cannot even imagine the special pleasureexperienced by the devotees of the Lord. Such nectarean speaking and hearingdestroys all contamination within the heart of a conditioned soul, the primarycontamination being the desire to live without serving Kåñëa.The other nectar described here is caraëämåta, the nectarean waters thatbathe the Lord's feet. Lord Vämanadeva bathed His own lotus foot by kicking ahole in the universal covering so that the sacred Ganges water washed His toesand fell into the universe. The Yamunä River also washed Kåñëa's lotus feetwhen the Lord appeared on this planet five thousand years ago. Kåñëa sporteddaily with His boyfriends and girl friends in the Yamunä River, andconsequently that river is also caraëämåta. One should therefore try to take bath in the Ganges or Yamunä.</div>
<div class="First">Every morning in ISKCON temples, the lotus feet of the Deity of Kåñëa arebathed, and the water thus sanctified is also called caraëämåta, the nectar ofKåñëa's lotus feet. Çréla Prabhupäda taught his disciples and followers to comebefore the Deities each morning and drink three drops of the caraëämåta from the Deities' bathing.</div>
<div class="First">In all these ways one can purify his heart and relish spiritual bliss. Whenone is fixed on the platform of spiritual bliss, then one does not take anotherbirth in the material world. In this verse the word çuci-ñadaù is significant: onemust engage in the purified activities of Kåñëa consciousness. One must learnto serve the Lord from the bona fide spiritual master, whose instructions oneshould accept without speculation. Those who are attached to thephantasmagoria of this world sometimes concoct their own whimsical conceptsof God. But only from the bona fide spiritual master can we get perfect andpure knowledge about the Supreme Personality of Godhead and devotionalservice to Him. Such knowledge may be found in all the books of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda.</div>

<div class="First">Unfortunately, in Kali-yuga many persons are not attracted to theauthorized Vedic literatures. Minimizing the transcendental process of hearingand chanting the glories of the Personality of Godhead, they prefer to listen touseless and whimsical vibrations on the radio and television, in newspapersand magazines, and so on. Rather than hear about Kåñëa from the bona fidespiritual master, they endlessly give their own opinions about everything, untilthey are dragged away by the force of time. After studying the temporary,limited forms of the material world, they impatiently conclude that theAbsolute Truth is formless. Such persons are actually worshiping Kåñëa'sillusory energy, mäyä, who has been authorized to kick their stubborn heads. Ifinstead people hear directly about Kåñëa from the bona fide sources, they willvery easily solve all the problems of their lives. In Kali-yuga people areconstantly suffering from many psychological, social, economic, historical,political and existential problems. But all these nightmarish problems can beremoved as soon as one awakens to the transcendental reality of thePersonality of Godhead, who is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge and beyondthe bewildering manifestations of the material energy. The Lord appearswithin this universe so that people can observe, hear about and glorify Hisactual activities. In this difficult age of Kali we should all seriously take advantage of this opportunity.</div>

<div class="First">Just as a tidal wave overwhelms the boundary of the shore and wreakshavoc on innocent people, similarly, there was imminent danger that thepowerful Yadu dynasty might expand beyond all boundaries of social andpolitical control. The members of the Yadu dynasty had become proud becauseof their apparent familial relationship with the Personality of Godhead.Although they were very religious and devoted to brahminical culture, theyhad become, as indicated by the word dåptänäm, affected by pride due to theirrelationship with Kåñëa. Furthermore, due to their intense love for Kåñëa, theywould certainly feel such intense separation after the Lord's departure to thespiritual world that they would become maddened and thus become anunbearable burden on the earth. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura haspointed out, however, that the earth herself, due to attachment for Kåñëa,would never consider Kåñëa's own family members to be anything but awelcome burden. Still, Kåñëa wanted to remove this burden. The example isgiven that for the pleasure of her husband a beautiful young wife may decorateherself with many golden ornaments. These ornaments constitute a painfulburden for the delicate wife, but although she is willing to bear this burden,the loving husband removes the ornaments for the pleasure of his wife. So theLord, desiring to apply the wisdom of "An ounce of prevention is worth apound of cure," took precautions to remove from the earth the burden of the Yadu dynasty.</div>

In other words, Dvärakä, the Lord'sabode, is manifest on the earth, and when the earthly Dvärakä is apparentlyremoved, the eternal Dvärakä in the spiritual world remains as it is. Since themembers of the Yadu dynasty are eternal associates of the Lord, there is noquestion of their destruction. Only our conditioned vision of theirmanifestation was destroyed. This is the meaning of the word näçaù.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Many demigods, coming to the earth to assist Lord Kåñëa in His pastimes,took birth within the Yadu dynasty and appeared as Lord Kåñëa's associates.When the Lord had completed His earthly pastimes He wanted to send thesedemigods back to their previous service in universal administration. Eachdemigod was to return to his respective planet. The transcendental city ofDvärakä is so auspicious that whoever dies there immediately goes back home,back to Godhead, but because the demigod members of the Yadu dynasty, inmany cases, were not yet prepared to go back to Godhead, they had to dieoutside the city of Dvärakä. Thus Lord Kåñëa, pretending to be an ordinaryliving being, said, "We are all in danger. Let us all immediately go to Prabhäsa."In this way, by His yoga-mäyä Kåñëa bewildered such demigod members of theYadu dynasty and led them away to the holy place Prabhäsa.Since Dvärakä is parama-maìgala, the most auspicious place, not even animitation of inauspiciousness can take place there. Actually, Lord Kåñëa'spastime of removing the Yadu dynasty is ultimately auspicious, but since itoutwardly appeared inauspicious, it could not take place in Dvärakä; thereforeLord Kåñëa led the Yadus away from Dvärakä. After having sent the demigodsback to their planets, Lord Kåñëa planned to return to the spiritual world,Vaikuëöha, in His original form and remain in the eternal city of Dvärakä.Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has made the following importantcomments on this verse. Prabhäsa is a famous holy place located near theVeraval railway station, within the region of Junagarah. In Chapter Thirty ofthe Eleventh Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is written that after hearing thewords of Çré Kåñëa, the Yädavas went to the mainland from the island city ofDvärakä by means of boats and then traveled to Prabhäsa in chariots. AtPrabhäsa-kñetra they drank a beverage called maireya and became engaged in amutual quarrel. A great battle ensued, and killing each other with hard stalksof cane, the members of the Yadu dynasty acted out the pastime of their own annihilation.</div>
<div class="First">Lord Çré Kåñëa, manifesting His four-armed form, sat down under a pippalatree, placing His left foot, the heel of which was colored red like the redkoka-nada lotus, upon His right thigh. A hunter named Jarä, watching fromthe shore of the ocean at Prabhäsa, mistook the Lord's red-colored foot to be the face of a deer and shot his arrow at it.</div>
<div class="First">At the base of that same pippala tree under which Lord Kåñëa had sat thereis now a temple. One mile away from the tree, on the seashore, is theVéra-prabhaïjana Maöha, and it is said that from this point the hunter Jarä fired his arrow.</div>
<div class="First">In the conclusion to his work Mahäbhärata-tätparya-nirëaya, ÇréMadhväcärya-päda has written the following purport to the mauñala-lélä. TheSupreme Personality of Godhead, in order to bewilder the demons and ensurethat the word of His own devotees and of the brähmaëas be maintained,created a body of material energy into which the arrow was shot. But theLord's actual four-armed form was never touched by the arrow of Jarä, who isactually the Lord's devotee Bhågu Åñi. In a previous age Bhågu Muni hadplaced his foot on the chest of Lord Viñëu. In order to counteract the offenseof improperly placing his foot on the Lord's chest, Bhågu had to take birth as adegraded hunter. But even though a great devotee willingly accepts such a lowbirth, the Personality of Godhead cannot tolerate seeing His devotee in such afallen condition. Thus the Personality of Godhead arranged that at the end ofDväpara-yuga, when the Lord was winding up His manifest pastimes, Hisdevotee Bhågu, in the form of the hunter Jarä, would cast the arrow into amaterial body created by the Lord's illusory energy. Thus the hunter wouldbecome remorseful, gain release from his degraded birth and go back to Vaikuëöha-loka.</div>
<div class="First">Therefore, to please His devotee Bhågu and to confuse the demons, theSupreme Lord manifested His mauñala-lélä at Prabhäsa, but it should beunderstood that this is an illusory pastime. The Personality of Godhead, LordKåñëa, from His very appearance on the earth, did not manifest any of thematerial qualities of ordinary human beings. The Lord did not appear from thewomb of His mother. Rather, by His inconceivable power He descended intothe maternity room. At the time of His giving up this mortal world, Hesimilarly manifested an illusory situation for the sake of bewildering thedemons. To bewilder the nondevotees, the Lord created an illusory body out ofHis material energy while simultaneously remaining personally in His ownsac-cid-änanda body, and thus He manifested the downfall of an illusory,material form. This pretense effectively bewilders foolish demons, but Lord ÇréKåñëa's actual transcendental, eternal body of bliss never experiences death.Also at Prabhäsa-kñetra there is the holy place known as Bhågu-tértha,which was manifested by Lord Paraçuräma. The place at which the two riversSarasvaté and Hiraëyä flow together into the ocean is named Bhågu-tértha, andthere the hunter cast his arrow. There is an elaborate description ofPrabhäsa-tértha in the Prabhäsa-khaëòa of the Skanda Puräëa. There are alsomany phala-çrutis given within the Mahäbhärata in connection withPrabhäsa-tértha. Phala-çrutis are scriptural statements that promise variousauspicious results for one who performs a particular pious activity. In thefollowing verses the Lord Himself will explain the particular benefits to bederived from visiting Prabhäsakñetra and performing religious activities there.</div>

You are the supreme controller and the master of all mystic power. But although You are fully capable of counteracting the brähmaëas' curse against Your dynasty, You are not doing so, and Your disappearance is imminent.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">As previously mentioned, Kåñëa's own dynasty can never be destroyed;therefore the word saàhåtya means that Kåñëa was taking the Yädavas withHim as He left this material world. However, in the eyes of ordinary,unenlightened persons the withdrawal of the Yadu dynasty appears to be itsdestruction. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has very nicely explained the statement of Uddhava as follows.</div>
<div class="First">Kåñëa is addressed as deva-deva, or the supreme God among the gods,because He expertly solved all of the problems of the demigods by Hisincarnation within the universe. The Lord rid the world of demons and firmlyestablished both His devotees and religious principles. Lord Kåñëa is addressedhere as yogeça because He not only performed work on behalf of the demigods,but also revealed His beautiful, transcendental form, full of transcendentalqualities and ecstasies, for the pleasure of His pure devotees. Kåñëa is calledpuëya-çravaëa-kértana because when by His internal mystic potency Heexhibited His humanlike activities, the Lord stimulated the writing ofinnumerable Vedic scriptures about His pastimes. Thus persons who would beborn in the future, like ourselves would be able to hear and chant about theLord's activities and also go back home, back to Godhead.Having insured the transcendental bliss and liberation of all of Hisdevotees, even those who would be born in the future, Kåñëa decided the timehad come for Him to leave this material universe. Uddhava could understandthe Lord's desire and said to Kåñëa, "You have instructed the Yädavas tocounteract the brähmaëas' curse by taking bath at Prabhäsakñetra, but howcould mere bathing in a holy place be of greater value than seeing You, thePersonality of Godhead, face to face? Since the Yädavas are always seeing Yourtranscendental form, and since You are the Supreme Lord, what is the use oftheir taking bath in a so-called holy place? Therefore You obviously have someother purpose. If You actually wanted to counteract the curse, You couldsimply say, 'Let this curse not act,' and the curse would immediately beneutralized. Therefore You must be preparing to leave this universe, and that is why You have not counteracted the curse."</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Uddhava understood that Kåñëa was going to withdraw the Yadu dynasty,and thus he begged the Lord to take him along to the Lord's abode. He had nodesire to merge into Kåñëa's impersonal effulgence; instead he wanted to go tothe Lord's spiritual abode and continue associating with Kåñëa as His dearmostfriend. Kåñëa is the Personality of Godhead and can do whatever He likes, butthe devotee begs the Lord for the chance to serve Him. Although the Lordmanifests within the material world His various abodes, such as Våndävana,Dvärakä and Mathurä, and although these are certainly nondifferent fromtheir counterparts in the spiritual world, the most advanced devotees,overwhelmed with desire to personally serve the Lord, are very eager to go tothe Lord's original spiritual planet. As stated by Lord Kapila in the ThirdCanto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, the pure devotees have no desire for liberation.Because of their eagerness to render service, they urge the Lord to appearbefore them. The six Gosvämés, due to their intense eagerness to serve Rädhäand Kåñëa, urgently searched after Them, calling out Their names in theforests of Våndävana. Similarly, Uddhava is urging the Lord to take him to Hisown abode so that Uddhava's personal service to the Lord's lotus feet will not be interrupted even for a moment.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has pointed out that immatureconditioned souls think that Lord Kåñëa is an ordinary jéva soul engaged inmaterial activities and was thus unable to protect His own dynasty from thecurse of the brähmaëas. Uddhava's statement corrects such unfortunatepersons. It is Lord Kåñëa Himself who awarded pious living entities birth inbrahminical families, and then Lord Kåñëa further awarded them the potencyto curse His dynasty. And finally, Lord Kåñëa personally kept the curse intact,although He was capable of neutralizing it. Therefore in the beginning, middleand end, directly and indirectly, in the past, present and future, Lord Kåñëa isthe Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He iscompletely transcendental to even the slightest touch of material illusion or impotence.</div>

By hearingabout Kåñëa and by serving Him, we can give up the illusion of trying to enjoysomething separately from the Supreme Lord. If we neglect such hearing andserving, our minds will become bewildered by the illusory energy of the Lord,and seeing the world as separate from Kåñëa, we will take it as a place meantfor our own sense gratification.

He ispraying to the Lord because he cannot bear the thought of living withoutKåñëa even for a moment. This feeling is called love of God. Uddhava isaddressing the Lord as follows: "Even if Your illusory energy tries to attack us,my Lord, we will very easily conquer her by our powerful weapons, which arethe remnants of Your foodstuffs, clothes, ornaments, and so on. In otherwords, we will easily conquer over mäyä by kåñëa-prasädam, and not by useless speculation and mental concoction."</div>

<div class="First">In Chapter Twelve of Bhagavad-gétä it is stated, kleço 'dhikataras teñämavyaktäsakta-cetasäm: those who are attached to the impersonal feature of thePersonality of Godhead must endure grueling penances in order to achieveimpersonal liberation in the realm of Brahman. Also it is stated in theBhägavatam, äruhya kåcchreëa paraà padaà tataù/ patanty adho'nädåta-yuñmad-aìghrayaù [SB 10.2.32]. Kåcchreëa: with great struggle andtrouble the yogés climb their way up into the impersonal effulgence calledbrahmajyoti, but again they slip out of the jyoti and fall back into the materialworld because they do not take shelter of the Personality of Godhead.Envious fools object to the "paternalism" of the Personality of Godhead, butthese fools cannot take credit for the creation of their own body, brain orenergy, nor can they claim credit for the air, rain, vegetables, fruits, sun, moon,and so on. In other words, they are totally dependent on the mercy of God atevery second, and yet they arrogantly state that they do not want to accept theshelter of the Lord, because they are self-sufficient. In fact, some bewilderedliving entities even think that they themselves are God, although they cannotexplain why "God" has to struggle and toil to achieve meager success in theyoga system. Therefore Uddhava is pointing out that, unlike the impersonalistsand meditators, the pure devotees very easily cross over the illusory energybecause they are totally attached to the lotus feet of Kåñëa. Lord Kåñëa isalways transcendental, and if one is firmly attached to the Lord's lotus feet,then he is also transcendental. The causeless mercy of Kåñëa is more valuablethan millions and billions of years of one's own struggling and straining. Oneshould try to get the Lord's mercy, and then everything will become very easyon the path of spiritual realization. In this age one can achieve the mercy ofLord Kåñëa by constantly chanting His holy name, as recommended in the çästra:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">harer näma harer näma</div>

<div class="First">If one constantly chants Lord Kåñëa's holy names, avoiding offenses againstthe names, then surely one will achieve the same result as Uddhava. Uddhavawas not interested in so-called Brahman realization, but rather he wanted to goon drinking the maddening nectar of the beautiful smiling of the Lord's moonlike face.</div>

We ecstatically recall Your amorous pastimes with Your confidential conjugal devotees and how You boldly smile and move about while engaged in such youthful pastimes.

<div class="First">In this verse Uddhava, by stating bhramantaù karma-vartmasu, humblypresents himself as one of the conditioned souls entangled in fruitiveactivities. Still, Uddhava is confident that he will certainly cross over theillusory energy because he is addicted to chanting and remembering theglorious activities and words of Lord Kåñëa.

Uddhava states here that hearingand chanting the holy name and pastimes of Kåñëa is infinitely more effectivethan becoming a naked yogé in the forest and running the constant risk ofbecoming, due to lusty desires and sex indulgence, a naked monkey in theforest. Uddhava is begging the Lord for the mercy of His Sudarçana cakra,whose effulgence is represented by the process of remembering and chantingthe pastimes of the Lord. One who absorbs himself in the incomparable bliss ofthinking of the Lord's abode easily becomes free from all lamentation, illusion and fear. That is the recommendation of Çré Uddhava.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté, the conditioned livingentities, by their movements, laughter, activities and words, simply bindthemselves more and more in material existence. But if they engage in hearingand chanting about the pastimes of the Personality of Godhead, theconditioned souls will achieve liberation from the bondage of repeated birthand death. This process of supreme liberation will now be elaborately describedby Lord Çré Kåñëa to His dearmost devotee Çré Uddhava.Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Sixth Chapter, of theÇrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Yadu Dynasty Retires to Prabhäsa."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">7. Lord Kåñëa Instructs Uddhava</div>
<div class="First">As described in this chapter, the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, replied toUddhava's prayerful entreaty that he be allowed to return with Him to Hisabode. Kåñëa advised Uddhava to take to the renounced order of sannyäsa,and when Uddhava showed interest in more elaborate instructions, the Lordfurther described the avadhüta's account of his twenty-eight spiritual masters.After hearing Uddhava's prayerful request to be taken back with Him tothe spiritual world, Lord Kåñëa informed him that He was indeed desirous ofreturning to His own personal abode because the purpose of His descent hadbeen successfully fulfilled and the misfortunes of Kali-yuga would soon besetthe earth. He thus advised Uddhava to take up sannyäsa by fixing his mindupon Him and establishing himself in theoretical and realized transcendentalknowledge. The Lord further instructed Uddhava that while remaininguntouched by contamination and compassionately disposed to all beings, heshould begin wandering throughout this temporary world, which is simply thecombined manifestation of the Lord's illusory energy and the imagination of the living entities.</div>
<div class="First">Uddhava then stated that renouncing material things in a spirit ofdetachment is the source of the highest auspiciousness, but such renunciationis certainly extremely difficult to accomplish for living entities other than thedevotees of the Supreme Lord, because they are very attached to sensegratification. Uddhava expressed the need for some instruction by whichfoolish persons who misidentify the body as the self can be convinced to carryout their duties in accordance with the order of the Supreme Lord. Even greatdemigods like Brahmä are not completely surrendered to the Lord, butUddhava declared that he himself had taken shelter of the only true instructorof the Absolute Truth-Lord Näräyaëa, the all-perfect, all-knowing master ofVaikuëöha and the only real friend of all living entities. Hearing this, theSupreme Lord replied that actually the jéva soul is his own guru. Within thishuman body, the living beings can search out the Supreme Lord by positiveand negative means and ultimately achieve Him. For this reason the humanform of life is most dear to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this regard,Lord Kåñëa began to describe an ancient conversation between a brähmaëa avadhüta and the great king Yadu.</div>
<div class="First">The son of Yayäti, Mahäräja Yadu, once encountered an avadhüta who wastraveling about, here and there, in great transcendental ecstasy and was actingunpredictably, just like someone who has become haunted by a ghost. TheKing inquired from the holy man about the cause of his wandering and hisecstatic condition, and the avadhüta replied that he had received variousinstructions from twenty-four different gurus-the earth, the wind, the sky, thewater, fire, and so on. Because of the knowledge he had gained from them, hewas able to travel about the earth in a liberated state.From the earth he had learned how to be sober, and from the twomanifestations of earth, namely the mountain and the tree, he had learned,respectively, how to serve others and how to dedicate one's whole life to thebenefit of others. From the wind, manifesting in the form of the vital airwithin the body, he had learned how to be satisfied with merely keepingoneself alive, and from the external wind he had learned how to remainuncontaminated by the body and the objects of the senses. From the sky hehad learned how the soul, which pervades all material substances, is bothindivisible and imperceptible, and from the water he had learned how to benaturally clear and purifying. From the fire he had learned how to devour allthings without becoming dirtied and how to destroy all the inauspicious desiresof those who make offerings to him. He had also learned from fire how thespirit soul enters into every body and gives illumination and how the birth anddeath of those who are embodied cannot be discerned. From the moon he hadlearned how the material body undergoes growth and dwindling. From the sunhe had learned how to avoid entanglement even while coming into contactwith sense objects, and he had also learned about the two different modes ofperception based on seeing the real form of the soul and seeing falsedesignative coverings. From the pigeon he had learned how too much affectionand excessive attachment are not good for one. This human body is the opendoor to liberation, but if one becomes attached to family life like the pigeon,one is compared to a person who has climbed up to a high place just to fall down again.</div>

The Personality of Godhead isthe reservoir and root of all existence, and the material world is just a dimreflection of the brilliant scenery of His eternal, spiritual abode, whereeverything is infinitely beautiful and pleasurable. Viñëu is the supreme reality,and no living entity can ever be equal to or greater than Him. The Lord existswithin His own unique category called viñëu-tattva, or the Supreme Personalityof Godhead. All other prominent or extraordinary living entities owe theirpositions and potencies to the Lord. Ultimately Viñëu Himself is a plenaryexpansion of Lord Kåñëa, the original source of all the viñëu-tattva andjéva-tattva expansions. Thus Lord Kåñëa is the basis of everything.</div>

<div class="First">In this and the following verses, Lord Kåñëa indicates to Uddhava that heshould immediately fix himself in self-realization by giving up all identificationwith the material world. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has pointed out that the Yadudynasty was not actually destroyed by Lord Kåñëa but merely removed fromthe vision of the world through the curse of the brähmaëas; similarly, theLord's eternal abode Dvärakä can never be drowned by the ocean.Nevertheless, all external approaches to this transcendental city were coveredby the ocean, and thus the Lord's abode remains inaccessible to foolish personsin Kali-yuga, as will be described later in this canto.By the Lord's mystic potency, called yoga-mäyä, He reveals His own form,abode, paraphernalia, pastimes, entourage, and so on, and at the suitable timeHe removes all of these from our mundane sight. Although bewilderedconditioned souls may doubt the spiritual potency of the Lord, the puredevotees can directly perceive and relish His transcendental appearance anddisappearance, which are described in Bhagavad-gétä as janma karma ca medivyam [Bg. 4.9]. If one faithfully accepts this perfect knowledge of the Lord'stranscendental nature, then surely one will go back home, back to Godhead, and become an eternal companion of Lord Kåñëa.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa's plan was to bring Uddhava back to His own eternal abodeafter a brief delay. Because of Uddhava's extraordinary spiritual qualities, theLord wanted to engage him in propagating His message among other saintlypersons who were not yet advanced to the stage of pure devotional service.However, the Lord assured Uddhava that he would not be bereft of the Lord'sassociation for even a moment. Also, because Uddhava had become a perfectmaster of his senses, he would never be afflicted by the three modes of materialnature. In this way, before bringing Uddhava back home, back to Godhead,the Lord empowered him to carry out a specific confidential mission.Wherever the supreme position of the Personality of Godhead is notrecognized, useless mental speculation becomes very prominent, and the safeand sure path of hearing perfect Vedic knowledge becomes covered by thechaos of mental concoction. At the present time, especially in the Westerncountries, literally millions of books are being published on hundreds andthousands of subjects; yet despite this proliferation of mental concoctionpeople remain totally in ignorance about the most fundamental issues ofhuman life, namely, Who am I? Where have I come from? Where am I going? What is my soul? What is God?</div>
<div class="First">The Personality of Godhead, Lord Çré Kåñëa, is the reservoir ofinnumerable enchanting pastimes, and thus He is the source of innumerablevarieties of pleasure. In fact, He is the ocean of eternal pleasure. When theeternal soul is bereft of the constitutional pleasure that comes from lovingservice to the Lord, he is overwhelmed and bewildered by material nature. Hehelplessly chases after material sense gratification, thinking that one materialobject is good and another bad, and constantly changes his assessment of whatis good and what is bad. Thus he derives no peace or pleasure, is in constantanxiety and is repeatedly thrashed by the cruel laws of nature in the form of birth, death, old age and disease.</div>
<div class="First">In this way the conditioned soul becomes a fit candidate to take birth inKali-yuga, which is the epitome of misfortune. In Kali-yuga the living entities,who are already suffering so many tribulations, mercilessly turn against oneanother. Human society in Kali-yuga becomes savagely violent, and men openslaughterhouses to butcher hundreds of millions of innocent creatures.Large-scale wars are declared, and millions of human beings, even women and children, are quickly annihilated.</div>
<div class="First">Unless the living entity recognizes the authority of the Personality ofGodhead, he remains a helpless victim in the clutches of mäyä, or materialillusion. He concocts different solutions to release himself from mäyä, butthese solutions are themselves creations of mäyä and thus cannot possiblyrelease the conditioned soul. In fact, they only intensify his distress. In thenext verse, Lord Kåñëa specifically warns Uddhava to avoid Kali-yuga and goback home, back to Godhead. Those of us who have already taken birth inKali-yuga should also heed this advice and immediately take all necessary stepsto go back to the Lord's eternal abode for a blissful life of perfect knowledge.The material world is never a happy place, especially during the fearful days of Kali-yuga.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In this age of Kali, human beings are totally unaware that the SupremePersonality of Godhead comes personally to the earth to manifest Histranscendental pastimes as they are enacted in the spiritual world. Heedless ofthe authority of the Personality of Godhead, the fallen souls of Kali-yugabecome engulfed in bitter quarrel and cruelly harass one another. Becausepeople in Kali-yuga are addicted to polluted, sinful activities, they are alwaysangry, lusty and frustrated. In Kali-yuga the devotees of the Personality ofGodhead, who are engaged in the ever-increasing loving service of the Lord,should never be attracted to living on the earth, the population of which iscovered in the darkness of ignorance and devoid of any loving relationshipwith the Lord. Thus Lord Kåñëa advised Uddhava not to remain on the earthin Kali-yuga. In fact, in Bhagavad-gétä the Lord advises all living entities thatthey should never remain anywhere within the material universe—during anyage. Therefore every living being should take advantage of the pressures ofKali-yuga to understand the overall useless nature of the material world andsurrender himself at the lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa. Following in the footsteps ofÇré Uddhava, one should surrender to Kåñëa and go back home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Now you should completely give up all attachment to your personal friends and relatives and fix your mind on Me. Thus being always conscious of Me, you should observe all things with equal vision and wander throughout the earth.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çrémad Véraräghava Äcärya has explained the concept of equal vision asfollows: sama-dåk sarvasya brahmätmakatvänusandhäna-rüpa-sama-dåñöimän."One who is on the path of self-realization should always endeavor to see theultimate spiritual nature of all existence." The word mayi in this verse meansparamätmani. One should fix one's mind on the Supreme Personality ofGodhead, who is the source of everything. Thus as one passes one's life on theearth, using up one's allotted time, one should practice seeing all things and allpeople as part and parcel of the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead.Since all living entities are part and parcel of Kåñëa, ultimately they all havethe same spiritual status. The material nature, also being an emanation ofKåñëa, has a similar spiritual status, but although matter and spirit are bothemanations from the Personality of Godhead, they do not exist exactly on thesame level. In Bhagavad-gétä it is said that the spirit soul is the superior energyof the Lord, whereas the material nature is His inferior energy. However, sinceLord Kåñëa is equally present in all things, the word sama-dåk in this verseindicates that one must ultimately see Kåñëa within everything and everythingwithin Kåñëa. Thus equal vision is compatible with mature knowledge of the varieties present within this world.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura comments as follows on this verse."At the end of His manifest pastimes on the earth, the Supreme Personality ofGodhead, Kåñëa, thought as follows within His mind: 'During My pastimes onthe earth, I have satisfied the desires of all those devotees who anxiouslydesired to see Me. I have duly married many thousands of queens, headed byRukmiëé, whom I personally kidnapped, and I have killed innumerable demonsin various places and by various means. I have attended meetings, reunionsand ceremonies with many friends, relatives and well-wishers in cities such asVåndävana, Mathurä, Dvärakä, Hastinäpura and Mithilä, and thus I have keptconstantly busy coming and going in the performance of pastimes." 'I further arranged to give My personal association to great devotees whoare situated below the earthly planet. In order to please My mother Devaké andreturn her six deceased sons who were killed by Kaàsa, I descended to theplanet Sutala and blessed My great devotee Bali Mahäräja. In order to returnthe dead son of My spiritual master, Sändépani Muni, I personally went to thecourt of Ravinandana, or Yamaräja, and thus he was able to see Me face toface. I even blessed the residents of heaven, such as mother Aditi and KaçyapaMuni, with My personal association when I traveled there to steal the pärijätaflower for My wife Satyabhämä. And in order to please the inhabitants ofMahä-Viñëu's abode, such as Nanda, Sunanda and Sudarçana, I traveled toMahä-vaikuëöhaloka to recover the deceased children of a frustratedbrähmaëa. Thus, innumerable devotees who ardently desired to see Me have received the object of their prayers.</div>
<div class="First">" 'Unfortunately Nara-Näräyaëa Åñi and the great paramahaàsa sages wholive with Him in Badarikäçrama, although most enthusiastic to see Me, neverhad their desire fulfilled. I have been on the earth for 125 years, and thescheduled time is now up. Being busily engaged in My pastimes, I did not havetime to give My blessings to these great sages. Nevertheless, Uddhava ispractically the same as Me. He is a great devotee and shares My owntranscendental opulences. Thus, he is the right person for Me to send toBadarikäçrama. I shall give Uddhava complete transcendental knowledge bywhich one becomes detached from the material world, and he in turn candeliver this knowledge, the science of transcending the kingdom of illusion, tothe worthy sages at Badarikäçrama. In this way he can teach them the methodof rendering loving devotional service to My lotus feet. Such loving devotionalservice rendered to Me is the most valuable treasure, and by hearing suchknowledge the desires of the great sages such as Nara-Näräyaëa will be completely fulfilled.</div>
<div class="First">" 'Those great souls who have surrendered unto Me are always equippedwith transcendental knowledge and detachment from the material world.Sometimes, being busy in their devotional service, they may appear to forgetMe. However, a pure devotee who has achieved the platform of love for Mewill always be protected by such sincere devotion. Even if such a devoteeshould suddenly give up his life while neglecting to fix his mind intensely onMe, such a devotee's loving feelings are so powerful that they afford him allprotection. Even if there is a temporary moment of forgetfulness, suchdevotion will bring the devotee to My lotus feet, which are beyond the visionof ordinary, materialistic persons. Uddhava is My pure devotee. Knowledge ofMe and detachment from this world have again been aroused in him because he can never give up My association.' "</div>
<div class="First">The sincere servants of Caitanya Mahäprabhu are vigorously endeavoringto spread this Kåñëa consciousness movement for the pleasure of their spiritualmaster and Lord Kåñëa. At the present time thousands of devotees in theKåñëa consciousness movement, in all parts of the world, are working longhours under difficult conditions to distribute transcendental literature andthus enlighten the general populace. In this effort the devotees have nopersonal motivation but are simply desirous of pleasing their spiritual masterby distributing his books. The people who receive this literature usually haveno previous experience of Kåñëa consciousness, yet they are so impressed bythe purity of the devotees they meet that they eagerly purchase the books andmagazines. In order to execute the tremendous task of spreading Kåñëaconsciousness, the devotees are tirelessly laboring day and night because theyare on the platform of loving devotion. Although superficially such busydevotees may occasionally not think directly of the lotus feet of Kåñëa, suchloving devotion will undoubtedly take them back to Kåñëa's lotus feet, andbeing pleased by their service, the Lord Himself will again arouse theirunflinching meditation upon His personal form. This is the beauty ofbhakti-yoga, which depends wholly and solely on the mercy of the all-mercifulPersonality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa. This is the only totally safe means ofuprooting the deep desires for material enjoyment, attaining pure love forKåñëa and going beyond the material universe to the kingdom of God. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (2.40):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nehäbhikrama-näço 'sti</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">träyate mahato bhayät</div>
<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa also advised Uddhava in this verse to give up the illusoryattachment to so-called friends and family within this material world. Onemay not be able to physically give up association with family and friends, butone should understand that everyone and everything is part and parcel of Godand is meant for the pleasure of God. As soon as one thinks, "This is mypersonal family," immediately one will see the material world as no more thana place for enjoying family life. As soon as one is attached to one's so-calledfamily, false prestige and material possessiveness arise. Actually, everyone ispart and parcel of God and therefore, on the spiritual platform, related to allother entities. This is called kåñëa-sambandha, or the constitutionalrelationship with Kåñëa. It is not possible to advance to the highest stage ofspiritual awareness and at the same time maintain a petty material concept ofsociety, friendship and love. One should experience all relationships on thehigher, spiritual platform of kåñëa-sambandha, which means seeing everythingin relation to Lord Kåñëa, the Personality of Godhead.One who is situated in his constitutional relationship with Kåñëa can see allthings in relation to Kåñëa. He thus gives up the mundane urges of the body,mind and speech and travels throughout the earth as a devotee of the Lord.Such a highly elevated personality is called gosvämé, or the master of thesenses. This stage is described in Bhagavad-gétä (18.54) by the wordsbrahma-bhütaù prasannätmä: on the spiritual platform one attains complete satisfaction.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> My dear Uddhava, the material universe that you perceive through your mind, speech, eyes, ears and other senses is an illusory creation that one imagines to be real due to the influence of mäyä. In fact, you should know that all of the objects of the material senses are temporary.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The question may be raised that since we find good and bad qualitiesthroughout the material world, how can Lord Kåñëa advise Uddhava to seeeverything equally? In this verse Kåñëa explains that material good and evil area creation of the illusory energy, just as the objects of a dream are a mental creation.</div>
<div class="First">As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, väsudevaù sarvam iti: [Bg. 7.19] Lord Kåñëa isactually everything because He is present within everything and everything ispresent within Him. Kåñëa is sarva-loka-maheçvaram [Bg. 5.29], the Lord andproprietor of all worlds. To see anything separate from Kåñëa is illusion, andattraction to any kind of material illusion, either good or bad, is ultimatelyuseless since it obliges the living entity to continue wandering in the cycle of birth and death.</div>
<div class="First">Seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and touching constitute the activities ofthe five knowledge-gathering senses. Similarly, the voice, the hands, the legs,the anus and the genital constitute the five working senses. These ten sensesare organized around the mind, which is the center of material activity. Whenthe living entity desires to exploit matter, he is covered by the three modes ofnature. Thus he concocts different philosophical, political and socialexplanations of reality but never understands the Absolute Truth, Lord Kåñëa,who is beyond the contaminated perception of the material senses. One who isentangled in the network of material designations, such as race, nationality,sectarian religion, political affiliation, etc., is absorbed in the experience ofcombining his body and other bodies with material sense objects, thinkingthese sense objects to be sources of happiness and satisfaction. Unfortunately,the entire material world, along with the senses that experience it, is atemporary creation that will be annihilated by the time potency of theSupreme Lord. Despite our foolish hopes and dreams, there is no actualhappiness on the material platform. The real truth is not material, nor is ittemporary. The real truth is called ätmä, or the eternal soul, and among alleternal souls one is supreme. He is called the Personality of Godhead, and inHis original form He is known as Kåñëa. The knowledge-gathering processculminates in perception of the inconceivable, transcendental form of Kåñëa.One who is not perceiving Kåñëa in everything and everything in Kåñëa isundoubtedly on the platform of mental concoction. In this verse Lord Kåñëawarns Uddhava to remain clear of this illusory platform of existence.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> One whose consciousness is bewildered by illusion perceives many differences in value and meaning among material objects. Thus one engages constantly on the platform of material good and evil and is bound by such conceptions. Absorbed in material duality, such a person contemplates the performance of compulsory duties, nonperformance of such duties and performance of forbidden activities.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The illusory mental platform of existence is described in this verse. Theword ayuktasya indicates the conditioned soul who does not fix his mind onthe Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is clearly described in Bhagavad-gétäand other Vedic literature that Lord Kåñëa, the Absolute Truth, is withineverything, and everything is within the Lord. The example may be given thatwhen a woman loves a man, she is most eager to see him, and she daily seeshim dressed in different clothes. Actually the woman is interested not in theclothes but in the man. Similarly, within every material object is the SupremePersonality of Godhead; therefore one who has developed love of God isconstantly seeing the Lord everywhere, and not just the superficial material objects that cover the Lord.</div>
<div class="First">The word ayuktasya in this verse indicates one who has not come to thestage of reality. Such a person, being deprived of loving devotional service toLord Kåñëa, attempts to enjoy the innumerable forms and flavors of materialexperience. This temporary, illusory engagement is not the constitutionalfunction of the bewildered living entity, who remains without any awarenessof the ultimate reality, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Within the worldof matter there are undoubtedly varieties. Among dogs there are pedigreepoodles and common mutts, and among horses there are thoroughbreds andold gray mares. Similarly, some human beings are beautiful and educated andothers are dull and homely. Some are rich and some are poor. In nature wefind fertile land and sterile land, lush forests and useless deserts, invaluablegems and colorless stones, flowing transparent rivers and stagnant dirty ponds.In human society we find happiness and distress, love and hate, victory anddefeat, war and peace, life and death, and so on. However, we do not have anypermanent relationship with any of these conditions, because we are eternalspirit souls, part and parcel of Lord Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. Vedic culture is arranged in such a way that everyone can becomeperfect in self-realization simply by performing his occupational duty for thesatisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sve sve karmaëy abhirataùsaàsiddhià labhate naraù. Some conditioned souls, however, believe thatcomplete perfection in life may be achieved by performing ordinary,nonspiritual duties on behalf of family, nation, humanity, and so on. Othersare interested in neither service to God nor noble mundane activities, andthere are others who actively pursue sinful life. Such sinful persons generallyrise from bed late in the afternoon and stay awake all night, taking intoxicantsand engaging in illicit sex. Such a dark, hellish existence is caused byattraction to tamo-guëa, the mode of ignorance. Actions in the mode ofignorance are called vikarma, as mentioned in this verse. Unfortunately,neither the materially responsible person nor the materially irresponsibleperson nor the sinful person can achieve the real perfection of life, Kåñëaconsciousness. Although different societies and different individuals maintaindifferent concepts of good and evil, all material things are ultimately useless interms of our eternal self-interest, which is Kåñëa consciousness. This idea isexpressed by the saintly King Citraketu in the Sixth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (6.17.20):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">guëa-praväha etasmin</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kaù çäpaù ko nv anugrahaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kaù svargo narakaù ko vä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kià sukhaà duùkham eva vä</div>
<div class="First">"This material world resembles the waves of a constantly flowing river.Therefore, what is a curse and what is a favor? What are the heavenly planetsand what are the hellish planets? What is actually happiness and what isactually distress? Because the waves flow constantly, none of them has aneternal effect." The argument may be given that since in the Vedas there areprescribed and forbidden activities, the Vedas also accept the concept of goodand evil within the material world. The fact is, however, that it is not theVedas themselves but the conditioned souls who are bound up in materialduality. The function of Vedic literature is to engage each individual at theparticular level on which he is presently situated and gradually elevate him tothe perfection of life. The material mode of goodness is not itself spiritual, butit does not impede spiritual life. Since the material mode of goodness purifiesone's consciousness and creates a hankering for higher knowledge, it is afavorable platform from which to pursue spiritual life, just as the airport is afavorable place from which to travel. If a man desires to travel from New Yorkto London, the New York airport is certainly the most favorable place fromwhich to travel. But if the man misses his plane, he is no closer to London thananyone in New York who did not go to the airport. In other words, theadvantage of the airport is meaningful only if one catches his plane. Similarly,the material mode of goodness is the most favorable situation from which tomove up to the spiritual platform. The Vedas prescribe and forbid variousactivities to lift the conditioned soul to the material mode of goodness, andfrom that point he should rise to the spiritual platform by transcendentalknowledge. Therefore if one does not come to the platform of Kåñëaconsciousness, his elevation to the material mode of goodness is useless, just asa trip to the airport is useless for one who misses his plane. In the Vedas thereare injunctions and prohibitions that appear to accept good and evil amongmaterial things, but the ultimate purpose of the Vedic regulations is to create afavorable situation for spiritual life. If one can immediately take to spirituallife then there is no need to waste time with rituals within the modes ofnature. Therefore Kåñëa advises Arjuna in Bhagavad-gétä (2.45),</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">trai-guëya-visayä vedä</div>

<div class="First">"The Vedas mainly deal with the subject of the three modes of material nature.Rise above these modes, O Arjuna. Be transcendental to all of them. Be freefrom all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be establishedin the Self." In this connection, Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted the following verses from Mahäbhärata:</div>

<div class="First">"Within the material world, the conditioned souls consider residence on theheavenly planets and celestial pleasures, such as the pious enjoyment ofbeautiful women, to be good and desirable things. Similarly, painful ormiserable conditions are considered to be evil or bad. However, all suchperception of good and bad in the material world is undoubtedly based uponthe fundamental mistake of considering oneself, and not the SupremePersonality of Godhead, to be the ultimate doer or performer of all actions."</div>

<div class="Translation"> Therefore, bringing all your senses under control and thus subduing the mind, you should see the entire world as situated within the self, who is expanded everywhere, and you should also see this individual self within Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The word vitatam, or "widely expanded," implies that the individual jéva soulis present throughout the material universe. Similarly, in Bhagavad-gétä (2.24)Lord Kåñëa states, nityaù sarva-gataù: the individual soul is eternal and isexpanded everywhere throughout the material and spiritual worlds. This doesnot mean, however, that each individual soul is all-pervading, but that theSupreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. has expanded His marginal potencyeverywhere. Thus, one should not blindly conclude that a minute living entityis all-pervading; rather, one should understand that God is great and expandsHis personal energy everywhere. In this verse, ätmanékñasva vitatam meansthat this material world is created to facilitate the sense gratification of theconditioned souls, who are trying to enjoy without Kåñëa, their actual master.The living entities are busily trying to exploit the external energy of the Lord,but their jurisdiction over the material world is illusory. Both the materialnature and the conditioned living being are energies of the Lord and thus existwithin the Personality of Godhead and are under His supreme control.The individual living entity exists for the pleasure of the Personality ofGodhead and is the Lord's eternal servant. As soon as the senses becomeabsorbed in material gratification they lose their power to experience theAbsolute Truth. The actual goal of sense activity is satisfaction of Viñëu, theLord, and all of the senses can experience infinite spiritual pleasure byperceiving and serving the Lord in His personal feature. Those who adopt theimpersonal conception of God, however, try to stop all sense activity. Butbecause the senses cannot remain permanently inactive they naturally returnto activities in the realm of material illusion. If one engages the senses in theservice of the Personality of Godhead, then one enjoys unlimited pleasureupon seeing the transcendental beauty of the Lord's form. But unless onequalifies himself by pure loving devotion to Kåñëa, the Lord does not awardhim this exalted experience. Therefore, every conditioned soul should end hisunnecessary separation from the Personality of Godhead by rejoining theLord's blissful company. Lord Kåñëa personally comes down to reopen theblind eyes of the conditioned souls, and thus the Lord is personally teachingUddhava so that sincere souls in the future might take advantage of Hisinstructions. Indeed, hundreds and millions of people even now derivespiritual enlightenment from Lord Kåñëa's instructions to Arjuna in Bhagavad-gétä.</div>

One who canexperience the eternal soul within everyone's body certainly becomes dear toall living beings. Since he sees everyone as qualitatively equal to himself, hedoes not envy anyone nor try to lord it over any other living being.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">One who has developed transcendental knowledge never acts whimsically.Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé describes two stages of devotional service: sädhana-bhaktiand rägänugä-bhakti. Rägänugä-bhakti is the stage of spontaneous love ofGodhead, whereas sädhana-bhakti means the conscientious practice of theregulative principles of devotional service. In most cases, one who is nowenjoying transcendental consciousness has rigidly practiced the rules andregulations of devotional service. Thus, due to previous practice, onespontaneously avoids sinful life and acts in accordance with the standards ofordinary piety. This does not mean that a self-realized soul is consciouslyavoiding sin and pursuing piety. Rather, due to his self-realized nature, hespontaneously engages in the most exalted spiritual activities, just as aninnocent child may spontaneously exhibit good qualities such as kindness,tolerance, and so on. The spiritual platform is called çuddha-sattva, or purifiedgoodness, to distinguish it from the material mode of goodness, which is alwaysto some extent polluted by the lower modes of passion and ignorance. Thus if aman in material goodness appears to be most pious in the eyes of the world, wecan only imagine the spotless character of a self-realized soul in purifiedspiritual goodness.

For my supreme benefit You have explained the procedure for giving up the material world through the process of sannyäsa, or renunciation.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The word yogeça here indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godheadawards the results of all yoga practices. Since all of the material and spiritualworlds emanate from the transcendental body of Kåñëa, there is nothing to beachieved by any yoga process except Kåñëa and His potencies. And since theLord remains eternally the master of His potencies, no one can achieveanything through yoga, or any other spiritual or material process, except by thesanction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The word yoga means"linking up," and unless we link ourselves with the Absolute Truth, we remaincovered by the darkness of ignorance. Thus, Kåñëa is the goal of yoga.In the material world we falsely try to link ourselves with the objects of thesenses. Man wants to link with woman and woman with man, or one tries tolink up with nationalism, socialism, capitalism or innumerable other creationsof the illusory energy of the Lord. Since we are linking ourselves to temporaryobjects the relationships are temporary, the results are temporary, and at thetime of death we become bewildered when all of our connections are suddenlycut off by mäyä. If we link ourselves to Kåñëa, however, our relationship withHim will continue even after death. As explained in Bhagavad-gétä, therelationship with Kåñëa that we develop in this life will continue to increase inour next life until we achieve the supreme goal of entering Kåñëa's planet.Those who sincerely serve the mission of Caitanya Mahäprabhu, following thetranscendental life-style prescribed by the Lord, will enter the Lord's abode at the end of this lifetime.</div>
<div class="First">One can never achieve a permanent situation by mental speculation, andwhat to speak of by ordinary material sense gratification. By the methods ofhaöha-yoga, karma-yoga, räja-yoga, jïäna-yoga, etc., one does not actuallyawaken his propensity for rendering eternal loving service to the Personalityof Godhead. Thus, one is bereft of the transcendental tastes of spiritualenjoyment. Sometimes the conditioned soul, disgusted by his failure to gratifyhis senses, bitterly decides to renounce the material world and merge into animpersonal, painless transcendence. But our actual happy situation is to renderloving service at the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead. All of thedifferent yoga processes gradually lead one to love of Godhead, and it is LordKåñëa's aim to reestablish the conditioned souls in this happy position.Caitanya Mahäprabhu is making this perfection easily available through thechanting of the holy name of Kåñëa, the supreme yoga process for this age.</div>

Bodily attachment causes intense pain within theheart, and we are stunned by lamentation and hankering. Çré Uddhava, a puredevotee of the Lord, here speaks like an ordinary person showing how to prayto the Personality of Godhead. We practically see that many sinful personsenter the International Society for Krishna Consciousness and afterpreliminary purification become most repentant for their previous illicitactivities. They are shocked when they realize how they gave up the personalassociation of God to pursue the useless forms created by mäyä; therefore theywholeheartedly pray to the spiritual master and Lord Kåñëa to be engagedeternally in transcendental devotional service. Such a repentant, eagermentality is most auspicious for spiritual advancement. The Lord certainlyanswers the prayers of a repentant devotee desperate to escape the clutches of illusion.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear Lord, You are the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and You reveal Yourself to Your devotees. Besides Your Lordship, I do not see anyone who can actually explain perfect knowledge to me. Such a perfect teacher is not to be found even among the demigods in heaven. Indeed, all of the demigods, headed by Lord Brahmä, are bewildered by Your illusory potency. They are conditioned souls who accept their own material bodies and bodily expansions to be the highest truth.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">All conditioned souls, from Lord Brahmä down to the insignificant ant, aredeclared by Çré Uddhava to be covered by material bodies produced by theillusory potency of the Lord. The demigods in heaven, being absorbed inuniversal management, constantly utilize their fabulous material potencies.They therefore gradually fix their minds upon their mystically empoweredbodies and also upon their bodily expansions such as their celestial wives,children, co-workers and friends. In the course of life in the heavenly planets,the demigods become conditioned to think in terms of material good and bad,and thus they accept the immediate welfare of their bodies to be the highest goal of life.</div>
<div class="First">The demigods do, however, try to strictly follow the laws of God. And tohelp them do this, the Supreme Lord descends to remind the heavenly beingsof His own supreme personality, which possesses powers infinitely exceedingtheirs. Lord Viñëu has an eternal body, full of bliss, knowledge and unlimitedvariegated potencies, whereas the demigods possess only deluxe material forms, subject to birth, death, old age and disease.</div>
<div class="First">Because the demigods are attached to ruling the created universe, theirdevotion to God is tinged with material desires. They are therefore attractedto those portions of Vedic knowledge that award the various materialopulences necessary for perpetuating their celestial life. Çré Uddhava,however, being a pure devotee of the Lord, is determined to go back home,back to Godhead, for eternal life and is thus not at all interested in thesophisticated Vedic knowledge of the demigods. The material world is agigantic prison, whose inmates are subjected to birth, death, old age andillusion, and a pure devotee has no desire to remain there even as a first-classprisoner, like the demigods. Çré Uddhava desires to return to the kingdom ofGod and for this reason directly approaches the Personality of Godhead. TheLord is sva-dåçaù, or one who reveals Himself to His devotee. Thus, only theLord Himself or His pure devotee, who faithfully repeats the Lord's message,can take one beyond the material sky into the free atmosphere of the spiritualplanets, where the liberated souls enjoy an eternal life of bliss and omniscience.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Therefore, O Lord, feeling weary of material life and tormented by its distresses, I now surrender unto You because You are the perfect master. You are the unlimited, all-knowing Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose spiritual abode in Vaikuëöha is free from all disturbances. In fact, You are known as Näräyaëa, the true friend of all living beings.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">No one can claim to be a self-made man, because everyone works with thebody and mind awarded by material nature. By the laws of nature there isalways anxiety in material existence, and terrible tragedies periodically harassthe conditioned souls. Here Uddhava points out that only Çré Kåñëa, thePersonality of Godhead, is a proper master, friend and shelter for theconditioned souls. We may be attracted by the good qualities of a particularman or demigod, but we may later discover discrepancies in that person'sbehavior. Therefore Kåñëa is described as anavadyam. There are nodiscrepancies in the personal conduct or character of the Personality of Godhead; He is eternally faultless.</div>
<div class="First">We may faithfully serve a master, father or demigod, but when it is time forus to receive our reward for faithful service, the master may die. ThereforeLord Kåñëa is here described as ananta-päram, which indicates that He is notlimited by time or space. The word anta indicates the termination of time, andpära indicates a spatial termination; therefore ananta-päram means that LordKåñëa is not limited by time or space and thus will always dutifully reward His faithful servants.</div>
<div class="First">If we serve someone other than the Personality of Godhead, our so-calledmaster may forget our service or become ungrateful. Therefore Lord Kåñëa isdescribed here as sarva-jïam, omniscient. He can never forget the service ofHis devotee, and therefore He is never ungrateful. In fact, it is said that LordKåñëa does not remember the faults of His devotees but only the sincere service they have rendered.</div>
<div class="First">A further disadvantage in serving anyone besides Kåñëa is that when we arein danger our master may not be able to protect us. If we take shelter of ournation, that nation may be destroyed in war. If we take shelter of our family,they may also die. And as described in the Vedic literature, even the demigodsare sometimes defeated by the demons. But since Lord Kåñëa is described hereas éçvara, or the supreme controller, there is no danger of His being overcomeor even impeded by any other power. Thus Lord Kåñëa's promise of protection to His devotee is eternally valid.</div>
<div class="First">If we do not serve the Personality of Godhead, we will not know theultimate result of our service. But here Lord Kåñëa is described asakuëöha-vikuëöha-dhiñëyam. Lord Kåñëa has an eternal abode calledVaikuëöha, and that abode is never disturbed by anything. The faithfulservants of Lord Kåñëa will certainly go back to Godhead, back home, for aneternal life of bliss and knowledge in the personal abode of the Lord. However,since even the demigods, and what to speak of insignificant human beings, aresubject sooner or later to annihilation, what ultimate benefit can be derived from serving them?</div>
<div class="First">Uddhava describes his personal situation as nirviëëa-dhéù andvåjinäbhitaptaù. In other words, Çré Uddhava states that he is exhausted anddiscouraged by the contradictions and anguish of material life. He has beenforced, therefore, to become humble and surrender to the lotus feet of Kåñëa,the personal friend of every living entity. In the material world a great mandoes not have time for insignificant men. But although the Lord is the greatestperson, He sits in the heart of every living entity; thus He is the most merciful.Lord Kåñëa is the ultimate shelter of even Nära, or the Lord's puruña expansionwho creates the material world. The living entity is called nara, and the sourceof his material situation is Nära, or Mahä-Viñëu. The word näräyaëa indicatesthat even Mahä-Viñëu finds His shelter in Kåñëa, who is certainly supreme.Although our consciousness is presently contaminated by sinful propensities, ifwe follow the example of Çré Uddhava and take shelter of the SupremePersonality of Godhead, Kåñëa, everything can be rectified. Taking shelter ofKåñëa means taking shelter of devotional service to Kåñëa and obeying Him.Lord Kåñëa demands this in Bhagavad-gétä, and if we comply with the order ofthe Lord our life can become fully auspicious and successful. Sooner than weexpect, we may, by Kåñëa's mercy, enter the kingdom of God for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çré Uddhava expressed to the Lord in the previous verses his fallencondition and his entanglement in the material concept of life. Now LordKåñëa reassures Uddhava that even persons far less qualified than Uddhavaare able to extricate themselves from the inauspicious life of material sensegratification. According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, even if one has not receivedthe instruction of a bona fide spiritual master, one can understand by directand indirect analysis that the material world is not a place of enjoyment.Direct analysis means one's personal experience and indirect analysis means hearing and reading of the experience of others.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, Lord Kåñëa consideredUddhava to be more intelligent than even the demigods in heaven. Uddhava,however, was feeling discouraged, thinking himself unqualified to renderdevotional service to the Lord. But Uddhava was actually perfectly situatedbecause he had achieved Lord Kåñëa as his personal spiritual master. Similarly,the members of the Kåñëa consciousness movement are guided by theinstructions of the Society's founder-äcärya, Oà Viñëupäda ParamahaàsaParivräjakäcärya Añöottara-çata Çré Çrémad A.C. Bhaktivedanta SwamiPrabhupäda. Therefore, a sincere member of the Kåñëa consciousnessmovement should never feel discouraged but should rather count his blessingsand do the needful to go back home, back to Godhead. Within the materialworld, certain activities are auspicious and produce happiness, whereas otheractivities, being sinful, are inauspicious and cause unlimited suffering. Evenone who has not yet received the complete mercy of the bona fide Kåñëaconscious spiritual master should conclude by sharp intelligence that there isno happiness in ordinary, material life and that real self-interest lies beyond the material platform.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Madhväcärya points out that even if one is expert not only in materialknowledge but also in spiritual knowledge, one will enter into the darkness ofignorance if one neglects the association of the devotees of the Lord.Therefore, one should not misinterpret this verse in a way that minimizes thesignificance of the pure devotee spiritual master. One who is vicakñaëäù, orexpert, will eventually come to understand the difference between matter andspirit. Such a person will certainly recognize and appreciate a genuine spiritualmaster. One who is advanced in knowledge undoubtedly becomes humble, andthus an expert advanced human will never neglect the lotus feet of the pure devotees of the Lord.</div>

<div class="First">Çréla Jéva Gosvämé states in this connection, gurv-anusaraëe pravartaka ityarthaù: the knowledge acquired by one's own perception and intelligence leadsone to appreciate the value of the representative of Lord Kåñëa. The wordçreyas in this verse indicates that one can advance in life through one's ownintelligence. By good association one should gradually come to understandone's eternal position as servant of Kåñëa, and then one becomes very eager tolive in the company of other enlightened persons. Birds of a feather flocktogether. The symptom of an enlightened servant of Kåñëa is that he is eagerfor the company of other such great souls. Thus by one's sensitive and rationalobservation of this material world, one should come to appreciate the value of spiritual life in the association of the devotees.</div>

"In the human form of life, the soul isfully endowed with intelligence to understand spiritual knowledge. Thus, inhuman life the soul may speak realized knowledge, see the truth, know thefuture and also understand the reality both of this world and of the next.Taking advantage of the experience of mortal life, the soul in human form mayendeavor for immortality, and the human body is fully equipped to achieve thisend. In such an elevated state the soul is certainly well acquainted with theordinary activities of animals, such as eating and drinking."The human form of life (puruñatve) is very significant because it affords usthe opportunity to perfect our existence. The Säìkhya system mentioned hereis best illustrated by the instructions of Lord Kapila to His mother, Devahüti.Lord Kapila is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and His mother</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">approached Him, saying,</div>

<div class="First">"I am very sick of the disturbance caused by my material senses, for because ofthis sense disturbance, my Lord, I have fallen into the abyss of ignorance." (SB3.25.7) Lord Kapila delivered to His mother a highly analytical summary of allmaterial and spiritual reality. It is significant that Lord Kapila did notdiscriminate against His mother because she was a woman, nor did He considerher incapable of understanding the most elaborate spiritual knowledge. Thus,in a Kåñëa conscious society of liberated souls, any man, woman or child maybecome a great devotee of Lord Kåñëa without discrimination. It is alsosignificant that in the highly intellectual Säìkhya system enunciated by LordKapila, the solid conclusion is surrender to the lotus feet of the pure devoteesand love of Godhead. In Lord Kapila's instructions in the Third Canto ofÇrémad-Bhägavatam, He emphasizes the need to take shelter of the puredevotees of the Lord. In the present verse Lord Kåñëa says,säìkhya-yoga-viçäradäù: those who are expert in taking shelter of the puredevotees and who can thus understand the actual situation of this world areable to see Kåñëa in His personal form, along with His internal and external potencies.</div>
<div class="First">A spiritual master becomes bona fide by his full surrender to his spiritualmaster; but as explained in this chapter, one may also act as his own guru. Thismeans that an intelligent and perceptive person can understand the nature ofthis world and his own limitations. Such a person then becomes very muchinclined to associate with the pure devotees of the Lord and to receive themercy of those who are advanced in Kåñëa consciousness. According to ÇrélaViçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, säìkhya-yoga, as described here, refers to therigorous intellectual progress of the jïäna-yoga system, along with the devotionof bhakti-yoga, which emphasizes the mercy of the lotus feet of the pure devotees.</div>
<div class="First">Actually, jïäna-yoga is a factor in the bhakti-yoga system, since Kåñëa isjïäna-gamya, or the goal of all knowledge. The Lord also says in Bhagavad-gétä(10.10) that He personally enlightens a sincere devotee with all knowledge. Inthis chapter, Lord Kåñëa is training Uddhava to see the Lord's personal form inthe course of his daily experiences in the material world. The Lord has alreadyindicated to Uddhava that he will travel throughout the world in samädhi, ortrance, and now Lord Kåñëa is preparing Uddhava to travel as a true sannyäsé seeing the Personality of Godhead everywhere.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the word yuktäù in thisverse indicates those engaged in the regulative practice of bhakti-yoga. Thedevotees of the Lord do not abandon their intelligence and become mindlessfanatics, as some fools think. As indicated by the words anumänataù andguëair liìgaiù, a devotee engaged in bhakti-yoga intensely searches out thePersonality of Godhead through all of the rational faculties of the humanbrain. The word mågayanti, or "searching," does not, however, indicate anunregulated or unauthorized process. If we are searching for the telephonenumber of a particular person, we look in the authorized telephone directory.Similarly, if we are searching for a particular product, we go to a specializedstore where we are likely to find what we are looking for. Çréla Jéva Gosvämépoints out that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not a product of theimagination, and thus we cannot whimsically imagine what the Lord might be.Therefore, to gain information about Lord Kåñëa, one must conduct aregulated search in the authorized Vedic scriptures. The word agrähyam in thisverse indicates that no one can achieve or understand Lord Kåñëa by ordinaryspeculation or through the activities of the material senses. In this regard ÇrélaRüpa Gosvämé states the following verse in the Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu (1.2.234):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ataù çré-kåñëa-nämädi</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na bhaved grähyam indriyaiù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sevonmukhe hi jihvädau</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">svayam eva sphuraty adaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">[Cc. Madhya 17.136]</div>
<div class="First">"No one can understand the transcendental nature of the name, form, qualityand pastimes of Çré Kåñëa through his materially contaminated senses. Onlywhen one becomes spiritually saturated by transcendental service to the Lordare the transcendental name, form, quality and pastimes of the Lord revealed to him."</div>
<div class="First">The words gåhyamäëair guëaiù indicate the rational and intellectualfaculties of the human brain. All of these can be used to directly and indirectlyperceive the Personality of Godhead. Indirectly one may experience the Lordthrough His creation. Since we are experiencing this world through ourintelligence (and senses), we may conclude that our own intelligence musthave a creator and that creator is therefore supremely intelligent. Thus,through simple logic any sane person can understand that there is a SupremePersonality of Godhead who is controlling everything.One may also directly perceive the Lord through chanting and hearing Hisholy names and glories. Çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù [SB 7.5.23] means that oneshould always chant and hear of the glories of the Lord. One who perfectlyhears and chants will undoubtedly see the Lord face to face. Lord Kåñëa isall-pervading, and one should search for Him everywhere. By thetranscendental senses, purified by bhakti-yoga, one may directly perceive theSupreme Personality of Godhead. As indicated by the word addhä in thisverse, this perception is direct and not imaginary. This point has beenelaborately explained by Çréla Prabhupäda in his purport to this verse from Çrémad-Bhägavatam (2.2.35):</div>

However, ordinary persons, even whendiscussing spiritual subject matters, generally desire to become famous or toincrease their wealth and duration of life by such spiritual practices. Mostcommon people think, for example, that the yoga system is meant forimproving one's health, that one may pray to God for money, and that one'sspiritual knowledge is meant for increasing one's prestige in society. MahäräjaYadu wants to clarify that the young brähmaëa avadhüta is not like ordinarypersons and that he is actually on a spiritual platform, as will be explained in the following verses.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Ignorant persons often think that renounced spiritual life is meant forthose who are impotent or homely or incompetent in practical worldly affairs.Sometimes foolish people say that religious life is a crutch for those who arenot expert enough to achieve a high status in society. Therefore King Yadu hasdescribed the qualities of the mendicant brähmaëa in order to show that thebrähmaëa has taken to renounced spiritual life in spite of great potential forworldly success. The avadhüta brähmaëa is described as being expert, learned,good-looking, eloquent and in every sense qualified to be a great materialsuccess. Still, the avadhüta has renounced material life and taken to Kåñëaconsciousness. Going back home, back to Godhead, for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge is the real work of a human being.</div>
<div class="First">The followers of Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu simultaneously cultivate theirown Kåñëa consciousness and strenuously endeavor in missionary work to helpothers become Kåñëa conscious. Often foolish persons deride the devotees bysaying, "Why don't you get a job?" They think that one who is sincerelyendeavoring for spiritual enlightenment and who is also enlightening others isnot doing anything practical. Foolish materialists will pay millions of dollars toextend their lives by a few weeks or months in a hospital, but they do notappreciate someone endeavoring for eternal life. There is no actual logic inmaterial life. The act of trying to enjoy without Kåñëa is in itself theculmination of irrationality, and thus we cannot expect to find anythingultimately rational or logical in a materialistic life devoid of Kåñëaconsciousness. Many devotees of Kåñëa come from wealthy, learned andinfluential families, and they take to Kåñëa consciousness in order to perfecttheir lives, and certainly not due to lack of opportunity for materialadvancement. Although sometimes persons in material distress approach theSupreme Lord for help in material life, a real devotee of Lord Kåñëavoluntarily gives up all types of material enjoyment, knowing that nothing butlove of Kåñëa and service to His lotus feet are the actual perfection of life.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The natural result of transcendental bliss is described in this verse. Theyoung brähmaëa was physically very attractive, and his senses were full ofpotency for material enjoyment, yet he was not at all affected by material lust. This position is called mukti, or liberation.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura explains that within the Gangesflow great currents of water, capable of extinguishing a blazing fire. If anelephant maddened by sex desire stands within the Ganges, its powerful,cooling currents extinguish his lust, and the elephant becomes pacified.Similarly, ordinary human beings trapped in the cycle of birth and death areconstantly harassed by the enemies of lust and greed, which never allow themind to be completely peaceful. But if, following the example of the elephant,one situates oneself within the cooling waves of transcendental bliss, then allmaterial desire will soon be extinguished, and one will become çänta, orpeaceful. As described in Sr Caitanya-caritämåta, kåñëa-bhakta niñkäma ataevaçänta [Cc. Madhya 19.149]. Thus, everyone should take to the movement ofCaitanya Mahäprabhu and cleanse himself in the cooling waters of Kåñëa consciousness, our real, eternal consciousness.</div>

<div class="First">Great mountains bear unlimited quantities of earth, which in turn givesustenance to innumerable forms of life such as trees, grass, birds, animals, andso on. Mountains also pour forth unlimited quantities of crystalline water inthe form of waterfalls and rivers, and this water gives life to all. By studyingthe example of mountains, one should learn the art of providing for thehappiness of all living entities. Similarly, one may take excellent lessons fromthe pious trees, who offer innumerable benefits, such as fruits, flowers, coolingshade and medicinal extracts. Even when a tree is suddenly cut down anddragged away, the tree does not protest but continues to give service to othersin the form of firewood. Thus, one should become the disciple of suchmagnanimous trees and learn from them the qualities of saintly conduct.According to Çréla Madhväcärya, the word parärthaikänta-sambhavaùindicates that one should dedicate all of one's wealth and other assets to thewelfare of others. By one's acquired opulence, one should especially try toplease the spiritual master and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus, thedemigods, as well as all truly respectable superior personalities, willautomatically be pleased. By developing saintly conduct, as described in thisverse, one will become tolerant, and this will free one from the uselessagitation of the material senses, which drive one to wander throughout theworld searching in vain for material happiness. Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhuhas also emphasized the tree's quality of tolerance: taror iva sahiñëunä,kértanéyaù sadä hariù [Cc. Ädi 17.31]. One who is as tolerant as a tree can chantthe holy name of Kåñëa constantly, finding ever-new satisfaction.</div>

<div class="Translation"> A learned sage should take his satisfaction in the simple maintenance of his existence and should not seek satisfaction through gratifying the material senses. In other words, one should care for the material body in such a way that one's higher knowledge is not destroyed and so that one's speech and mind are not deviated from self-realization.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">A wise man does not absorb his consciousness in the forms, flavors, aromasand sensations of material sense gratification, but rather accepts activities suchas eating and sleeping simply to keep body and soul together. One mustproperly maintain one's body by regulated activities of eating, sleeping,cleansing, etc., otherwise the mind will become weak, and one's spiritualknowledge will fade away. If one eats too austerely, or if in the name ofselflessness one accepts impure food, surely one loses control of the mind. Onthe other hand, if one eats food that is excessively fatty or rich there will be anunwanted increase in sleep and semen, and thus the mind and speech will beoverwhelmed by the modes of passion and ignorance. Lord Kåñëa hassummarized the whole matter in Bhagavad-gétä by His statementyuktähära-vihärasya yukta-ceñöasya karmasu. One should moderately andintelligently regulate all of one's bodily activities so that they are favorable forself-realization. This technique is taught by the bona fide spiritual master. Ifone is too austere or if one engages too much in sense gratification, self-realization is impossible.</div>
<div class="First">It is the duty of a devotee of the Lord to avoid seeing any object as separatefrom Kåñëa, because that is illusion. A gentleman will never try to enjoy theproperty of another gentleman. Similarly, if one sees everything in relation toKåñëa, there is no scope for material sense gratification. But if one seesmaterial objects as separate from Kåñëa, then one's material enjoyingpropensity is immediately aroused. A human being must be intelligent enoughto distinguish between preyas, or temporary gratification, and çreyas,permanent benefit. One may accept sense activity in a regulated, limitedfashion so that one will be strong for serving Kåñëa, but if one excessivelyindulges the material senses, one will lose one's gravity and seriousness inspiritual life and act like an ordinary materialist. The ultimate goal, as statedhere, is jïänam, or steady consciousness of the Absolute Truth, Lord Kåñëa.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Even a transcendentalist is surrounded by innumerable material objects, which possess good and bad qualities. However, one who has transcended material good and evil should not become entangled even when in contact with the material objects; rather, he should act like the wind.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The wind is the external manifestation of air, whereas präëa is the internalmanifestation. When the wind passes over waterfalls it carries sprinkles ofclear water and thus becomes most refreshing. Sometimes the wind blowsthrough a beautiful forest, carrying the fragrances of fruits and flowers; atother times the wind may fuel a fire that burns the same forest to ashes. Thewind, however, being fixed in its own nature, remains neutral in both itsauspicious and inauspicious activities. Similarly, within this material world wewill inevitably face both pleasing and disgusting situations. If, however, weremain fixed in Kåñëa consciousness, we will not be disturbed by theinauspicious, nor will we become attached to the materially auspicious. In thecourse of his spiritual duties, a devotee sometimes finds himself chanting HareKåñëa in a beautiful country atmosphere, and sometimes he finds himself doingthe same thing in a hellish city. In both cases the devotee fixes his mind uponLord Kåñëa and experiences transcendental bliss. Although the wind passesthrough the most dark and forbidding places, the wind is not frightened ordisturbed. Similarly, a devotee of Lord Kåñëa should never be fearful oranxious, even when in the most difficult situation. One who is attached tomaterially pleasing forms, tastes, smells, sounds and touches will also berepelled by the opposite in each category. Thus finding himself surrounded byinnumerable good and bad things, the materialist is constantly disturbed.When the wind blows in many directions at once, the atmosphere becomesagitated. Similarly, if the mind is constantly attracted and repelled by materialobjects there will be such mental disturbance that it will be impossible to thinkof the Absolute Truth. Therefore, one should learn from the blowing wind theart of moving throughout the material world without attachment.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Although we experience the wind as fragrant or foul, depending on thearomas it carries, the wind does not in fact change its actual nature. Similarly,although we regard a particular person as strong or weak, intelligent orretarded, beautiful or homely, good or bad, the pure spirit soul, who is theactual person, does not really possess any of the qualities of the body but ismerely covered by them, just as the wind is covered by different aromas. Thus,a Kåñëa conscious person is always aware that he is different from thetemporary body. He experiences the various transformations of the body, suchas childhood, adolescence, adulthood and old age; but although he experiencesthe pains, pleasures, qualities and functions of that body, a Kåñëa consciousperson never thinks that he is the body. He always understands that he is aneternal spirit soul, part and parcel of Lord Kåñëa. As stated in this verse, nayujyate yogé: he is not entangled. The conclusion is that one should neverconsider a Kåñëa conscious person in terms of bodily designation, but should see him as an eternal servitor of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> A thoughtful sage, even while living within a material body, should understand himself to be pure spirit soul. Similarly, one should see that the spirit soul enters within all forms of life, both moving and nonmoving, and that the individual souls are thus all-pervading. The sage should further observe that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as the Supersoul, is simultaneously present within all things. Both the individual soul and the Supersoul can be understood by comparing them to the nature of the sky: although the sky extends everywhere and everything rests within the sky, the sky does not mix with anything, nor can it be divided by anything.</div>

Similarly, the mighty waves of time flow constantly, like the powerful currents of a river, and imperceptibly cause the birth, growth and death of innumerable material bodies. And yet the soul, who is thus constantly forced to change his position, cannot perceive the actions of time.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The brähmaëa avadhüta instructing King Yadu again gives the example offire after having already proceeded to the example of the moon. This analyticmethod is called siàhävalokana, or "the lion's glance," by which onesimultaneously proceeds forward and casts backward glances to see if anythinghas been overlooked. Thus the sage proceeds with his analysis but returns tothe example of fire to illustrate the need for renunciation. The material bodyis certainly an ephemeral and phantasmagorical manifestation of the Lord'sexternal potency. The flames of a fire constantly take birth and disappear, yetwe perceive the fire as a continuous reality. Similarly, the soul is a continuousreality, although his material bodies appear and disappear constantly, by theinfluence of time. It is said that the most astonishing thing is that no onethinks that they will die. Because the soul is eternal, the living entity is proneto accept any fleeting situation as permanent, forgetting that his eternalnature can be truly experienced only in the eternal atmosphere of the spiritualsky. If one is convinced of this fact, he develops the quality of vairägya, or detachment from material illusion.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Just as the sun evaporates large quantities of water by its potent rays and later returns the water to the earth in the form of rain, similarly, a saintly person accepts all types of material objects with his material senses, and at the appropriate time, when the proper person has approached him to request them, he returns such material objects. Thus, both in accepting and giving up the objects of the senses, he is not entangled.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Even when reflected in various objects, the sun is never divided, nor does it merge into its reflection. Only those with dull brains would consider the sun in this way. Similarly, although the soul is reflected through different material bodies, the soul remains undivided and nonmaterial.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The sun is reflected in many objects, such as windows, mirrors, shiny metal,oil, water, and so on, yet the sun remains one and indivisible. Similarly, theeternal spirit soul within the body is reflected through the screen of thematerial body. Thus the soul appears to be old or young, fat or skinny, happy orsad. The soul may appear to be American, Russian, African, Hindu orChristian; however, the eternal soul in its natural position is free of any material designation.</div>
<div class="First">The word sthüla-matibhiù in this verse indicates those whose intelligence isgross and dull. We have practical experience of a dog urinating on a valuablepainting at an outdoor art show. Due to its dull intelligence, the dog could notappreciate the actual value of the painting. Similarly, unless one takes toKåñëa consciousness, one is grossly misusing the invaluable opportunity ofhuman life. Human life is meant for self-realization, and we should not wastetime bickering over material designations such as capitalist, communist,American, Russian, and so on. Instead, all people should take to the lovingdevotional service of God and realize their eternal, pure identity. One shouldunderstand the sun by observing its direct manifestation and not its distortedreflection on material objects. Similarly, one should consider every livingbeing in terms of his pure spiritual identity beyond the distorted manifestation of material designations.</div>
<div class="First">The word ätmä in this verse also refers to the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. Just as we tend to observe ordinary jéva souls through the reflectionof the material body, we tend to observe the Personality of Godhead throughthe distorting screen of our material mind. Thus, we imagine God to beimpersonal or material or unknowable. When the sky is overcast, sunlight isthe highest possible perception of the sun, which is covered by clouds.Similarly, when one's mind is fogged over with mental speculation one maytake the light emanating from the transcendental body of God to be thehighest spiritual truth. However, when the mind is spotlessly clear like acloudless blue sky, one can see the actual form of the Personality of Godhead,Lord Kåñëa. The Absolute Truth cannot be perfectly understood by thecovered mind of the conditioned soul; rather, one must see the Lord throughthe clear blue sky of pure Kåñëa consciousness, which is free from fruitivedesires and mental speculation.

<div class="Translation"> One should never indulge in excessive affection or concern for anyone or anything; otherwise one will have to experience great suffering, just like the foolish pigeon.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Sanskrit prefix ati, or "excessive," indicates affection or attachment inwhich there is no Kåñëa consciousness. Lord Kåñëa says in Bhagavad-gétä(5.29), suhådaà sarva-bhütänäm: the Lord is the eternal well-wisher of everyliving being. The Lord is so affectionate that He sits in the heart of everyconditioned soul and accompanies him throughout his endless wandering inthe kingdom of mäyä, patiently waiting for the conditioned soul to come backhome, back to Godhead. Thus the Lord makes all arrangements for the eternalhappiness of every living entity. The best way for anyone to show compassionand affection for all living beings is to become a preacher on behalf of LordKåñëa and assist the Lord in reclaiming the fallen souls. If our affection orattachment for others is based on bodily sense gratification, in the name ofsociety, friendship and love, that excessive, unwanted affection (ati-sneha) willcause burning pain at the time of the breaking or destruction of therelationship. Now the story of the foolish pigeon will be narrated. A similarstory is described in the Seventh Canto, Second Chapter ofÇrémad-Bhägavatam, told by Yamaräja to the mourning widows of King Suyajïa.</div>

Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Seventh Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Lord Kåñëa Instructs Uddhava."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">8. The Story of Piìgalä</div>
<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa told Uddhava how the avadhüta brähmaëa explained toMahäräja Yadu the instructions he had received from nine of his gurus, beginning with the python.</div>
<div class="First">The instruction the avadhüta brähmaëa received from the python is that anintelligent person should cultivate a mentality of detachment and shouldmaintain his body by accepting whatever comes of its own accord or is easilyobtained. In this way, he should remain always engaged in the worship of theSupreme Personality of Godhead. Even if no food is available, the person whowants to engage fully in the Lord's worship should not beg; rather, he shouldunderstand this to be the arrangement of providence, thinking, "Whateverenjoyment is destined for me will automatically come, and thus I should notuselessly waste the remaining duration of my life in worrying about suchthings." If he does not get any food, he should simply remain lying like thepython and patiently fix his mind in meditation upon the Supreme Lord.The instruction the avadhüta brähmaëa received from the ocean is that themind of the sage who is devoted to the Personality of Godhead appears veryclear and grave, just like the still ocean waters. The ocean does not overflowduring the rainy season, when all the flooded rivers discharge their waters intoit, nor does it dry up during the hot season, when the rivers fail to supply it.Similarly, the sage does not become elated when he achieves desirable things, nor does he become distressed in their absence.</div>
<div class="First">The instruction of the moth is that just as he becomes enticed by the fireand gives up his life, the fool who cannot control his senses becomesenchanted by the forms of women decorated with gold ornaments and fineclothing. Chasing after these embodiments of the divine illusory energy of theLord, he loses his life untimely and falls down into the most horrible hell.There are two kinds of bees, the bumblebee and the honeybee. Theinstruction learned from the bumblebee is that a sage should collect only smallamounts of food from many different households and thus day after daypractice the occupation of mädhukaré for maintaining his existence. A sageshould also collect the essential truths from all scriptures, be they great orinsignificant. The instruction received from the second insect, the honeybee,is that a mendicant sannyäsé should not save the food he begs for the sake ofhaving it later that night or the next day, because if he does so, then just likethe greedy honeybee he will be destroyed along with his hoard.From the elephant the avadhüta brähmaëa received the followinginstruction. Male elephants are tricked by hunters into moving toward captivefemale elephants, whereupon they fall into the hunters' ditch and arecaptured. Similarly, the man who becomes attached to the form of woman fallsdown into the deep well of material life and is destroyed.The instruction received from the honey thief is that just as he steals thehoney collected with great effort by the honeybee, a person in the renouncedorder of life has the privilege of enjoying before anyone else the food andother valuable things purchased by the hard-earned money of the householders.</div>
<div class="First">The instruction from the deer is that just as he becomes confused uponhearing the song of the hunter's flute and loses his life, so also does any personwho becomes attracted to mundane music and song uselessly waste his life.The instruction learned from the fish is that because he comes under thesway of attachment to the sense of taste, he is caught on the baited fishhookand must die. Similarly, an unintelligent person who is victimized by his insatiable tongue will also end up losing his life.</div>
<div class="First">There was once a prostitute named Piìgalä in the city of Videha, and fromher the avadhüta learned another lesson. One day she dressed herself in veryattractive clothing and ornaments and was waiting from sunset until midnightfor a customer. She waited in great anticipation, but as the time passed hermind became very uneasy. No man came to see her, and in disgust she finallybecame renounced, giving up her hankering for the arrival of a suitor.Thereafter she engaged herself in thinking only of the Supreme Lord, Hari,and her mind achieved the supreme platform of peace. The instructionreceived from her is that hopes for sense gratification are the root cause of allsuffering. Therefore, only one who has given up such hankering can fixhimself in meditation upon the Personality of Godhead and achieve transcendental peace.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> The saintly brähmaëa said: O King, the embodied living entity automatically experiences unhappiness in heaven or hell. Similarly, happiness will also be experienced, even without one's seeking it. Therefore a person of intelligent discrimination does not make any endeavor to obtain such material happiness.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">One should not uselessly waste his life pursuing material sense gratification,because a specific quantity of material happiness will automatically come toone as a result of one's past and present fruitive activities. This lesson islearned from the ajagara, or python, who lies down and accepts for hismaintenance whatever comes of its own accord. Remarkably, in both materialheaven and hell happiness and unhappiness come automatically, due to ourprevious activities, although the proportions of happiness and unhappinesscertainly vary. Either in heaven or in hell one may eat, drink, sleep and havesex life, but these activities, being based on the material body, are temporaryand inconsequential. An intelligent person should see that even the bestmaterial situation is actually a punishment for previous unlawful activitiesexecuted outside the scope of loving devotional service to God. A conditionedsoul undergoes great trouble to obtain a little happiness. After struggling inmaterial life, which is full of hardship and hypocrisy, one may receive a littlesense gratification, but this illusory pleasure in no way offsets the burden ofsuffering one must bear to obtain it. After all, a pretty hat is no cure for ahomely face. If one really wants to solve life's problems, one should live simplyand reserve the major portion of one's life for loving service to Kåñëa. Eventhose who do not serve God receive a certain standard of maintenance fromHim; therefore we can just imagine the security the Lord affords to those who dedicate their lives to His devotional service.</div>
<div class="First">Unrefined fruitive workers foolishly worry only about the present life,whereas more pious karmés imprudently make elaborate arrangements forfuture material sense gratification, unaware that all such enjoyment istemporary. The real solution, however, is to understand that by pleasing thePersonality of Godhead, who is the master of all senses and all desires, one canattain permanent happiness. Such knowledge easily solves the problems of life.</div>

Diñöa-bhuk means onemust accept the Personality of Godhead as the supreme controller and notfoolishly give up one's faith due to material inconvenience. Tat te 'nukampäàsu-samékñamäëo bhuïjäna evätma-kåtaà vipäkam (SB 10.14.8).

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> A saintly person should remain peaceful and materially inactive, maintaining his body without much endeavor. Even though possessed of full sensual, mental and physical strength, a saintly person should not become active for material gain but rather should always remain alert to his actual self-interest.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The word véta-nidraù in this verse is very significant. Nidrä means "sleep" or"ignorance," and véta means "freed from." In other words, a transcendentalistshould always be awake to his eternal relationship with the SupremePersonality of Godhead and should carefully cultivate Kåñëa consciousness.Being confident of his relationship with the Lord, he should not endeavor forhis personal maintenance, knowing that the Lord is protecting him in allrespects. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura states that the example of thepython is given so that one will not uselessly waste his time in bodily maintenance.</div>
<div class="First">One should not think, however, that the purpose of life is to lie on theground like a python or to make a show of starving the body. The example ofthe python should not encourage one to become completely inactive. Oneshould rather become active in spiritual advancement and inactive in materialsense gratification. If one becomes completely inactive, that is certainly nidrä,or the darkness of ignorance, in which one remains asleep to his identity as an eternal servant of the Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="First">A transcendentalist is eager to execute his service to the Lord, andtherefore he is grateful when the Lord provides material facilities for suchservice. Mere renunciation of the material world is phalgu-vairägya, or animmature stage of spiritual understanding. One must come to the stage ofyukta-vairägya, engaging everything in the service of Lord Kåñëa. It is ourpractical experience that a devotee absorbed in spreading Kåñëa consciousnessautomatically receives all facilities for his personal maintenance.</div>

<div class="Translation"> A saintly sage is happy and pleasing in his external behavior, whereas internally he is most grave and thoughtful.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Even in the midst of great distress, a self-realized sage does not lose controlof himself, nor is his spiritual knowledge lost. Thus he is akñobhya, orundisturbed. His mind is fixed on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who isthe reservoir of unlimited spiritual bliss, and having linked his consciousnesswith the supreme consciousness, his knowledge cannot be measured. A puredevotee, having taken shelter of the Lord's lotus feet, possesses great spiritualpower, and therefore he cannot be surpassed or overwhelmed. In fact, havingdeveloped his spiritual body, he is not affected by the deteriorating actions oftime. Although outwardly he is friendly and pleasing to everyone, internallyhis mind is fixed in the Absolute Truth, and no one can understand his actualpurpose or plan. Even the most intelligent human being cannot understandthe mental activities of a self-realized devotee who has given up material lifebased on lust and greed and taken shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord. Such agreat soul can be compared to the mighty ocean. Innumerable powerful riversplunge into the ocean, but the ocean remains calm and peaceful. Thus, asaintly person is understood to be, like the ocean, pleasing, unfathomable, grave, unsurpassable, unlimited and unshakable.</div>

<div class="Translation"> During the rainy season the swollen rivers rush into the ocean, and during the dry summer the rivers, now shallow, severely reduce their supply of water; yet the ocean does not swell up during the rainy season, nor does it dry up in the hot summer. In the same way, a saintly devotee who has accepted the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the goal of his life sometimes will receive by providence great material opulence, and sometimes he will find himself materially destitute. However, such a devotee of the Lord does not rejoice in a flourishing condition, nor is he morose when poverty-stricken.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">A sincere devotee of the Lord is always eager to meet the Lord and renderHim transcendental service. He wants to remain fixed as an atom at the lotusfeet of the Lord because Lord Kåñëa, or Näräyaëa, is the reservoir of allpleasure. He rejoices when experiencing pure Kåñëa consciousness and ismorose when Kåñëa is not present in his mind. In his dealings with thematerial world, a devotee cannot be disturbed by ordinary, materialistic peoplewho sometimes insult him and accuse him of neglecting material sensegratification, just as the ocean cannot be disturbed by the innumerable riversthat enter into it. Sometimes lusty women approach a pure devotee, andsometimes speculative philosophers try to argue against the Personality ofGodhead, but with all such ordinary people, a pure devotee is detached and undisturbed in his blissful Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="Translation"> One who has failed to control his senses immediately feels attraction upon seeing a woman's form, which is created by the illusory energy of the Supreme Lord. Indeed, when the woman speaks with enticing words, smiles coquettishly and moves her body sensuously, his mind is immediately captured, and thus he falls blindly into the darkness of material existence, just as the moth maddened by the fire rushes blindly into its flames.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Çrédhara Svämé explains in this regard that just as a moth is killed byits attraction to the form of fire, similarly a bee can easily be killed byexploiting its attraction to the fragrance of flowers. Furthermore, hunters maytrap and kill an elephant by exploiting its sensuous desire to touch a captivefemale elephant and may also kill a deer by attracting it with the sounds oftheir horns; and a fish is killed by its desire to taste the bait on a hook. Thus,one who desires to learn detachment from material illusion should accept thesefive helpless creatures as guru and learn the needful. Certainly one who is lustyto enjoy the illusory form of woman will be quickly buried in material illusion.Of the five types of fatal attraction involving material sense objects, the lesson of rüpa, or form, is illustrated in this verse.</div>

Being eager for sense gratification, such a fool loses all intelligence and is destroyed just like the moth who rushes into the blazing fire.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Actually, women have the power to attract men through all of the materialsenses. Men become lusty by seeing the body of a woman, by smelling herfragrance, by hearing her voice, by tasting her lips and by touching her body.However, the foolish relationship based on material sex attraction begins byseeing, and thus rüpa, or form, is very prominent in the process of ruiningone's intelligence. This fact has been exploited in modern times by hugepornography industries, which prey on unfortunate men and women. Theexample of the foolish moth rushing into the fire and destroying itself is mostappropriate in this regard, for one who becomes addicted to the momentarypleasure of sex indulgence certainly loses his power to understand the spiritual reality behind dull matter.</div>
<div class="First">A lusty person becomes blind and foolish through sex indulgence, and hissoul is lost in the fire of sense gratification. This whole disaster can be avoidedby taking seriously to the process of chanting the holy names of the Lord: HareKåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, RämaRäma, Hare Hare. Caitanya Mahäprabhu and His empowered representativessuch as Çréla Prabhupäda have created a movement to save people from thedungeon of material life, and we should all seriously take advantage of this opportunity.</div>

Thus he will become bewildered by theillusion of family life and fall down from the platform of renunciation. Also, ifa mendicant takes unfair advantage of the Vedic custom of charity and takestoo often from a single family, the resentment he causes will disturb the socialorder. An ideal sage should, like the honeybee, travel from place to place, buthe must be careful not to become a chubby bee by going to many houses andeating sumptuously at each house. According to Çréla BhaktisiddhäntaSarasvaté Öhäkura, such a chubby bee will undoubtedly become entangled inthe network of mäyä. No one should be overly attached to the gratification ofhis tongue, because this will lead to an overstuffed belly and thenuncontrollable lust. In conclusion, one should not endeavor very much formaterial sense gratification but should instead endeavor strenuously to spreadthe glories of the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa. This is the proper use of human energy.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Just as the honeybee takes nectar from all flowers, big and small, an intelligent human being should take the essence from all religious scriptures.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In human society the original knowledge is called Veda, and the essentialpart of veda, or knowledge, is Kåñëa consciousness. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä(15.15), vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù. From the honeybee, an intelligenthuman being should learn to take the essence, or nectar, of all knowledge. Ahoneybee does not waste its time trying to carry away an entire bush or garden,but rather takes the essential nectar. We may thus study the differencebetween the honeybee and the ass, who carries heavy loads. Education doesnot mean to become an intellectual ass carrying heavy loads of uselessknowledge; rather, one should accept the essential knowledge that leads to an eternal life of bliss and understanding.</div>
<div class="First">At the present time people generally have a sectarian concept of religion,and yet there is no scientific understanding of the Absolute Truth. Suchcomplacent, dogmatic, sectarian religionists can certainly learn somethingfrom the example of the honeybee given in this verse.</div>

<div class="Translation"> A saintly person should not think, "This food I will keep to eat tonight and this other food I can save for tomorrow." In other words, a saintly person should not store foodstuffs acquired by begging. Rather, he should use his own hands as his plate and eat whatever fits on them. His only storage container should be his belly, and whatever conveniently fits into his belly should be his stock of food. Thus one should not imitate the greedy honeybee who eagerly collects more and more honey.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">There are two types of honeybees: those who collect nectar from the flowersand those who actually manufacture honey in the beehive. This verse refers tothe second class. The greedy honeybee eventually collects so much honey thathe is trapped in his hive; and in the same way, a materialistic person becomestrapped under the burden of unnecessary material accumulation. One who isinterested in making spiritual progress should avoid such a situation; however,Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura points out that for the purpose ofspreading Kåñëa consciousness one may accumulate an unlimited amount ofmaterial opulence. This is called yukta-vairägya, or using everything in theservice of Kåñëa. A saintly person who is unable to work in Lord Caitanya'smission should practice austerities and collect only what he can hold in hishands and belly. However, one who has given his life to Kåñëa may collectunlimitedly on Lord Kåñëa's behalf. In fact, without acquiring materialopulence, how is it possible to spread the Kåñëa consciousness movement allover the world? But if one tries to personally enjoy the funds or facilitiesacquired for the missionary activities of the Kåñëa consciousness movement,he commits the greatest offense. Therefore, even in the name of Lord Kåñëa,one should collect only what he can immediately engage in practicaldevotional service; otherwise one will fall down to the platform of ordinary greediness.</div>

<div class="Translation"> A greedy person accumulates a large quantity of money with great struggle and pain, but the person who has struggled so much to acquire this wealth is not always allowed to enjoy it himself or give it in charity to others. The greedy man is like the bee who struggles to produce a large quantity of honey, which is then stolen by a man who will enjoy it personally or sell it to others. No matter how carefully one hides his hard-earned wealth or tries to protect it, there are those who are expert in detecting the whereabouts of valuable things, and they will steal it.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">One may argue that a wealthy man may conceal his money so expertly, byinvesting it in banks, stocks, properties, and so on, that there is no danger oftheft. Only foolish people actually hide money by burying it in the ground orplacing it under a mattress. But despite the fact that the majority of the world'swealth has been accumulated in highly developed capitalistic countries, thesecountries are being severely challenged by many enemies who threaten at anymoment to overrun the capitalists and steal their wealth. Similarly, we oftenfind that the children of wealthy people are kidnapped, and then their parentsmust pay huge ransoms. Sometimes the parents themselves may also bekidnapped. Furthermore, there are so-called investment counselors who areexpert in stealing the money of rich people; and in the modern agegovernments have also become expert in stealing money by taxation. Thus, theword artha-vit indicates one who by hook or by crook is expert in stealing thehard-earned wealth of other people. The bees work frantically to producehoney, but they will not enjoy their honey. As Lord Kåñëa states, måtyuùsarva-haraç cäham: "I will come as death personified and steal everything." (Bg.10.34) Somehow or other one's hard-earned material opulence will be stolen,and therefore, as mentioned in this verse, one should not work uselessly like the foolish honeybee.</div>

If the householders enjoy such foodstuffs without first offeringthem in charity to the mendicants, such neglectful householders must undergothe lunar fast called cändräyaëam." In family life one must overcome thenatural tendency toward selfishness by giving abundant charity. Modernsociety foolishly does not observe such Vedic injunctions, and as a result theworld has become overrun by envious gåha-medhés, or persons wholly and solelydedicated to personal gratification in family life. Therefore, the whole world isseized in an uncontrollable spasm of violence and suffering. If one wants tolive peacefully one must follow the Vedic injunctions regulating family life.Although the householders work very hard to accumulate money, the saintlysannyäsés and brahmacärés have the right to first enjoy the fruits of such labor.The conclusion is that one should give first priority to spiritual advancementin Kåñëa consciousness and thus perfect one's life.

<div class="First">In this connection, Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura states that thebusiness of the tongue is to gratify itself with the varieties of flavor, but bywandering in the twelve holy forests of Vraja-mandala (Våndävana), one canbe freed from the twelve flavors of material sense gratification. The fiveprincipal divisions of material relationships are neutral admiration, servitude,friendship, parental affection and conjugal love; the seven subordinatefeatures of material relationships are material humor, astonishment, chivalry,compassion, anger, dread and ghastliness. Originally, these twelve rasas, orflavors of relationships, are exchanged between the Supreme Personality ofGodhead and the living entity in the spiritual world; and by wandering in thetwelve forests of Våndävana one can respiritualize the twelve flavors ofpersonal existence. Thus one will become a liberated soul, free from allmaterial desires. If one artificially tries to give up sense gratification, especiallythat of the tongue, the attempt will be a failure, and in fact one's desire forsense gratification will increase as a result of artificial deprivation.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">By eating, one gives energy and activity to all of the senses, and thus if thetongue is uncontrolled all of the senses will be dragged down to the materialplatform of existence. Therefore, by all means one must control the tongue. Ifone fasts, then all of the other senses become weak and lose their potency. Thetongue, however, becomes more greedy to taste delicious preparations, andwhen one finally indulges the tongue, all of the senses quickly go out ofcontrol. Therefore, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura advises that oneaccept mahä-prasädam, or the remnants of the Lord's food, in a moderateproportion. Since the tongue's function is also to vibrate, one should vibratethe glorious holy name of the Supreme Lord and taste the ecstasy of pureKåñëa consciousness. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, rasa-varjaà raso 'py asyaparaà dåñövä nivartate: [Bg. 9.59] only by the higher taste of Kåñëaconsciousness can one give up the deadly lower taste that keeps one imprisoned in material bondage.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura states that as long as one'sintelligence is materially covered, one cannot understand the pleasure ofKåñëa consciousness. Trying to enjoy without Kåñëa, the living entity leavesthe abode of the Supreme Lord, called Vrajabhümi, and comes down into thematerial world, where he quickly loses control of his senses. One becomesparticularly victimized by the tongue, belly and genitals, which exertintolerable pressure on the conditioned soul. These desires subside, however,when one reestablishes one's blissful relationship with the Lord, who is actuallythe reservoir of all pleasure. One who is attached to the taste of Kåñëaconsciousness automatically follows all of the rules and regulations of religiouslife due to spontaneous attraction to viçuddha-sattva, or the mode of puregoodness. Without such spontaneous attraction, one is certainly bewildered by the pushing of the material senses.</div>
<div class="First">Even the beginning stage of devotional service, called sädhana-bhakti(regulatory practice), is so powerful that it brings one to the platform ofanartha-nivåtti, where one becomes free from unwanted sinful habits and gainsrelief from the pressure of the tongue, belly and genitals. Thus one is deliveredfrom the bondage of material addiction and can no longer be cheated by theallurements of the material energy. As it is said, all that glitters is not gold.

Surely this man who is coming now will want to pay me for my love, and he will probably give lots of money."

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In this verse, Piìgalä states that by the Lord's mercy a self-realized soul cansee that the entire universe is existing within the jaws of the great serpent oftime. Certainly this is not a promising situation, and one who sees it loses hisdesire for sense gratification. Thus, by the Lord's causeless mercy, thespiritually sane living entity can protect himself from illusion.Since Piìgalä is now glorifying the Personality of Godhead for His mercy inawarding salvation, the following question might arise: Is she worshiping theLord out of love, or is she merely a salvationist desiring liberation frommaterial existence? In answer it may be said that in her Kåñëa conscioussituation she is already liberated, even though remaining in this world. Herprogram will now be simply to render loving service to the Personality ofGodhead without any personal desire, including that of salvation.</div>

<div class="Chapnum">9. Detachment from All that Is Material</div>
<div class="First">The avadhüta brähmaëa describes his seven remaining gurus, beginningwith the kurara bird. He also describes an additional guru, one's own body.The instruction received from the kurara bird is that attachment createsmisery, but the person who is unattached and has no material possessions is qualified to achieve unlimited happiness.</div>
<div class="First">The avadhüta brähmaëa learned from the foolish, lazy child that bybecoming free from anxiety a person becomes capable of worshiping theSupreme Personality of Godhead and experiencing supreme ecstasy.The instruction received from the young girl who kept just one conchshellbracelet on each wrist is that one should remain alone and thus steady one'smind. Then only will it be possible for one to fix one's mind completely on thePersonality of Godhead. Once several men arrived to ask for the hand of theyoung girl, whose relatives had coincidentally left the house. She went insideand began to prepare food for the unexpected guests by beating rice. At thattime her conchshell bracelets were making a loud noise, rattling against eachother, and in order to stop this sound she broke off the bracelets one by oneuntil at last only one remained on each arm. Just as two or more braceletsmake noise, if even two people reside in the same place, what to speak of many,there is every chance of mutual quarrel and useless gossip.The avadhüta brähmaëa also received instruction from the arrow maker,who was so absorbed in constructing an arrow that he did not even notice thatthe king was passing right by him on the road. In the same way, one muststrictly control one's mind, concentrating it in the worship of Lord Çré Hari.The avadhüta brähmaëa learned from the serpent that a sage should wanderalone, should not live in any prearranged place, should be always careful andgrave, should not reveal his movements, should take assistance from no one and should speak little.</div>
<div class="First">The instruction obtained from the spider, who spins his web from hismouth and then withdraws it, is that the Supreme Personality of Godheadsimilarly creates from out of Himself the whole universe and then winds it up into Himself.</div>
<div class="First">From the weak insect who assumed the same form as the peçaskåt wasp, theavadhüta brähmaëa learned that the living entity, under the sway of affection,hatred and fear, attains in his next life the identity of that object upon which he fixes his intelligence.</div>
<div class="First">Seeing that the fragile material body is subject to birth and death, one whois sober should become devoid of material attachment to this body and shouldproperly utilize the rare gift of human life in the pursuit of knowledge,endeavoring always for the achievement of the highest goal.</div>

<div class="Translation"> When many people live together in one place there will undoubtedly be quarreling. And even if only two people live together there will be frivolous conversation and disagreement. Therefore, to avoid conflict, one should live alone, as we learn from the example of the bracelet of the young girl.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has given a nice example in thisregard. Because the young girl mentioned in this story had no husband, shehad to fulfill her duties as a host by removing her bracelets so that each wristheld one bracelet only. In the same way, the process of jïäna-yoga, or spiritualadvancement by philosophical speculation, demands that the speculating sageslive alone, without any other association. Since jïänés have dedicated theirlives to speculation. there will undoubtedly be endless argument andquarreling on technical points if many jïänés live together. Therefore, to keepa peaceful atmosphere they must live alone. On the other hand, a king'sdaughter who has been duly married to an aristocratic prince fulfills her dutiesto her husband by dressing herself attractively with innumerable ornamentsand approaching him for love. Similarly, the goddess of devotion, Bhakti-devé,decorates herself with the innumerable ornaments of the Vaiñëavas, who cometogether to relish the sweet sound of the holy name of the Lord. Because pureVaiñëavas do not intimately associate with nondevotees, it may be said thatthey reside alone, and thus they also fulfill the purpose of this verse. Therecannot be any quarrel among pure Vaiñëavas, because they are on the realplatform of desirelessness, not wanting even salvation or mystic powers, whatto speak of sense gratification. Because they are all devotees of Kåñëa, theymay freely associate with one another for glorifying the Lord. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (3.25.34):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">naikätmatäà me spåhayanti kecin</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mat-päda-seväbhiratä mad-éhäù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ye 'nyonyato bhägavatäù prasajya</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sabhäjayante mama pauruñäëi</div>
<div class="First">"A pure devotee, who is attached to the activities of devotional service andwho always engages in the service of My lotus feet, never desires to becomeone with Me. Such a devotee, who is unflinchingly engaged, always glorifies My pastimes and activities."</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has commented on this verse asfollows: "The young girl in the story kept only one bracelet on each wrist sothat there would be no noisy conflict among the bracelets. Similarly, oneshould give up the association of those who are not devoted to the SupremeLord." This is the actual lesson to be learned. A real Vaiñëava is always pureand faultless in character. However, in those places where nondevoteescongregate there will undoubtedly be envious criticism of the devotionalservice of the Lord, and those who falsely attempt to analyze reality withoutthe Supreme Personality of Godhead will create much disturbing noise in thename of philosophy. Therefore, one should remain in those places where theSupreme Lord is properly worshiped according to the Vedic standard. Ifeveryone is dedicated to glorifying the Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, therewill not be any impediment in mutual association. However, in a place wherepeople have many different purposes besides the pleasure of the Supreme Lord, social dealings will certainly be disrupted.</div>
<div class="First">One should therefore avoid the association of those who are inimical todevotional service; otherwise one will be frustrated in achieving the spiritualpurpose of life. One who always keeps himself in the company of the devoteesof the Lord is actually living alone. If one lives in a community where the onlyconsideration is the pleasure of the Lord, then one can avoid the contradictorysituations caused by many persons competing to satisfy their own materialdesires. This is the lesson intelligently understood by the brähmaëa from the bracelets of the young girl.</div>
<div class="First">In this connection Çréla Madhväcärya quotes the following:</div>

<div class="Translation"> Having perfected the yoga sitting postures and conquered the breathing process, one should make the mind steady by detachment and the regulated practice of yoga. Thus one should carefully fix the mind on the single goal of yoga practice.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">One should develop vairägya, or detachment, by observing that all materialthings are doomed. Thus one should take to the regulated practice of yoga,which in this age means the process of chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra.According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the avadhüta brähmaëa isrecommending bhakti-miçra añöäìga-yoga, or the eightfold mystic yoga processperformed as an offering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.The desire to enjoy the material world is so strong that the mind wandershere and there uncontrollably. Therefore it is stated, dhriyamäëam: the mindmust be fixed in the goal of life, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In theperfect stage of mental concentration called samädhi there is no longer anydistinction between internal and external vision, since one can see the Absolute Truth everywhere.</div>
<div class="First">In the mystic yoga process one must sit properly, and then it is possible tocontrol the different airs within the body. When the breathing process iscontrolled, the mind, which is dependent upon the actions of the bodily airs, iseasily fixed in higher consciousness. But although the mind may bemomentarily controlled, if one is overcome by desire for sense gratification themind will again be lost. Thus, this verse emphasizes vairägya, detachment frommaterial illusion. This is attained by abhyäsa-yoga, the regulated practice ofKåñëa consciousness, which is the highest yoga system, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä (6.47):</div>

<div class="Translation"> The mind can be controlled when it is fixed on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Having achieved a stable situation, the mind becomes free from polluted desires to execute material activities; thus as the mode of goodness increases in strength, one can completely give up the modes of passion and ignorance, and gradually one transcends even the material mode of goodness. When the mind is freed from the fuel of the modes of nature, the fire of material existence is extinguished. Then one achieves the transcendental platform of direct relationship with the object of his meditation, the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The interaction of the three modes of nature creates great obstacles in one'spath of spiritual advancement, and there is danger that one may be throwndown into the darkness of ignorance.

If one can free oneself from theinfluence of the material modes of passion and ignorance, then life becomesvery auspicious. Controlling the mind, and thereby freeing oneself from theinfluence of the material modes of nature, is the only means of making actualprogress in life. The word yasmin in this verse, according to Çréla ÇrédharaSvämé, indicates the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the reservoir ofall pleasure. Giving up the material propensities of the mind does not meanmerging into an impersonal existence, such as that experienced in dreamlesssleep. As stated in this verse, sattvena våddhena: one must become firmlyestablished in the mode of goodness and then gradually rise onto the spiritualplatform, where one may dwell in the company of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Thus, when one's consciousness is completely fixed on the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one no longer sees duality, or internal and external reality. The example is given of the arrow maker who was so absorbed in making a straight arrow that he did not even see or notice the king himself, who was passing right next to him.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">It is understood that when a king moves on a public street he is heralded bykettledrums and other musical instruments and is accompanied by soldiers andother members of his retinue. Thus, despite this royal extravaganza passingright by his workshop, the arrow maker did not even notice because he wascompletely absorbed in his prescribed duty of making an arrow straight andsharp. One who is completely absorbed in loving devotional service to theAbsolute Truth, Çré Kåñëa, no longer pays attention to material illusion. Inthis verse the word bahis, "external" refers to the innumerable objects ofmaterial sense gratification, such as food, drink, sex, and so on, which drag thesenses of the conditioned soul into material duality. The word antaram, or"internal" refers to memory of previous sense gratification or hopes and dreamsfor future materialistic situations. One who is seeing everywhere the AbsoluteTruth, Çré Kåñëa, categorically rejects both internal and external illusion. Thisis called mukti-pada, or the status of liberation. On this platform there isneither attraction nor aversion to sense objects; rather, there is lovingabsorption in the Absolute Truth, Kåñëa, and an overwhelming desire toplease Him by devotional service. One who gives up the reality of Kåñëa will beforced to wander uselessly in the kingdom of mental speculation. One whocannot see that the Absolute Truth, Lord Kåñëa, is the background and basisof everything that exists will be bewildered by the false concept that there issomething that is not Kåñëa. Everything emanates from the Lord, and He isthe Lord of everything. This simple understanding is the actual existential situation.</div>

<div class="First">The previous narration concerning the shell bracelets of the young girldemonstrates that even saintly persons engaged in ordinary yoga processesshould remain alone to avoid conflict or disturbance. In other words, personsengaged in ordinary yoga processes should not even associate with each other.This verse indirectly refers to the serpent, who, fearing attack from humanbeings, keeps himself secluded. From this example we learn that a saintlyperson should not associate with ordinary materialistic people. He should alsoavoid having a fixed residence and should wander unnoticed by others.Our engagement in material existence is the cause of our unhappiness.Such engagement destroys the real purpose of our life, Kåñëa consciousness.Somehow or other one must give up the deep-rooted attachment to materialsociety, friendship and love. One must practice detachment, and by surrenderto the principles of Kåñëa consciousness one's auspicious life will begin. Byorganizing one's life according to the varëäçrama system one can take the firststep in self-realization. In other words, one should accept an honest occupationand regulate his sex life, either by giving it up entirely as a brahmacäré orsannyäsé or by living as a married householder. Without regulating one'soccupation and personal life, there will be chaos, and it will be very difficult tomake spiritual advancement. The attachments to material society, friendshipand love are based on a long previous experience in the material world. Theyare great obstacles in the path of transcendental understanding, and if onemaintains them, spiritual progress will be most difficult. Caitanya Mahäprabhutaught by His example and precept what a devotee should and should not do,and obedience to such principles brings one to the path of supreme perfection.Thus, one has to rise above ordinary social custom, which directs the living entity toward useless sense gratification.</div>

Çréla BhaktisiddhäntaSarasvaté Öhäkura points out that although materialistic persons takeunlimited pains to invent and mass-produce electricity, automobiles, airplanes,etc., ultimately these things are meant for the convenience of the Vaiñëavaswho are preaching Kåñëa consciousness. The karmés will always go to suchtrouble, and the devotees will always offer such laborious productions to theSupreme Personality of Godhead by engaging them in His loving service. Thedevotees, being concerned with the ultimate perfection of life, do notpersonally struggle for material advancement. On the other hand, there is noneed for the devotees to artificially imitate the austere life-style of ancienttimes. A devotee's goal is simply to serve Kåñëa as nicely as possible; thereforethe devotees willingly accept beautiful mansions and all types of materialopulences, not with any personal attachment, but only so that these things canbe engaged in the loving service of the Lord. If one engages such things with adesire to enjoy them, one falls down from the platform of pure devotionalservice. Materialistic persons are only interested in exploiting their so-calledyoga practice in order to rejuvenate their sexual potency or to vainlyremember their previous conditioned lives. Thus, applying mysticism to theendless search for sense gratification, they do not understand the actual goal of human life.</div>

According to the Brahma-saàhitä these innumerable worldsrest within the brahmajyoti, or spiritual effulgence, also emanating from theLord's body. Thus Kåñëa is éçvara, the supreme controller.</div>

<div class="Translation"> When the Supreme Personality of Godhead displays His own potency in the form of time and guides His material potencies, such as the mode of goodness, into a neutral condition of equilibrium, He remains as the supreme controller of that neutral state, called pradhäna, as well as of the living entities. He is also the supreme worshipable object for all beings, including liberated souls, demigods and ordinary conditioned souls. The Lord is eternally free from any material designation, and He constitutes the totality of spiritual bliss, which one experiences by seeing the Lord's spiritual form. The Lord thus exhibits the fullest meaning of the word "liberation."</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">One who fixes his mind in the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead,gets immediate relief from the waves of material anxiety because the Lord'stranscendental form is completely free of any material contamination ordesignation. Less intelligent persons accept the illogical doctrine that the Lordis transformed into His creation and maintains no separate, individualexistence. They falsely imagine that they can merge their individuality intothe universal oneness and become exactly equal to the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. However, in the opinion of Çrémad-Bhägavatam the Personality ofGodhead is not impersonal but is instead full of all transcendental qualities.The three modes of material nature constitute His inferior energy, and theomnipotent time factor, upon which the modes rest, is the personal expansionof the Lord. Thus, the Lord creates, maintains and annihilates the materialmanifestation and yet remains completely apart from it. The conditioned soulswho desire to exploit the Lord's inferior creation are impelled by thePersonality of Godhead to do so, and thus they become imitation enjoyers inthe temporary world of matter. But when one gains practical experience thatthe gross and subtle material bodies are simply coverings of the eternal soul,one gives up the foolishness of material attachment and becomes attached tothe Supreme Personality of Godhead. He realizes that his constitutionalposition is neither to enjoy matter nor merge into the Lord's existence. His realnature is that he is a servant of God. Service rendered to the Lord is eternal,full of bliss and knowledge, and by the potency of such service one becomesliberated and his activities become glorious. Such service is eternal andgradually promotes one to the platform of kevalänubhavänanda-sandoha, ormerging into the ocean of bliss by seeing the transcendental personal form of the Lord.</div>

<div class="First">The word kevala means "pure" and indicates that the Lord's kälaçakti, ortime potency, is a transcendental energy nondifferent from His personal body.The brähmaëa addresses King Yadu here as arindama, subduer of the enemies.This indicates that although the topic of mäyä, or illusory creation, is beingdiscussed, the King need not worry, because as a staunch devotee of the Lord,he is able to subdue the real enemies of life, namely lust, anger and greed,which make one a prisoner in mäyä's kingdom. The word sütram indicates themahat-tattva, on which many material creations rest, just like jewels rest on athread. In the state of pradhäna, or material equilibrium, the modes of naturedo not interact. In the Third Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Lord Kapilaexplains in His Säìkhya teachings that the Supreme Personality of Godheadagitates the neutral state of nature and thus creation takes place.

<div class="Translation"> O King, once a wasp forced a weaker insect to enter his hive and kept him trapped there.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The following question may be raised: Since the weaker insect in this storydid not physically change his body, how can it be said that he achieved thesame state of existence as the wasp? Actually, by constant meditation upon aparticular object one's consciousness becomes filled with its qualities. Due toextreme fear the smaller insect was absorbed in the characteristics andactivities of the large wasp and thus entered into the existence of the wasp.Due to such meditation, he actually took the body of a wasp in his next life.Similarly, although we are conditioned souls, if we absorb our consciousnessin Lord Kåñëa we can become liberated even before giving up our presentbody. If our intelligence becomes steady on the spiritual platform byunderstanding that Lord Kåñëa is everything, then we can give up unnecessaryconsciousness of the external body and absorb ourselves in the spiritualpastimes of Vaikuëöha. Thus even before death one can raise oneself to thespiritual platform and enjoy life as a liberated soul. Or, if one is a stubbornfool, then even in this life one can become just like an animal, such as a hog ora dog, constantly thinking of eating and sex life.

The body does not award detachment andknowledge in the manner of some benevolent teacher; rather, it causes somuch pain and misery that any commonsense person cannot help beingconvinced of the uselessness of material life. Just as a tree produces the seeds ofthe next tree and then dies, the body's lusty desires induce the conditionedsoul to create a further chain of karma. Finally the body, having paved the wayfor unlimited suffering in material existence, drops dead.According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, deha indicates boththe gross body and the subtle, mental body. Those who do not clearlyunderstand the difference between body and soul falsely think that body andsoul are identical and that one can find perfect happiness in bodily sensegratification. But those who foolishly accept the temporary body asall-important cannot be compared with self-realized souls who intelligently understand the superiority of the eternal soul.</div>

<div class="Translation"> A man who has many wives is constantly harassed by them. He is responsible for their maintenance, and thus all the ladies constantly pull him in different directions, each struggling for her self-interest. Similarly, the material senses harass the conditioned soul, pulling him in many different directions at once. On one side the tongue is pulling him to arrange tasty food; then thirst drags him to get a suitable drink. Simultaneously the sex organs clamor for satisfaction, and the sense of touch demands soft, sensuous objects. The belly harasses him until it is filled, the ears demand to hear pleasing sounds, the sense of smell hankers for pleasant aromas, and the fickle eyes clamor for pleasing sights. Thus the senses, organs and limbs, all desiring satisfaction, pull the living entity in many directions.</div>

If one takes to Kåñëa consciousness, the Supreme Lord personallyfeels happiness and gradually reveals Himself to His devotee.The Lord's material creation consists of the living entities and dead matter,which the less intelligent try to enjoy. The Lord, however, is not satisfied bythose species that blindly strive for sense gratification without understandingspiritual nature. We are suffering due to our forgetfulness of Kåñëa and theblissful situation of His abode. If we accept the Lord as protector and shelterand execute His order, we can easily revive our eternal, blissful nature as partsand parcels of the Personality of Godhead. It is for this purpose that the Lord has created human life.</div>

Even ordinary houseflies have a busy sex life and thusmultiply rapidly. Human life, however, enables one to understand theAbsolute Truth and is therefore full of grave responsibility.

In conclusion, human life is meant for cultivating Kåñëaconsciousness under the guidance of the experienced, self-realized devotees of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Çrédhara Svämé comments on this verse as follows. "The statementthat one requires many spiritual masters certainly needs explanation, sincepractically all great saintly persons of the past did not take shelter of manyspiritual masters, but rather accepted one. The words géyate bahudharñibhiù,'the Absolute Truth is glorified in many ways by the sages,' indicate thepersonal and impersonal understandings of the Absolute Truth. In otherwords, some sages describe only the Lord's impersonal effulgence, which iswithout spiritual variety, whereas others describe the Lord's manifest form asthe Personality of Godhead. Thus, merely by hearing from many differentauthorities, one cannot actually learn the highest perfection of life. Theproliferation of differing spiritual authorities is useful only to counteract theliving entities' tendency to be grossly materialistic. Different spiritualphilosophers create faith in the existence of the soul and may be accepted atthat level. But as will be clarified in later verses, the spiritual master who ultimately gives perfect knowledge is one."</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Jéva Gosvämé comments as follows on this verse. "Since it is commonlyunderstood that one is to accept a single spiritual master, why is itrecommended that one learn from many so-called spiritual masters appearingin the forms of ordinary material objects? The explanation is that one'sworshipable spiritual master will instruct one in many departments ofknowledge by giving lessons gleaned from ordinary objects. As recommendedby the brähmaëa avadhüta, one can strengthen the teachings received fromone's äcärya and avoid transgressing his orders by observing ordinary things innature. One should not mechanically receive the teachings of one's guru. Thedisciple should be thoughtful and with his own intelligence realize in practicewhat he has heard from his spiritual master by observing the world aroundhim. In this sense one may accept many gurus, though not those who preachagainst the knowledge received from the bona fide spiritual master. In otherwords, one should not hear from persons like the atheist Kapila."Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura also comments on this verse, asfollows. "It is stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam, tasmäd guruà prapadyeta jijïäsuùçreya uttamam: [SB 11.3.21] 'Therefore one should approach a bona fidespiritual master if one actually desires to achieve the highest perfection in life.'Similarly, in Chapter Ten, verse 5 of this canto, the Personality of GodheadHimself states, mad-abhijïaà guruà çäntam upäséta mad-ätmakam: 'One mustserve a bona fide spiritual master who is in full knowledge of My personalityand who is not different from Me.' There are many similar verses in Vedicliterature indicating that one must take shelter of a single bona fide spiritualmaster. We also have the examples of innumerable great saintly persons whodid not accept more than one spiritual master. Thus, it is a fact that we shouldaccept one bona fide spiritual master and receive from him the particularmantra that one is to chant. I myself certainly follow this principle andworship my bona fide spiritual master. However, in worshiping one's äcärya,one may take help from good and bad examples. By observing examples of goodbehavior one will be strengthened in devotional service, and in seeing negativeexamples one will be forewarned and avoid danger. In this way, one mayaccept many ordinary material objects as one's spiritual masters, consideringthem as çikñä-gurus, or gurus who give important lessons for spiritual advancement."</div>
<div class="First">Thus in the Lord's own words, mad-abhijïaà guruà çäntam upäsétamad-ätmakam: one should approach a single bona fide spiritual master who isin full knowledge of the Lord's personality and sincerely worship him,considering him to be mad-ätmakam, or nondifferent from the Lord Himself.This statement does not contradict what the Lord has presented in theteachings of the avadhüta brähmaëa. If one receives the teachings of one'säcärya but keeps them locked up in his brain as theoretical dogma, one willmake little advancement. To develop steady, complete knowledge one must seethe teachings of one's äcärya everywhere; thus a Vaiñëava offers all respects toanyone or anything that gives him further enlightenment in the path ofworshiping his bona fide äcärya, who is nondifferent from Lord Kåñëa.Among the many gurus mentioned by the brähmaëa, some give positiveinstructions and others give negative instructions. Piìgalä the prostitute andthe young girl who took off her bracelets provide examples of proper conduct,whereas the hapless pigeons and the foolish honeybee provide examples ofbehavior to be avoided. In both cases one's spiritual knowledge is enriched.Thus, one should not misunderstand the meaning of this verse in a waycontradictory to the Lord's statement mad-abhijïaà guruà çäntam upäséta mad-ätmakam (SB 11.10.5).</div>

<div class="Chapnum">10. The Nature of Fruitive Activity</div>
<div class="First">In this chapter Lord Çré Kåñëa refutes the philosophy of the followers ofJaimini and describes to Uddhava how the spirit soul bound within thematerial body can develop pure transcendental knowledge.The Vaiñëava, or one who has taken shelter of the Supreme Personality ofGodhead, Viñëu, should observe the rules and regulations found in thePaïcarätra and other revealed scriptures. According to his own naturalqualities and work, he should follow the code of varëäçrama in a spirit freefrom motivation. The so-called knowledge received through one's materialsenses, mind and intelligence is as useless as the dreams experienced by asleeping person attached to sense gratification. Therefore, one should give upwork performed for sense gratification and accept work as a matter of duty.When one has come to understand something of the truth of the self, heshould give up material work performed out of duty and simply engage himselfin the service of the bona fide spiritual master, who is the manifestrepresentative of the Personality of Godhead. The servant of the spiritualmaster should have very firm affection for his guru, should be anxious toreceive from him knowledge of the Absolute Truth, and should be devoid ofenvy and the tendency to talk nonsense. The soul is distinct from the grossand subtle material bodies. The spirit soul who has entered into the materialbody accepts bodily functions according to the reactions of his own pastactivities. Therefore, only the bona fide, transcendental spiritual master is capable of demonstrating pure knowledge of the self.</div>
<div class="First">The followers of Jaimini and other atheistic philosophers accept regulatedmaterial work as the purpose of life. But Kåñëa refutes this by explaining thatthe embodied soul who has come into contact with segmented material timetakes upon himself a perpetual chain of births and deaths and is thereforeforced to suffer the consequent happiness and distress. In this way there is nopossibility that one who is attached to the fruits of his material work canachieve any substantial goal in life. The pleasures of heaven and otherdestinations, which are achieved by sacrificial rituals, can be experienced foronly a short time. After one's enjoyment is finished, one must return to thismortal sphere to partake of lamentation and suffering. On the path ofmaterialism there is certainly no uninterrupted or natural happiness.</div>

Similarly, in Bhagavad-gétä (4.13) the Lordsays, cätur-varëyaà mayä såñöaà guëa-karma-vibhägaçaù: "I have personallycreated the varëäçrama system." There are innumerable rules and regulationsin the varëäçrama system, and the devotee should execute those which do notcontradict the process of devotional service. The term varëa indicatesdifferent classes of human beings, some in the mode of ignorance, some in themode of passion and some in the mode of goodness. Devotional service to theLord is executed on the liberated platform, and therefore some injunctions forthose persons in passion and ignorance may be contradictory to the regulativeprinciples for those on the liberated platform.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Because the fruits of material work are temporary, it ultimately does notmatter whether or not one obtains them; the final result is the same.Materialistic activities can never award the highest perfection of life, Kåñëaconsciousness. The material intelligence, impelled by the senses, stronglydesires sense gratification. As stated here (bhedätma-dhéù), such intelligenceactually separates one from one's real self-interest. Thus the intelligence,absorbed in that which is materially favorable and unfavorable, becomesdivided in pursuit of innumerable categories of material advancement. Suchdivided intelligence is impotent and cannot understand the Absolute Truth,the Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa. The devotees of the Lord, however,have their intelligence fixed on one point—Lord Kåñëa. They meditate uponthe Lord's form, qualities, pastimes and devotees, and thus their intelligence isnever separated from the Absolute Truth. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (2.41):</div>

The material intelligence will alwaysdevise novel means of achieving happiness, and therefore one bounces fromone fruitless program of sense gratification to another, ignoring the simple factthat all material things are temporary and will disappear. In this way one'sintelligence becomes infected with material lust and greed, and such infectedintelligence cannot bring one to the true goal of life. One should hear from thebona fide spiritual master whose intelligence is pure, and then one will come to Kåñëa consciousness, the highest perfection of life.</div>

<div class="Translation"> One who has fixed Me within his mind as the goal of life should give up activities based on sense gratification and should instead execute work governed by the regulative principles for advancement. When, however, one is fully engaged in searching out the ultimate truth of the soul, one should not accept the scriptural injunctions governing fruitive activities.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains that the words jijïäsäyäàsampravåttaù refer to one who is yoga-ärüòha, or advanced in the yoga process. In Bhagavad-gétä (6.3-4) it is stated:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ärurukñor muner yogaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">karma käraëam ucyate</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yogärüòhasya tasyaiva</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">sarva-saìkalpa-sannyäsé</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yogärüòhas tadocyate</div>
<div class="First">"For one who is a neophyte in the eightfold yoga system, work is said to be themeans; and for one who has already attained to yoga, cessation of all materialactivities is said to be the means. A person is said to have attained to yogawhen, having renounced all material desires, he neither acts for sensegratification nor engages in fruitive activities." The example may be given thatan ordinary man will try to enjoy the company of women for material sensepleasure. This is called pravåtta-karma, or the path of sense gratification. Areligious person will also enjoy the company of a woman, but under theregulative principles of the varëäçrama system. However, one who is fullyabsorbed in spiritual advancement will ultimately give up all sensegratification derived from sexual association, either regulated or illicit.Similarly, in the stage of pravåtta-karma, or ordinary sense gratification, onewill eat whatever pleases his tongue. On the other hand, a materialisticdevotee will sometimes cook sumptuous preparations and offer them to theDeity, not in order to satisfy the Lord but rather with the intention ofsatisfying his own tongue and belly. However, one who is sampravåtta, or fullyengaged in spiritual consciousness, is never interested in simply gratifying histongue. He avoids ordinary foods prepared by materialistic persons, and justfor the purpose of keeping his body fit for serving Kåñëa he eats moderatequantities of food that has first been offered to the Deity for the Deity's pleasure.</div>
<div class="First">The process of spiritual realization gradually brings a conditioned soul fromthe lowest point of materialistic consciousness to total absorption in lovingservice to the Personality of Godhead. In the beginning one is taught todovetail one's enjoying propensities by first offering to the Lord the fruit ofone's work. In the advanced stage, however, the impulse to execute fruitiveactivities (karma-codanäm) is absent, and one simply engages in the lovingservice of the Lord without any selfish motive. For example, a renouncedsannyäsé preaching Kåñëa consciousness, or even a renounced householderpreaching Kåñëa consciousness, is not required to execute all of theinjunctions governing sense gratification in family life. Ultimately, everyhuman being should take to the transcendental duties of Kåñëa consciousness.Rather than working to fulfill one's own desires and then offering the resultsto Kåñëa, one should fully engage in pleasing the Lord directly according to His own intimate desires.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, any attempt toenjoy the material world, either religiously or irreligiously, ultimately will befull of contradictions. One should come to the the platform of desirelessness,pure love of Godhead, and thus solve all of the problems of life.</div>

<div class="Translation"> One who has accepted Me as the supreme goal of life should strictly observe the scriptural injunctions forbidding sinful activities and, as far as possible, should execute the injunctions prescribing minor regulative duties such as cleanliness. Ultimately, however, one should approach a bona fide spiritual master who is full in knowledge of Me as I am, who is peaceful, and who by spiritual elevation is not different from Me.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The word yamän refers to major regulative injunctions necessary forpreserving one's purity. In the Kåñëa consciousness movement all bona fidemembers must give up eating meat, fish and eggs, and they must also avoidintoxication, gambling and illicit sex. The word abhijïam indicates that onecannot at any time perform such forbidden activities, even in difficultcircumstances. The word niyamän refers to less obligatory injunctions, such asbathing three times daily. In certain difficult situations one may not bathethree times daily yet may still maintain one's spiritual position. But if oneengages in sinful, forbidden activities, even in difficult circumstances, thereundoubtedly will be a spiritual falldown. Ultimately, as explained inUpadeçämåta, mere adherence to rules and regulations cannot give onespiritual perfection. One must approach a bona fide spiritual master who ismad-abhijïam, or in full knowledge of the personal form of Godhead. Theword mat ("Me") negates the possibility of a bona fide spiritual master havingan impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth. Furthermore, the guru mustbe in complete control of his senses; therefore he is called çänta, or peaceful.Because of being completely surrendered to the mission of the Lord, such aspiritual master is mad-ätmakam, or nondifferent from the Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="First">No one can claim to be the permanent proprietor of his so-called wife,family, home, society, and so on. Such material relationships appear anddisappear like bubbles on the surface of the ocean. No one can claim to be thecreator of the material elements that produced one's home, society and family.If it were a fact that parents were the ultimate creators of the bodies of theirchildren, children would never die before their parents; the parents wouldsimply create new bodies for the children. Similarly, parents would also notdie, because they would create new bodies for themselves to replace the oldones. Actually, God creates everyone's bodies as well as the material elementswith which we build our material societies. Therefore, before death drags thesethings out of our grasp, we should voluntarily engage them in the lovingservice of the spiritual master, who is the bona fide representative of LordKåñëa. Then such material objects, instead of causing lamentation, will be the cause of happiness.</div>

<div class="Translation"> One should see one's real self-interest in life in all circumstances and should therefore remain detached from wife, children, home, land, relatives, friends, wealth and so on.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">A devotee of the Lord recognizes that his wife, children, home, land, friendsand money are meant to be engaged in the loving service of the Supreme Lord.Therefore, he does not frantically make arrangements for the sensegratification of his family and friends. He is not eager to enjoy the falseprestige of being the master of his wife and the lord of his children, nor is heanxious to gain prestige from his friends and society. Thus he does not envyanyone and is not lazy in the matter of self-realization. He is free from the falsesense of proprietorship and is always eager to develop his understanding of theSupreme Personality of Godhead. He is free from false egotism andautomatically turns away from useless materialistic conversation. Thus he issteady and not whimsical, and he is always firmly situated in loving friendship at the lotus feet of the spiritual master.</div>
<div class="First">The question may be raised as to how one can develop freedom from falseproprietorship. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has given the followingexample. An ordinary man is very eager to accumulate more and more money,and he maintains his wealth in the form of stocks, bonds, securities, bankaccounts, properties, gold, and so on. As long as these different assets arecontributing to his financial well-being, he sees them equally and considersthat they belong to him. But if some of his assets are taken by the governmentfor taxes, or if they are lost in an unfortunate business arrangement, then he isforced to give up his sense of proprietorship. In the same way, everyone shouldbe intelligent enough to observe that one's sense of ownership overinnumerable material objects is not permanent; therefore one should developdetachment from these things. If one does not cultivate a loving feeling offriendship for the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His pure devotee, thespiritual master, one will undoubtedly be entangled by the network of materialsociety, friendship and love. One will then remain bound up on the material platform with no hope of permanent happiness.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Just as fire, which burns and illuminates, is different from firewood, which is to be burned to give illumination, similarly the seer within the body, the self-enlightened spirit soul, is different from the material body, which is to be illuminated by consciousness. Thus the spirit soul and the body possess different characteristics and are separate entities.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">It is analytically demonstrated in this verse that one should never falselyidentify the ego with the material body. Such misidentification is called falseego, or material illusion. The following question may be raised. Since it iscommonly known that the Supreme Personality of Godhead enlightens theconditioned soul, why is the term sva-dåk, or "self enlightened," used in thisverse? Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains that although theSupreme Personality of Godhead certainly furnishes consciousness to theliving entity, the living entity, being endowed with the potency of the Lordhas himself the capacity to revive and expand his pure consciousness. He maytherefore be considered, in a secondary sense, self-enlightened. The examplemay be given that gold or silver domes brilliantly reflect the rays of the sun.Although the light comes from the sun, the inherent properties of gold andsilver can also be considered causes for the brilliant reflection, since othersubstances do not possess suitable properties to reflect the sun's light. Similarly,the spirit soul can be considered sva-dåk, or self-enlightened, because hepossesses characteristics by which he can brilliantly reflect the potency of thePersonality of Godhead, thus illuminating his existential situation, just as agold or silver dome shines due to its reflective properties.A nice example is given in this verse to illustrate the differentcharacteristics of the body and soul. Fire, which burns and illuminates, isalways different from that which is burned for illumination. It may be said,however, that fire is present in an unmanifest form within wood. Similarly, inthe conditioned life of ignorance, the spirit soul is present, though unmanifest,within the body. The enlightened condition of the living entity can becompared to the act of arousing fire within wood. Just as fire quickly burnswood to ashes, similarly the spirit soul, when enlightened, burns to ashes thedarkness of ignorance. We are conscious of the body; therefore it may be saidthat the body is illuminated by consciousness, which is the energy, or symptom,of the spirit soul. Identifying the body and soul as one is just as foolish asconsidering fire and wood to be the same. In both cases, the intimatecircumstantial connection between fire and wood or between the soul and thebody does not alter the fact that fire is different from wood or that the soul is always different from the body.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Just as fire may appear differently as dormant, manifest, weak, brilliant and so on, according to the condition of the fuel, similarly, the spirit soul enters a material body and accepts particular bodily characteristics.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Although fire may appear and disappear within a particular object, theelement fire always exists. Similarly, the eternal soul appears within a suitablebody and then disappears from that body, but the soul always exists. Just as fireis different from its fuel, the soul is different from the body. A match makes atiny fire, whereas the explosion of a huge gasoline tank will send flamesshooting up into the sky. But still, fire is one. Similarly, one spirit soul mayappear in the body of Brahmä and another in the body of an ant, but the spiritsoul is qualitatively the same in every body. Because of ignorance we imposethe bodily characteristics upon the soul, and thus we say that a particularperson is American, Russian, Chinese, African or Mexican or that he is old oryoung. Although such designations certainly apply to the body, they do notapply to the spirit soul, which is described here as paraù, or a transcendentalentity. As long as the bewildered spirit soul remains inimical to the SupremePersonality of Godhead, the designations of the gross and subtle bodies willwrap themselves around him, keeping him in darkness. If one intellectuallyidentifies oneself with various materialistic philosophies of life, he becomescovered by the subtle mind. Ultimately everything that exists is part andparcel of the Absolute Truth, Lord Kåñëa. When the living entity realizes this,he becomes nirupädhi, or free from material designations. This is his constitutional position.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> The subtle and gross material bodies are created by the material modes of nature, which expand from the potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Material existence occurs when the living entity falsely accepts the qualities of the gross and subtle bodies as being his own factual nature. This illusory state, however, can be destroyed by real knowledge.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Regarding the analogy comparing fire and its fuel to the soul and the body,one may argue that to some extent fire is dependent upon its fuel and cannotexist without it. Since we do not experience the existence of fire independentof fuel, one may therefore still question how it is possible for the living entityto exist separately from the body, become covered by it and eventually becomefree from it. Only through the Supreme Personality of Godhead's knowledgepotency (vidyä) can one clearly understand the nature of the living entity. Byvidyä, or real knowledge, one may cut material existence to pieces and even inthis lifetime experience spiritual reality. According to Çréla ViçvanäthaCakravarté Öhäkura, our material existence is an artificial imposition. By theLord's inconceivable potency of nescience, the qualities of gross and subtlematerial forms are psychologically imposed upon the living being, and becauseof misidentification with the body, the living entity initiates a series of illusoryactivities. As explained in the previous chapter, the present material body islike a tree that produces the karmic seed of the next body. However, this cycleof ignorance can be cut to pieces by the transcendental knowledge explained by the Lord.</div>
<div class="First">Unfortunately, the conditioned souls, being inimical to the SupremePersonality of Godhead, do not accept the perfect knowledge spoken by theLord. Instead they remain absorbed in gross and subtle illusion. But if theliving entity accepts the Lord's knowledge, his whole situation can be rectified,and he can return to his original, eternal, blissful life of perfect knowledge in the direct association of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> By submissively hearing from an expert spiritual master, the expert disciple develops pure knowledge, which repels the onslaught of material illusion arising from the three modes of material nature. Finally this pure knowledge itself ceases, just as fire ceases when the stock of fuel has been consumed.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Sanskrit word vaiçäradé means "that which is derived from the expert[viçärada]." Perfect transcendental knowledge comes from the expert spiritualmaster, and when such knowledge is heard by the expert disciple, it curbs thewaves of material illusion. Since the Lord's illusory energy acts eternallywithin the material world, there is no possibility of destroying illusion. Onemay, however, destroy the presence of illusion within one's own heart. Toaccomplish this the disciple must become expert in pleasing the expertspiritual master. As one advances to the perfectional stage of Kåñëaconsciousness, experiencing the presence of the Lord everywhere, one'sattention shifts to the transcendental platform. At that time, pure knowledgeitself, one's constant technical awareness of illusion, diminishes, just as firediminishes and is extinguished after consuming its stock of fuel.Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted from several Vedic scriptures to show thatmäyä, or material illusion, is just like a witch who always haunts theconditioned souls. Mäyä offers the conditioned souls whatever they like withinthe three modes of nature, but such offerings are all just like fire that burns theheart to ashes. Therefore, one must understand that the material world is ahellish place, offering a permanent situation to no one. Externally weexperience many things, and internally we contemplate our experience,formulating plans for future action. Thus internally and externally we arevictims of ignorance. Real knowledge comes from the Vedas, or the SupremePersonality of Godhead in His form of perfect wisdom. If we become fullyKåñëa conscious, taking complete shelter of the Lord, there will be no scarcityof pleasure, because the Lord is the reservoir of all pleasure, and His devotees freely move within that reservoir.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear Uddhava, I have thus explained to you perfect knowledge. There are philosophers, however, who challenge My conclusion. They state that the natural position of the living entity is to engage in fruitive activities, and they see him as the enjoyer of the happiness and unhappiness that accrue from his own work. According to this materialistic philosophy, the world, time, the revealed scriptures and the self are all variegated and eternal, existing as a perpetual flow of transformations. Knowledge, moreover, cannot be one or eternal, because it arises from the different and changing forms of objects; thus knowledge itself is always subject to change. Even if you accept such a philosophy, My dear Uddhava, there will still be perpetual birth, death, old age and disease, since all living entities must accept a material body subject to the influence of time.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In this verse, according to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, LordKåñëa speaks the following to Uddhava. "My dear Uddhava, I have clearlyestablished the actual goal of life in the instructions I have just imparted toyou. There are those, however, who challenge My conclusion, especially thefollowers of Jaimini Kavi. If you are favorable to their understanding and thusdo not accept My instructions, then kindly hear the following explanation."According to the followers of Jaimini, the living entity is originally andnaturally a performer of fruitive activities, and his happiness and distress arederived from the fruits of his own work. The world in which the living entitiesfind their enjoyment, the time during which they enjoy, the revealedscriptures that explain the means for achieving enjoyment, and the subtlebodies through which the living entities experience enjoyment all exist not only in manifold variety but also eternally.</div>
<div class="First">"The living entity need not develop detachment from material sensegratification, either by seeing the temporariness of individual material objectsand situations or by seeing the material world as an illusory creation (mäyä).According to such materialistic philosophy, material objects such as garlands,sandalwood or beautiful women are temporary in specific manifestations butperpetually exist through the natural flow of creation and destruction. In otherwords, although a particular woman's form is temporary, there will eternally bebeautiful women within the material world. Thus, by carefully executingfruitive rituals according to religious scriptures, one can maintain enjoyablecontact with women and wealth life after life. In this way one's sense gratification will be eternal.</div>
<div class="First">"The Jaimini philosophers further say that there never was a time when theworld did not exist as it does today, which implies that there is no supremecontroller who has created it. They claim that the arrangement of this world isreal and appropriate and thus is not illusory. Moreover, they say that there isno eternal knowledge of an original perpetual form of the soul. In fact, theysay, knowledge arises not from some absolute truth but from the differencesamong material objects. Knowledge therefore is not eternal and is subject tochange. The assumption hidden in this statement is that there is no spirit soulwho possesses eternal, constant knowledge of a single, unchanging reality.Rather, the nature of consciousness or knowledge is that it undergoes constanttransformation. They state, however, that eternality is not refuted by theperpetually transforming nature of consciousness. Consciousness perpetually exists, they say, but not in the same form.</div>
<div class="First">"Thus, the followers of Jaimini conclude that the transformation ofknowledge does not negate its eternality; rather, they state that knowledgeeternally exists within the perpetual nature of its transformation. Theytherefore naturally come to the path of regulated sense gratification ratherthan the path of renunciation, for in the state of mukti, or liberation, theliving entity would not have any material senses, and thus the transformationof material understanding would not be possible. Such philosophers considerthat the achievement of an unchanging state of mukti would stunt or paralyzethe natural activity of the living entity and thus would not be in hisself-interest. The path of nivåtti (aiming toward renunciation andtranscendence of the material world) is naturally not interesting to suchmaterialistic philosophers. Accepting for argument's sake the validity of suchmaterialistic philosophy, one can easily demonstrate that the path of regulatedsense gratification brings many unwanted and miserable results to the livingentity. Therefore even from a materialistic viewpoint, detachment is desirable.Material time is divided into different sections such as days, weeks, monthsand years, and by material time the living entity is repeatedly forced toundergo the miseries of birth, death, old age and disease. That such realmiseries occur everywhere throughout the universe is well known." In this way,states Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, Lord Kåñëa has pointed out the defect of materialistic philosophy to Uddhava.</div>
<div class="First">We may further elaborate that if one falsely accepts the atheisticphilosophy of Jaimini and his innumerable modern followers. then the livingentity perpetually remains entangled in the anguish of birth, death, old ageand disease. This bogus, atheistic philosophy encourages material gratificationas the only logical goal of life, but the living entity will inevitably commitmistakes in the execution of regulated sense gratification and eventually go tohell. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa, personally tellsUddhava that this materialistic philosophy is false and irrelevant to the actual self-interest of the living entity.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Although the performer of fruitive activities desires perpetual happiness, it is clearly observed that materialistic workers are often unhappy and only occasionally satisfied, thus proving that they are not independent or in control of their destiny. When a person is always under the superior control of another, how can he expect any valuable results from his own fruitive actions?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Although materialistic persons reject Kåñëa consciousness and insteadpursue temporary sense gratification, even that sense gratification is oftenbeyond their reach. If a person could really control his destiny, why would hecreate problems for himself? No intelligent person would impose death, old ageor disease upon himself or his loved ones. One should recognize that theseunwanted miseries are forced upon one by a higher power. Since we are allobviously under superior control, the atheistic philosophy advising one tosimply perform fruitive activities and create a happy life is most imperfect.Due to the influence of time, happiness and misery are created. When awoman becomes pregnant, her husband, relatives and friends eagerly await thebirth of the child. As time passes and the child is born, everyone feels greathappiness. But as the child grows into old age and eventually dies, that samepassage of time is a cause of suffering. Ignorant persons vainly seek help fromscientists who work feverishly and fruitlessly in their laboratories to stopdeath. In modern times, inventions have been created to eliminate theinconveniences of life, but the maintenance and production of suchconveniences has proven to be unbearably inconvenient for hundreds ofmillions of people throughout the world. Only the most foolish person willpropose that there is no superior controller and that one can achieve favorableresults by expert performance of material activities. Ultimately all materialactivities are useless because they end in annihilation. If one is driving a carbut has only limited control, the situation is most dangerous and must leadinevitably to disaster. Similarly, although we are trying to direct the materialbody to happiness, we are not in full control of the bodily demands, andtherefore there will inevitably be disaster. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (9.3),</div>

<div class="Translation"> It is observed within the material world that sometimes even an intelligent person is not happy. Similarly, sometimes even a great fool is happy. The concept of becoming happy through expertly performing material activities is simply a useless exhibition of false egotism.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">It may be argued that an intelligent person can expertly perform piousactivities within the material world and thus never experience suffering, sinceunhappiness is caused by sinful or impious activities. However, we oftenobserve great suffering even among pious, intelligent persons, because theysometimes fail in the execution of their duty and sometimes consciously orunconsciously perform a forbidden activity. With this argument the Lordrefutes the theory that simply on the strength of material piety one mayremain perpetually happy without Kåñëa consciousness.On the other hand, we observe that even the most foolish or sinful personssometimes experience happiness, because even those completely dedicated tosin sometimes accidentally perform pious activities by inadvertently travelingthrough a holy place or helping a saintly person. The material creation of Godis so complex and bewildering that even those dedicated to piety sometimescommit sins, and even those dedicated to sinful life sometimes perform piousactions. Therefore, within the material world we do not find absolutehappiness or unhappiness. Rather, every conditioned soul is hovering inconfusion, without perfect knowledge. Piety and sin are relative material ideasthat bestow relative happiness and unhappiness. Absolute happiness isexperienced on the spiritual platform in full Kåñëa consciousness, or love ofGod. Thus material life is always ambiguous and relative, whereas Kåñëaconsciousness is the actual platform of perfect happiness.</div>

It is most foolish to think that one can be happy with an axhanging over one's neck. Lord Kåñëa says in Bhagavad-gétä, måtyuù sarva-haraçcäham: [Bg. 10.34] "I Myself come before you as death and take everythingaway." We should not blindly ignore the disaster of material life, but shouldinstead accept the Lord's causeless mercy, which He so magnanimously offersin His incarnation as Caitanya Mahäprabhu,. We should surrender to the lotusfeet of Lord Caitanya, who offers the real means for achieving unqualifiedhappiness: the chanting of the holy names of the Lord.

Similarly, those whoare expert in analyzing the material world see that the heavenly situationsoffered in the Vedas are not basically different from life on the earth. By theinteraction of conditioned souls there will inevitably be jealousy as onebecomes distinguished as superior and another as inferior. By the power oftime these positions are reversed, and therefore violence and intrigue disturblife even on the heavenly planets. In fact, the attempt to promote oneself tothe heavenly planets is itself full of problems and disturbances. One shouldtherefore understand that the kingdom of God, Vaikuëöha, is transcendentalto the limitations and disturbances imposed by the laws of material nature inthis world. If one wrongly concludes that such imperfections are also presentin the kingdom of God, then one will be polluted by material contamination."</div>

When the mind is so polluted one becomes violent and aggressive and without the authority of Vedic injunctions slaughters innocent animals for sense gratification.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the Vedic analysis of civilized life there are two paths. One who takes tothe path of nivåtti-märga immediately renounces material sense gratificationand purifies his existence by performance of austerity and devotionalactivities. On the path of pravåtti-märga one furnishes a steady supply of senseobjects to the senses, but one consumes such sense objects under strictregulations and through ritualistic ceremonies, thus gradually purifying theheart and satiating the material senses. Unfortunately, as explained in this andthe previous verse, the path of pravåtti-märga is extremely volatile becauserather than becoming detached, the living entity often becomes uncontrolledand fully addicted to further sense gratification. In the previous verse the pathof regulated, authorized sense gratification was described, and in this verse thepath of unauthorized, demoniac sense gratification is described.In this verse, the words saìgäd asatäà väjitendriyaù are very significant.One may fall down into sinful life by bad association, or even in goodassociation one may fail to control his senses. Ultimately each living entity isresponsible for his existential situation. The word adharma-rataù in this verseindicates those engaged in excessive sex life, meat-eating, drinking and otherinauspicious activities that transgress the codes of civilized human life. Beingin the mode of ignorance, these persons develop such a cruel mentality thatthey do not consider any festive occasion complete without the consumptionof large quantities of meat obtained by slaughtering helpless animals.Eventually such persons become influenced by ghosts and spirits, who deprivethem of all ability to discriminate between right and wrong. Losing all sense ofdecency, they become fit candidates for entrance into the darkest modes ofmaterial existence. Sometimes these lusty, intoxicated carnivores, consideringthemselves pious, pray to God in a useless way. Afflicted by innumerablematerial desires, they rotate from one material body to another withoutexperiencing true happiness. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura hasnoted that material life is so disturbing that even if one is allowed to live foran entire day of Brahmä—approximately 8,640,000,000 years—one willeventually be afflicted by the fear of death. In fact, Brahmä himself isdisturbed by fear of death, what to speak of tiny human beings who live apaltry seventy or eighty years at most.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">It has been explained in the previous verses that the living entity under thecontrol of fruitive activities is pushed down into a hellish condition of life. Inthis verse the exact nature of the living entity's dependence on fruitiveactivities is described. One can observe that one's activities are performed bythe material senses and that the living entity himself is merely conscious ofsuch activities. One may be worshiping the demigods, enjoying sex orperforming agricultural or intellectual activities, but in all cases the material senses are performing the work.</div>
<div class="First">One may argue that the spirit soul initiates the activities of the senses andthus is the ultimate doer, but such false egotism is negated in this verse by thestatement guëäù såjanti karmäëi guëo 'nusåjate guëän. The three modes ofnature—goodness, passion and ignorance—stimulate the functions of thematerial senses, and the living entity, coming under the control of a particularmode of nature, merely experiences the good and bad results of his work. Thisdoes not negate the concept of free will, since the living entity chooses toassociate with different modes of nature. By one's eating, speaking, sexualactivities, occupation, etc., one associates with various modes of nature andacquires a particular mentality. But in all cases the modes of nature themselvesare acting, not the living entity. The word asau in this verse indicates that theliving entity falsely considers himself to be the performer of work carried out by nature. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (3.27):</div>

<div class="First">"The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of materialnature, thinks himself to be the doer of activities, which are in actualitycarried out by nature." The conditioned soul can be liberated simply by givingup this false egoistic conception of life and taking to the devotional service ofthe Lord, by which the living entity, or marginal potency of the SupremePersonality of Godhead, escapes the disturbing influence of the externalpotency called mäyä. In the devotional service of the Lord the liberated entityrealizes his actual form of eternity, knowledge and bliss.It is natural to perform activities with a desire to achieve a good result. Thebest results, however, can be attained by one who engages in the devotionalservice of the Lord with a desire to be reinstated in his constitutional positionas the Lord's loving servant. In this way the tendency to exploit one's ownactivities for a particular result can be purified; then the modes of nature andthe material senses will no longer engage the living entity in illusion. Theliving entity is by nature blissful, and when his illusion ceases, all sufferingcomes to an end. The liberated soul is then fit to reside in Vaikuëöha, the kingdom of God.</div>

However, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa, is theactual basis of everything. Everything is within Him, and He is withineverything. A pure devotee of the Lord sees Kåñëa everywhere and sees all ofthe variegated modes of nature as the potency of Lord Kåñëa. One who doesnot see Lord Kåñëa will certainly see material variegatedness as the supremereality. Such vision is called mäyä, or gross illusion, and is similar to the visionof an animal.

A conditioned soul considers himself to be in control of his life,but since he does not have any actual controlling potency, his situation iscontradictory and not at all pleasing. As all of one's material possessions aretaken away by time, one becomes filled with lamentation.

<div class="First">One can experience the potency of the Personality of Godhead byobserving how different species of life—demigods, human beings, animals, fish,birds, insects, plants, etc.—gradually evolve their natures and activities. Eachspecies of life executes a particular process of sense gratification, and thisfunction is called the dharma of the species. Lacking knowledge of thePersonality of Godhead, ordinary persons catch a glimpse of the Lord'spotencies in the above-mentioned manifestations. Çréla Madhväcärya has citedthe following information from the Tantra-bhägavata. The Lord is called käla,or time, because He is the mover and controller of all material qualities.Because He is complete and perfect, He is called ätmä, or the Self; and He isthe personification of all knowledge. The word svabhäva indicates that theLord fully controls His own destiny; and as the maintainer of everyone He iscalled dharma. One on the liberated platform can achieve unlimited bliss byworshiping the Personality of Godhead, whereas those who are ignorant of theLord try to find meaning by concocting other objects of worship. If onestubbornly imagines that anything is independent of the Lord, one will remainin the grip of the illusory network of the Lord's potency. Seeing theinevitability of the destruction of material things, one is constantly fearful andperpetually laments in the darkness of ignorance. In such darkness there is noquestion of happiness. Therefore, one should never think that anything isindependent of the Personality of Godhead. As soon as one considers anythingto be independent of the Lord, one is immediately gripped by the Lord'sillusory network, called mäyä. One should always remain humble and obedientto the Personality of Godhead, even when one is liberated, and thus one will achieve the supreme spiritual happiness.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Çré Uddhava said: O my Lord, a living entity situated within the material body is surrounded by the modes of nature and the happiness and distress that are born of activities caused by these modes. How is it possible that he is not bound by this material encirclement? It may also be said that the living entity is ultimately transcendental and has nothing to do with the material world. Then how is he ever bound by material nature?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Due to the influence of the modes of nature the material body generatesfruitive activities, which in turn generate material happiness and distress. Thismaterial chain reaction is indicated by the word deha-jeñu. The Personality ofGodhead has shown Uddhava that the actual goal of life is liberation, notsense gratification. Although the Lord has indicated that the living entity isliberated by devotional service performed with knowledge and renunciation,Uddhava apparently does not understand the specific means of perfection.According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, Uddhava's questionimplies that we observe even in the activities of liberated souls such externalactivities as eating, sleeping, walking, hearing, speaking, etc., which arefunctions of the gross and subtle bodies. Thus, if even liberated souls aresituated within the gross and subtle material bodies, then how are they notbound by the material modes of nature? If it is argued that the living entity islike the sky, which never mixes with any other object and therefore is notbound, then one may ask how such a transcendental living entity can ever bebound by material nature. In other words, how would material existence bepossible? In order to completely clarify the path of Kåñëa consciousness,Uddhava presents this question to the supreme spiritual authority, Lord Kåñëa.In the kingdom of mäyä there are innumerable speculations about theSupreme Lord, who is variously described as nonexistent, or as possessingmaterial qualities, or as being devoid of all qualities, or as being a neuter objectlike a eunuch. But through mundane speculation it is not possible tounderstand the nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. ThereforeUddhava wants to clear the path of spiritual liberation so that people canactually understand that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Aslong as one is affected by the modes of nature, perfect understanding is notpossible. Lord Kåñëa will now describe to Uddhava further details of spiritual emancipation on the road back home, back to Kåñëa.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In previous verses Lord Kåñëa has explained to Uddhava that an eternallyliberated soul is beyond the three modes of material nature. Since a liberatedsoul is considered to be beyond even the superior mode of goodness, how canhe be recognized? By false identification with the modes of nature, whichproduce one's own material body, one is bound by illusion. On the other hand,by transcending the modes of nature, one is liberated. However, in ordinaryactivities—such as eating, evacuating, relaxing, sitting and sleeping—aliberated soul and a conditioned soul appear to be the same. ThereforeUddhava is inquiring, "By what symptoms can I recognize that one livingentity is performing such external activities without false ego, and by whatsymptoms can I recognize one who is working under the illusory bondage ofmaterial identification? This is difficult, because the ordinary bodily functionsof liberated and conditioned personalities appear similar." Uddhava hasapproached the Supreme Personality of Godhead, taking Him as his personalspiritual master, and wants to be enlightened about how to understand the differences between material and spiritual life.</div>
<div class="First">Since the living entity is sometimes called eternally conditioned, how couldhe ever be considered eternally liberated, or vice versa? This is an apparentcontradiction, which will be cleared up by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="First">Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Tenth Chapter, of theÇrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Nature of Fruitive Activity."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">11. The Symptoms of Conditioned and Liberated Living</div>
<div class="First"> Entities</div>
<div class="First">In this chapter, Lord Çré Kåñëa describes to Uddhava the differencebetween conditioned and liberated living entities, the characteristics of asaintly person and the different aspects of the practice of devotional service.In the previous chapter Uddhava had presented questions regardingconditioned and liberated souls. In His replies, the almighty Lord Çré Kåñëastates that although the spirit soul is part and parcel of the SupremePersonality of Godhead, on account of his infinitesimal nature, he falls intocontact with the material energy, which causes him to accept the coveringdesignations of the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. Thus the soulhas been bound up since time immemorial. But when he achieves the shelter ofpure devotional service, he becomes designated as eternally liberated.Transcendental knowledge is therefore the cause of the living entity'sliberation, and ignorance is the cause of his bondage. Both knowledge andignorance are produced by the mäyä energy of Lord Çré Kåñëa and are Hiseternal potencies. The living entities who become attracted to the modes ofnature are bewildered by false ego, which causes them to see themselves as theenjoyers of misery, confusion, happiness, distress, danger, and so on. In thisway, they meditate upon such states of being, although in the real, or spiritual,world these things do not exist. Both the jéva (individual soul) and theSupersoul reside within the same body. The difference between them is thatthe almighty Supersoul, being fully cognizant, does not indulge in enjoying thefruits of material work but remains simply as a witness, whereas theinfinitesimal conditioned jéva, being ignorant, suffers the consequences of hisown work. The liberated jéva, in spite of being within a material body becauseof the remaining reactions of his past activities, does not become disturbed bythe happiness and suffering of the body. He sees such bodily experiences in thesame way that a person who has just awakened from a dream sees his dreamexperiences. On the other hand, although the conditioned living entity is bynature not the enjoyer of the happiness and misery of the body, he imagineshimself to be the enjoyer of his bodily experiences, just as a person in a dreamimagines his dream experiences to be real. Just as the sun reflected upon wateris not actually bound up in the water, and just as the air is not confined tosome particular segment of the sky, similarly a detached person takesadvantage of his broad outlook on the world to cut off all his doubts with thesword of appropriate renunciation, yukta-vairägya. Since his life force, senses,mind and intelligence have no tendency to fix themselves on sense objects, heremains liberated even while situated within the material body. Regardless ofwhether he is harassed or worshiped, he remains equipoised. He is thereforeconsidered liberated even in this life. A liberated person has nothing to dowith the piety and sin of this world, but rather sees everything equally. Aself-satisfied sage does not praise or condemn anyone. He does not speakuselessly to anyone and does not fix his mind on material things. Rather, he isalways merged in meditation upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, so inthe eyes of fools he seems to be a speechless, crazy person.Even if someone has studied or even taught all the different Vedicliteratures, if he has not developed pure attraction to the service of thePersonality of Godhead, he has accomplished nothing beyond his own labor.One should study only those scriptures in which the nature of the SupremePersonality of Godhead, His enchanting pastimes and the nectarean topics ofHis various incarnations are scientifically discussed; thus one gains the highestgood fortune. However, by studying scriptures other than these one simply acquires misfortune.</div>
<div class="First">With full determination one should properly understand the identity of thesoul and give up false identification with this material body. He may then offerhis heart at the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, Çré Kåñëa, the reservoir of alllove, and attain real peace. When the mind is carried away by the three modesof nature, it can no longer meditate properly on the transcendental SupremeTruth. After many lifetimes, faithful persons who have performed Vedicsacrifices for acquiring religiosity, economic development and sensegratification finally engage in hearing, chanting and constantly thinking ofthe Supreme Lord's all-auspicious pastimes, which purify the entire universe.Such persons then achieve the association of a bona fide spiritual master andthe saintly devotees. After that, by the mercy of the spiritual master they beginto follow the paths set out by the standard authorities of spiritual life, themahäjanas, and become actually perfect in realization of their own true identity.</div>
<div class="First">Having heard these instructions from Lord Kåñëa, Uddhava further desiredto understand the characteristics of a factually saintly person and the differentaspects of devotional practice. Lord Kåñëa replied that a real sädhu, orVaiñëava, is qualified with the following characteristics. He is merciful,nonenvious, always truthful, self-controlled, faultless, magnanimous, gentle,clean, nonpossessive, helpful to all, peaceful, dependent on Kåñëa alone, freefrom lust, devoid of material endeavor, steady, in control of the six enemies ofthe mind, moderate in eating, never bewildered, always respectful to others,never desirous of respect for himself, sober, compassionate, friendly, poetic,expert and silent. The principal characteristic of a sädhu is that he takesshelter of Kåñëa alone. One who engages exclusively in Kåñëa's service andunderstands Him as the limitless, indwelling Lord who comprises eternity,knowledge and bliss, is the topmost devotee. The practice of devotional serviceincludes sixty-four kinds of activities. Among these are: (1-6) seeing, touching,worshiping, serving, glorifying and offering obeisances to the Deity of the Lordand His pure devotees; (7) developing attachment for hearing the chanting ofthe Lord's qualities, pastimes, and so on; (8) remaining always in meditationupon the Lord; (9) offering everything one acquires to the Lord; (10) acceptingoneself to be the Lord's servant; (11) offering the Lord one's heart and soul;(12) engaging in glorification of the Lord's birth and activities; (13) observingholidays related to the Lord; (14) performing festivals in the Lord's temple inthe company of other devotees, and with music, singing and dancing; (15)celebrating all varieties of yearly functions; (16) offering foodstuffs to theLord; (17) taking initiation according to the Vedas and tantras; (18) takingvows related to the Lord; (19) being eager to establish Deities of the Lord; (20)endeavoring either alone or in association with others in constructing, for theservice of the Lord, vegetable and flower gardens, temples, cities, and so on;(21) humbly cleansing the temple of the Lord; and (22) rendering service tothe Lord's house by painting it, washing it with water and decorating it with auspicious designs.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In this chapter the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, explains thedifferent characteristics of conditioned and liberated life, the symptoms bywhich one can recognize saintly persons, and the various processes ofdevotional service to the Lord. In the previous chapter, Uddhava inquiredfrom the Lord how conditioned and liberated life are possible. The Lord nowreplies that Uddhava's question is somewhat superficial, since the pure spiritsoul is never entangled in the material energy of the Lord. The living entityimagines a false connection with the three modes of nature and accepts thematerial body as the self. The living entity therefore suffers the consequencesof his own imagination, just as one suffers the illusory activities of a dream.This does not indicate that the material world is illusory in the sense that it isnonexistent. The material world is certainly real, being the potency of thePersonality of Godhead, and the living entity, being the superior potency ofGod, is also real. But the living entity's dream of being part and parcel of thematerial world is an illusion that drags him into the contradictory state calledmaterial conditioned life. The living entity is never actually baddha, or boundup, since he merely imagines a false connection with the material world.Because there is ultimately no permanent connection between the livingentity and matter, there is no actual liberation. The living entity, beingeternally transcendental to the inferior material energy of the Lord, iseternally liberated. Lord Kåñëa reveals that in one sense the living entity isfactually not bound up and thus cannot be liberated. But in another sense, theterms bondage and liberation can be conveniently applied to indicate theparticular situation of the individual soul, who is the marginal potency of theLord. Although the individual soul is never actually bound to matter, hesuffers the reactions of material nature because of false identification, and thusthe term baddha, or "bound up," may be used to indicate the nature of a livingentity's experience within the inferior energy of the Lord. Since baddhadescribes a false situation, freedom from such a false situation may also bedescribed as mokña, or liberation. Therefore the terms bondage and liberationare acceptable if one understands that such terms only refer to temporarysituations created by illusion and do not refer to the ultimate nature of theliving entity. In this verse Lord Kåñëa states, guëasya mäyä-mülatvän na memokño na bandhanam: the terms liberation and bondage can never be applied tothe Supreme Personality of Godhead, since He is the Absolute Truth and thesupreme controller of everything. Lord Kåñëa is eternally the supremetranscendental entity, and He can never be bound by illusion. It is the duty ofthe illusory potency of the Personality of Godhead to attract the living entitiesto ignorance by creating the false impression of a blissful existence separatefrom Lord Kåñëa. The illusory conception of existence apart from thePersonality of Godhead is called mäyä, or material illusion. Since Lord Kåñëa isthe supreme absolute controller of mäyä, there is no possibility that mäyä couldhave any influence over the Personality of Godhead. Thus the termbandhanam, or "bondage," cannot be applied to the eternal, blissful andomniscient Personality of Godhead. The term mokña, or "liberation,"indicating freedom from bandhana, is equally irrelevant to the Lord.Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has commented on this verse asfollows. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is endowed with great spiritualpotencies. Because of mundane concoction, the conditioned soul imagines thatthe Absolute Truth is devoid of variegated spiritual potencies by which Hemay enjoy blissful life. Although the living entity is the spiritual potency ofthe Lord, he is presently situated in the inferior, illusory potency, and byengaging in mental speculation he becomes bound in conditioned life.Liberation means that the living entity should transfer himself to the spiritualpotency of the Lord, which can be divided into three categories—hlädiné, thepotency of bliss; sandhiné, the potency of eternal existence; and saàvit, thepotency of omniscience. Since the Personality of Godhead is eternallyendowed with a pure existence of bliss and knowledge, He is neverconditioned or liberated. The living entity, however, being entangled in theLord's material potency, is sometimes conditioned and sometimes liberated.The neutral, original state of the three modes of nature is called mäyä.When the three modes of nature interact, one of them will become powerful,subordinating the other two modes until another mode becomes prominent. Inthis way, the three can be distinguished in their variety of manifestation.Although the threefold material potency expands from the Personality ofGodhead, the Lord Himself in His personal form is the actual abode of thethree spiritual potencies, namely eternality, bliss and knowledge. If one desiresto become free from the entanglement of conditioned life within the materialsky, called the kingdom of mäyä, one must come to the spiritual sky, whereinthe living entities are filled with bliss, possess eternal spiritual bodies andengage in the loving devotional service of the Lord. By developing one'seternal, spiritual form in the loving service of the Lord, one immediatelytranscends the duality of conditioned life and impersonal liberation and candirectly experience the spiritual potencies of the Lord. At that time there is nopossibility of false identification with the material world.Realizing oneself to be eternal spirit soul, the living entity can understandthat he is never truly connected to matter, because he is part of the superiorenergy of the Lord. Therefore, both material bondage and liberation areultimately meaningless within the reality of the spiritual sky. The living entityis the marginal potency of the Lord and should exercise his free will to engagein the pure devotional service of the Lord. By reviving one's eternal, spiritualbody one can understand oneself to be a minute particle of the spiritualpotency of the Lord. In other words, the living entity is a minute particle ofeternity, bliss and omniscience, and thus in full Kåñëa consciousness there isno possibility of his being carried away by the illusion of the three modes ofnature. In conclusion, it may be stated that the individual living entity is neveractually entangled in matter and is thus not liberated, although his illusorystate may be accurately described as entangled and liberated. On the otherhand, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally situated in His ownspiritual potencies and can never be described as being bound up, and thusthere is no meaning to the concept of the Lord's freeing Himself from such a nonexistent condition.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Just as a dream is merely a creation of one's intelligence but has no actual substance, similarly, material lamentation, illusion, happiness, distress and the acceptance of the material body under the influence of mayä are all creations of My illusory energy. In other words, material existence has no essential reality.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The word deha-äpattiù indicates that the living entity falsely identifieshimself with the external material body and thus transmigrates from one bodyto another. Äpatti also indicates great suffering or misfortune. Because of suchfalse identification under the influence of illusion, the living entityexperiences the miserable symptoms described here. Mäyä means the falseconcept that anything can exist without Lord Kåñëa or for any purpose otherthan the pleasure of the Supreme Lord. Although the conditioned livingentities are trying to enjoy material sense gratification, the result is alwayspainful, and such painful experiences turn the conditioned soul back towardthe Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, the ultimate purpose ofthe material creation is to bring the living entity back to the loving devotionalservice of the Lord. Therefore, even the sufferings of the material world maybe seen as the transcendental mercy of the Personality of Godhead. Theconditioned soul, imagining that material objects are meant for his personalenjoyment, bitterly laments the loss of such objects. In this verse, the exampleis given of a dream in which the material intelligence creates many illusoryobjects. Similarly, our polluted material consciousness creates the falseimpression of material sense gratification, but this phantasmagoria, beingdevoid of Kåñëa consciousness, has no real existence. By surrendering topolluted material consciousness, the living entity is afflicted with innumerabletroubles. The only solution is to see Lord Kåñëa within everything andeverything within Lord Kåñëa. Thus, one understands that Lord Kåñëa is thesupreme enjoyer, the proprietor of everything and the well-wishing friend of all living beings.</div>
<div class="First">In material illusion there is no understanding of one's eternal, spiritualbody, nor is there knowledge of the Absolute Truth. Therefore, materialexistence, even in its most sophisticated or pious form, is always foolishness.One should not misunderstand the example of the dream to mean that thematerial world has no real existence. Material nature is the manifestation ofthe Lord's external potency, just as the spiritual sky is the manifestation of theLord's internal potency. Although material objects are subject totransformation and thus have no permanent existence, the material energy isreal because it comes from the supreme reality, Lord Kåñëa. It is only our falseacceptance of the material body as the factual self and our foolish dream thatthe material world is meant for our pleasure that have no real existence. Theyare merely mental concoctions. One should cleanse oneself of materialdesignations and wake up to the all-pervading reality of the Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa.</div>

<div class="Translation"> O Uddhava, both knowledge and ignorance, being products of mäyä, are expansions of My potency. Both knowledge and ignorance are beginningless and perpetually award liberation and bondage to embodied living beings.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">By the expansion of vidyä, or knowledge, a conditioned soul is liberatedfrom the clutches of mäyä, and similarly, by the expansion of avidyä, orignorance, the conditioned soul is driven further into illusion and bondage.Both knowledge and ignorance are products of the mighty potency of thePersonality of Godhead. The living being is bound by illusion when heconsiders himself the proprietor of the subtle and gross material bodies.According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé the living entity may be designated asjéva-mäyä, whereas matter is called guëa-mäyä. The living entity places hisliving potency (jéva-mäyä) in the grip of the mundane qualitative potency(guëa-mäyä) and falsely dreams that he is part and parcel of the materialworld. Such an artificial mixture is called illusion or ignorance. When all ofthe Lord's potencies are correctly perceived in their proper categories, theliving entity is liberated from material bondage and returns to his blissful eternal residence in the spiritual sky.</div>
<div class="First">The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not different from His potencies,yet He is always above them as the supreme controller. The SupremePersonality of Godhead may be designated as mukta, or liberated, only toindicate that He is eternally free from material contamination and never toindicate that the Lord has been freed from actual entanglement in a materialsituation. According to Çréla Madhväcärya, vidyä indicates the goddess offortune, the internal potency of the Lord, whereas avidyä indicates Durgä, theexternal potency of the Lord. Ultimately, however, the Personality ofGodhead can transform His potencies according to His own desire, asexplained by Çréla Prabhupäda in his commentary on Çrémad-Bhägavatam(1.3.34), "Because the Lord is the absolute Transcendence, all of His forms,names, pastimes, attributes, associates and energies are identical with Him. Histranscendental energy acts according to His omnipotency. The same energyacts as His external, internal and marginal energies, and by His omnipotencyHe can perform anything and everything through the agency of any of theabove energies. He can turn the external energy into internal by His will."Çréla Çrédhara Svämé notes in this regard that although the Lord hasexplained in the first verse of this chapter that the living entity is neveractually in bondage, and therefore never actually liberated, one may apply theterms bondage and liberation if one remembers that the living entity iseternally a transcendental fragment of the Personality of Godhead. Further,one should not misinterpret the words mäyayä me vinirmite to indicate thatboth material bondage and liberation are temporary states, being creations ofthe potency of the Lord. Therefore, the term ädye, or "primeval and eternal" isused in this verse. The vidyä and avidyä potencies of the Lord are stated to becreations of mäyä because they carry out the functions of the Lord's potencies.The vidyä potency engages the living entities in the Lord's pastimes, whereasthe avidyä potency engages the living entities in forgetting the Lord andmerging into darkness. Actually, both knowledge and ignorance are eternalalternatives of the marginal potency of the Lord, and in this sense it is notincorrect to state that the living entity is either eternally conditioned oreternally liberated. The term vinirmite, or "produced," in this case indicatesthat the Lord expands His own energy as knowledge and ignorance, whichdisplay the functions of the Lord's internal and external potencies. Suchpotential exhibitions may appear and disappear in different times, places andcircumstances, but material bondage and spiritual freedom are eternal options of the marginal potency of the Lord.</div>

<div class="First">"Besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superiorenergy of Mine, consisting of all living entities who are struggling withmaterial nature and are sustaining the universe." Çréla Prabhupäda states inconnection with this verse: "The Supreme Lord Kåñëa is the only controller,and all living entities are controlled by Him. These living entities are Hissuperior energy because the quality of their existence is one and the same withthe Supreme, but they are never equal to the Lord in quantity of power."Because of quantitative inferiority of potency, the living entity becomescovered by mäyä and is again liberated by surrendering to the Lord. The wordaàça, or "part and parcel" is also mentioned in Bhagavad-gétä (15.7):mamaiväàço jéva-loke jéva-bhütaù sanätanaù. The living entity is aàça, or aminute particle, and therefore subject to liberation and bondage. As stated in the Viñëu Puräëa:</div>

<div class="First">"The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu, possesses His superior internalpotency as well as the potency called kñetrajïä çakti. This kñetrajïä çakti is alsospiritual potency, but it is sometimes covered by the third, or material, potencycalled ignorance. Thus because of the various stages of covering, the second, ormarginal, potency is manifested in different evolutionary phases."Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura has written that the living entity has beenexecuting fruitive activities since time immemorial. Thus his conditioned lifemay be called beginningless. Such conditioned life, however, is not endless,since the living entity may achieve liberation through the loving devotionalservice of the Lord. Since the living entity may acquire liberation, ÇrélaBhaktivinoda Öhäkura states that his liberated life begins at a certain pointbut is endless, because liberated life is understood to be eternal. In any case,one who has achieved the shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,Kåñëa, may be understood to be eternally liberated, since such a person hasentered into the eternal atmosphere of the spiritual sky. Since there is nomaterial time in the spiritual sky, one who has achieved his eternal spiritualbody on Lord Kåñëa's planet is not subject to the influence of time. His eternalblissful life with Kåñëa is not designated in terms of material past, present andfuture and is therefore called eternal liberation. Material time is conspicuousby its absence in the spiritual sky, and every living entity there is eternallyliberated, having attained the supreme situation. Such liberation can beachieved by vidyä, or perfect knowledge, which is understood in three phasescalled Brahman, Paramätmä and Bhagavän, as described inÇrémad-Bhägavatam. The ultimate phase of vidyä, or knowledge, is tounderstand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-gétä suchknowledge is called räja-vidyä, or the king of all knowledge, and it awards the supreme liberation.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The example of two birds in the same tree is given to illustrate the presencewithin the heart of the material body of both the individual soul and theSupersoul, the Personality of Godhead. Just as a bird makes a nest in a tree, theliving entity sits within the heart. The example is appropriate because the birdis always distinct from the tree. Similarly, both the individual soul and theSupersoul are distinct entities, separate from the temporary material body. Theword balena indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is satisfied byHis own internal potency, which consists of eternality, omniscience and bliss.As indicated by the word bhüyän, or "having superior existence," the SupremeLord is always in a superior position, whereas the living entity is sometimes inillusion and sometimes enlightened. The word balena indicates that the Lord isnever in darkness or ignorance, but is always full in His perfect, blissful consciousness.</div>
<div class="First">Thus, the Lord is niranna, or uninterested in the bitter fruits of materialactivities, whereas the ordinary conditioned soul busily consumes such bitterfruits, thinking them to be sweet. Ultimately, the fruit of all material endeavoris death, hut the living entity foolishly thinks material things will bring himpleasure. The word sakhäyau, or "two friends," is also significant. Our realfriend is Lord Kåñëa, who is situated within our heart. Only He knows ouractual needs, and only He can give us real happiness.Lord Kåñëa is so kind that He patiently sits in the heart, trying to guide theconditioned soul back home, back to Godhead. Certainly no material friendwould remain with his foolish companion for millions of years, especially if hiscompanion were to ignore him or even curse him. But Lord Kåñëa is such afaithful, loving friend that He accompanies even the most demoniac livingentity and is also in the heart of the insect, pig and dog. That is because LordKåñëa is supremely Kåñëa conscious and sees every living entity as part andparcel of Himself. Every living being should give up the bitter fruits of the treeof material existence. One should turn one's face to the Lord within the heartand revive one's eternal loving relationship with one's real friend, Lord Kåñëa.The word sadåçau, or "of similar nature," indicates that both the living entityand the Personality of Godhead are conscious entities. As part and parcel ofthe Lord we share the Lord's nature, but in infinitesimal quantity. Thus theLord and the living entity are sadåçau.

<div class="First">The word vidyä-maya in this verse indicates the internal potency of theLord and not the external potency, mahä-mäyä. Within the material worldthere is vidyä, or material science, and avidyä, or material ignorance, but inthis verse vidyä means the internal spiritual knowledge by which thePersonality of Godhead is fixed in omniscience. The example of two birds in atree, which is given in many Vedic literatures, demonstrates the statementnityo nityänäm: there are two categories of eternal living entities, namely theSupreme Lord and the minute jéva soul. The conditioned jéva soul, forgettinghis identity as an eternal servant of the Lord, tries to enjoy the fruits of hisown activities and thus comes under the spell of ignorance. This bondage ofignorance has existed since time immemorial and can be rectified only by one'staking to the loving devotional service of the Lord, which is full of spiritualknowledge. In conditioned life the living entity is forced by the laws of natureto engage in pious and impious fruitive activities, but the liberated position ofevery living entity is to offer the fruits of his work to the Lord, the supremeenjoyer. It should be understood that even when the living entity is in aliberated condition, his knowledge is never equal in quantity to that of thePersonality of Godhead. Even Lord Brahmä, the supreme living entity withinthis universe, acquires only partial knowledge of the Personality of Godheadand His potencies.

In the kingdom of mäyä the living entity is bound to the cruellaws of birth and death, whereas in the spiritual sky the living entity is fixed ina bond of love to the Lord. Liberation means freedom from the miseries of life,but never freedom from one's loving relationship with Lord Kåñëa, which isthe essence of one's eternal existence. According to Çréla Madhväcärya, theLord is the only eternally free living entity, and all other living entities areeternally dependent and bound to the Lord, either through blissful lovingservice or through the bondage of mäyä. The conditioned soul should give uptasting the bitter fruits of the tree of material existence and turn to hisdearmost friend, Lord Kåñëa, who is sitting within his heart.

In this and thenext nine verses, the Lord describes the different symptoms of liberated andconditioned jéva souls. In a dream one sees oneself in an imaginary body, butupon waking one gives up all identification with that body. Similarly, one whohas awakened to Kåñëa consciousness no longer identifies with the gross orsubtle material bodies, nor does he become affected by the happiness anddistress of material life. On the other hand, a foolish person (kumati) does notawaken from the dream of material existence and is afflicted with innumerableproblems due to false identification with the gross and subtle material bodies.One should become situated in one's eternal spiritual identity (nitya-svarüpa).By properly identifying oneself as the eternal servant of Kåñëa, one becomesrelieved of his false material identity, and therefore the miseries of illusoryexistence immediately cease, just as the anxiety of a troublesome dream ceasesas soon as one awakens to his normal, pleasant surroundings. It should beunderstood, however, that the analogy of awakening from a dream can neverbe applied to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is never in illusion.The Lord is eternally awake and enlightened in His own unique categorycalled viñëu-tattva.

<div class="Translation"> An enlightened person who is free from the contamination of material desire does not consider himself to be the performer of bodily activities; rather, he knows that in all such activities it is only the senses, born of the modes of nature, that are contacting sense objects born of the same modes of nature.</div>

They are meant for my pleasure."Similarly, if the body performs a wonderful activity, a Kåñëa conscious persondoes not become proud, nor is he depressed by the failure of the body tofunction in a particular way. In other words, Kåñëa consciousness means givingup identification with the gross and subtle material bodies. One should seethem as the external energy of the Lord, working under the direction of theLord's empowered representative mäyä. One absorbed in fruitive activitiesworks under the jurisdiction of mahä-mäyä, or the external illusory potency,and experiences the miseries of material existence. On the other hand, adevotee works under the internal potency, called yoga-mäyä, and remainssatisfied by offering his loving service to the Lord. In either case, the LordHimself, by His multifarious potencies, is the ultimate performer of action.According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, one who claims to betranscendental to the bodily concept of life, but at the same time remainsunder the influence of material desire and mental transformation, isunderstood to be a cheater and the lowest type of conditioned soul.</div>

<div class="Translation"> An enlightened person fixed in detachment engages his body in lying down, sitting, walking, bathing, seeing, touching, smelling, eating, hearing and so on, but is never entangled by such activities.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the previous chapter, Uddhava asked Lord Kåñëa why an enlightenedperson, just like a conditioned soul, engages in external bodily functions. Hereis the Lord's answer. While engaged in bodily functions, an unintelligentperson is attached to both the means and end of material life and thereforeexperiences intense lamentation and jubilation on the material platform. Aself-realized soul, however, studies the inevitable defeat and suffering ofordinary persons and does not make the mistake of trying to enjoy the bodilyfunctions even slightly. He instead remains a detached witness, merelyengaging his senses in the normal functions of bodily maintenance. Asindicated here by the word ädayan, he engages something other than his actual self in material experience.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Although the sky, or space, is the resting place of everything, the sky does not mix with anything, nor is it entangled. Similarly, the sun is not at all attached to the water in which it is reflected within innumerable reservoirs, and the mighty wind blowing everywhere is not affected by the innumerable aromas and atmospheres through which it passes. In the same way, a self-realized soul is completely detached from the material body and the material world around it. He is like a person who has awakened and arisen from a dream. With expert vision sharpened by detachment, the self-realized soul cuts all doubts to pieces through knowledge of the self and completely withdraws his consciousness from the expansion of material variety.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, a self-realized soulcuts all doubts to pieces by direct experience of his true spiritual identity. TheSupreme Personality of Godhead is Lord Kåñëa, and there is no possibility ofany existence separate from Lord Kåñëa. Such expert knowledge cuts all doubtsto pieces. As stated here, prakåti-stho 'py asaàsaktaù: like the sky, the sun orthe wind, one who is self-realized is not entangled, though situated within thematerial creation of the Lord. Nänätva, or "material variety," refers to one'smaterial body, the bodies of others and the unlimited paraphernalia for bodilysense gratification, both physical and mental. By awakening to Kåñëaconsciousness, one completely retires from illusory sense gratification andbecomes absorbed in the progressive realization of the soul situated within thebody. As revealed in the example of the two birds in a tree, both the individualsoul and the Personality of Godhead are completely separate from the grossand subtle material bodies. If one turns one's face to the Lord, recognizingone's eternal dependence on Him, there will be no further suffering or anxiety,even though one is still situated within the material world. The unlimitedexperiences of material objects only increase one's anxiety, whereas perceptionof the Absolute Truth, Çré Kåñëa, immediately brings one to the platform ofpeace. Thus one who is intelligent retires from the world of matter andbecomes a fully self-realized Kåñëa conscious person.</div>

Just as Lord Kåñëaenlightened Arjuna, He now explains the same subject matter to Uddhava. Inthis verse the Lord describes symptoms by which it is very easy to recognize asaintly person, for a normal person becomes furious when criticized or attackedand overwhelmed with joy when glorified by others. There is a similarstatement by Yäjïavalkya to the effect that one who is actually intelligent doesnot become angry though pricked with thorns and does not become satisfied atheart merely by being worshiped with auspicious paraphernalia such as sandalwood.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, this verse describes a type of disciplinerecommended for the jïäna-yogés, who by intelligence try to understand thatthey are not their material bodies. One who is engaged in the devotionalservice of the Lord, however, accepts and rejects material things in terms oftheir usefulness in the loving service of Lord Kåñëa. One who is trying topreach Kåñëa consciousness should be seen as very intelligent and not jaòa-vat,or stunted, as described here. Although a devotee of the Lord does not act,speak or contemplate for his personal sense gratification, he remains very busyworking, speaking and meditating in the devotional service of the Lord. Thedevotee makes elaborate plans to engage all the fallen souls in Lord Kåñëa'sservice so they can be purified and go back home, back to Godhead. Merelyrejecting material things is not perfect consciousness. One must see everythingas the property of the Lord and meant for the Lord's pleasure. One busilyengaged in spreading the Kåñëa consciousness movement has no time to makematerial distinctions and thus automatically comes to the liberated platform.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> If through meticulous study one becomes expert in reading Vedic literature but makes no endeavor to fix one's mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then one's endeavor is certainly like that of a man who works very hard to take care of a cow that gives no milk. In other words, the fruit of one's laborious study of Vedic knowledge will simply be the labor itself. There will be no other tangible result.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains that the word pare ("theSupreme") in this verse indicates the Supreme Personality of Godhead ratherthan the impersonal Brahman, because Lord Kåñëa, the speaker of theseinstructions, makes references in later verses to His personality as theSupreme. An impersonal interpretation in this case would be eka-deçänvayauttara-çlokärtha-tätparya-virodhaù, or a contradictory interpretation thatcreates illogical conflict with other çlokas (verses) spoken in the same context.It requires great endeavor to take care of a cow. One must either grow foodgrains to feed the cow or maintain suitable pastures. If the pasture is notproperly maintained, poisonous weeds will grow, or snakes will multiply, andthere will be danger. Cows are infected by many types of diseases and bugs andmust be regularly cleaned and disinfected. Similarly, fences must bemaintained around the cow pasture, and there is even more work to be done. Ifthe cow gives no milk, however, then one certainly performs hard labor withno tangible result. Laborious effort is also required to learn the Sanskritlanguage well enough to discern the subtle and esoteric meaning of the Vedicmantras. If after such great labor one does not understand the spiritual body ofthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, which is the source of all happiness inlife, and if one does not surrender to the Lord as the supreme shelter of allthings, then one has certainly labored hard with no tangible result other thanhis own labor. Even a liberated soul who has given up the bodily concept of lifewill fall down if he does not take shelter of the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. The word niñëäta, or "expert," indicates that one must ultimatelyachieve the goal of life; otherwise one is not expert. As stated by CaitanyaMahäprabhu, premä pum-artho mahän: the actual goal of human life is love ofGodhead, and no one can be considered expert without achieving this goal.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear Uddhava, that man is certainly most miserable who takes care of a cow that gives no milk, an unchaste wife, a body totally dependent on others, useless children or wealth not utilized for the right purpose. Similarly, one who studies Vedic knowledge devoid of My glories is also most miserable.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">A human being is actually learned or expert when he understands that allmaterial objects perceived through the various senses are expansions of theSupreme Personality of Godhead and that nothing exists without the supportof the Supreme Lord. In this verse, through various examples, it is concludedthat the power of speech is useless if not engaged in the support of theSupreme Lord. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, this verseimplies that all of the functions of the various senses are useless if they are notengaged in the glorification of God. Indeed, the avadhüta brähmaëa previouslystated to King Yadu that if the tongue is not controlled, one's entire programof sense control is a failure. One cannot control the tongue unless he vibrates the glories of the Lord.</div>
<div class="First">The example of the milkless cow is significant. A gentleman never kills acow, and therefore when a cow becomes sterile and no longer gives milk, onemust engage in the laborious task of protecting her, since no one will purchasea useless cow. For some time, the greedy owner of a sterile cow may continuethinking, "I have already invested so much money in taking care of this cow,and certainly in the near future she will again become pregnant and give milk."But when this hope is proven futile, he becomes neglectful and indifferent tothe health and safety of the animal. Because of such sinful neglect, he mustsuffer in the next life, after having already suffered because of the sterile cow in the present life.</div>
<div class="First">Similarly, although a man may discover that his wife is neither chaste noraffectionate, he may be so eager to get children that he goes on taking care ofsuch a useless wife, thinking, "I will teach my wife the religious duties of achaste woman. By hearing historical examples of great women surely her heartwill change, and she will become a wonderful wife to me." Unfortunately, theunchaste wife in many cases does not change and also gives a man manyuseless children who are just as foolish and irreligious as she. Such childrennever give any happiness to the father, yet the father tediously labors to take care of them.</div>
<div class="First">Also, one who has accumulated wealth by the mercy of God must bevigilant to give in charity to the right person and for the right cause. If such aright person or cause appears and one hesitates and selfishly does not give incharity, one loses his reputation, and in the next life he will bepoverty-stricken. One who fails to give properly in charity spends his lifeanxiously protecting his wealth, which ultimately brings him no fame or happiness.</div>
<div class="First">The previous examples are given to illustrate the uselessness of laboriouslystudying Vedic knowledge that does not glorify the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé comments that the spiritual vibration of theVedas is meant to bring one to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa.Many processes for achieving the Supreme Truth are recommended in theUpaniñads and other Vedic literatures, but because of their innumerable andseemingly contradictory explanations, commentaries and injunctions, onecannot achieve the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, merely byreading such literature. If, however, one understands Çré Kåñëa to be theultimate cause of all causes and reads the Upaniñads and other Vedic literatureas glorification of the Supreme Lord, then one can actually become fixed atthe Lord's lotus feet. For example, His Divine Grace Çréla Prabhupädatranslated and commented upon Çré Éçopaniñad in such a way that it brings thereader closer to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Undoubtedly, the lotusfeet of Lord Kåñëa are the only reliable boat by which to cross the turbulentocean of material existence. Even Lord Brahmä has stated in the Tenth Cantoof Çrémad-Bhägavatam that if one gives up the auspicious path of bhakti andtakes to the fruitless labor of Vedic speculation, one is just like a fool who beatsempty husks in hopes of getting rice. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé recommends that onecompletely ignore dry Vedic speculation because it does not bring one to thepoint of devotional service to the Absolute Truth, Lord Çré Kåñëa.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The words lélävatärepsita-janma are very significant here. The Lord'sincarnation for executing wonderful pastimes is called lélävatära, and suchwonderful forms of Viñëu are glorified by the names Rämacandra,Nåsiàhadeva, Kürma, Varäha, and so on. Among all such lélävatäras, however,the most beloved, even to this day, is Lord Kåñëa, the original source of theviñëu-tattva. The Lord appears in the prison house of Kaàsa and isimmediately transferred to the rural setting of Våndävana, where He exhibitsunique childhood pastimes with His cowherd boyfriends, girl friends, parentsand well-wishers. After some time, the Lord's pastimes are transferred toMathurä and Dvärakä, and the extraordinary love of the inhabitants ofVåndävana is exhibited in their anguished separation from Lord Kåñëa. Suchpastimes of the Lord are épsita, or the reservoir of all loving exchanges with theAbsolute Truth. The pure devotees of the Lord are most intelligent and expertand do not pay any attention to useless, fruitless literatures that neglect thehighest truth, Lord Kåñëa. Although such literatures are very popular amongmaterialistic persons all over the world, they are completely neglected by thecommunity of pure Vaiñëavas. In this verse the Lord explains that theliteratures approved for the devotees are those that glorify the Lord's pastimesas the puruña-avatära and the lélävatäras, culminating in the personalappearance of Lord Kåñëa Himself, as confirmed in Brahma-saàhitä (5.39):</div>

<div class="First">Although in previous verses Lord Kåñëa has described the life-style andapproach of the impersonal philosophers who meditate on the distinctionbetween matter and spirit, the Lord here rejects the path of jïäna, orspeculation, and comes to the final conclusion, bhakti-yoga. The path of jïänais interesting only to one who does not know that Lord Kåñëa is the SupremePersonality of Godhead, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä (7.19):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bahünäà janmanäm ante</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">jïänavän mäm prapadyate</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">väsudevaù sarvam iti</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sa mahätmä su-durlabhaù</div>
<div class="First">The words väsudevaù sarvam iti, or "Väsudeva is everything," are similar to thewords sarva-ge found in this verse. One should know why the Personality ofGodhead is all-pervading. The first verse of Çrémad-Bhägavatam states,janmädy asya yataù: [SB 1.1.1] the Supreme Lord is the source of everything.And as stated in the previous verse of this chapter, He creates, maintains andannihilates everything. Thus the Lord is not all-pervading in the manner of airor sunlight; rather, the Lord is all-pervading as the absolute controller whoholds in His hands the destiny of every living entity.Everything is ultimately an expansion of Kåñëa, and therefore there isreally no other object of meditation besides Kåñëa. Meditation upon any otherobject is also meditation on Kåñëa but is imperfectly performed, as confirmedin Bhagavad-gétä by the word avidhi-pürvakam. The Lord also states in the Gétäthat all living entities are on the path back home, back to Godhead. Because ofignorance, however, some of them go backward or stop along the way, foolishlythinking that their journey is finished, when in fact they are suspended in oneof the minor potencies of the Supreme Lord. If one wants to intimatelyunderstand the nature of the Absolute Truth, one must take to the path of love of Godhead. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (18.55):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yävän yaç cäsmi tattvataù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tato mäà tattvato jïätvä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">viçate tad-anantaram</div>
<div class="First">"One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotionalservice. And when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God."</div>
<div class="First">The words nänätva-bhramam in this verse indicate false identification withthe gross and subtle material bodies. The word bhramam indicates a mistake; itcan also mean "wandering" or "rotating." The conditioned living entity,because of his mistake of falling into illusion, is wandering through asuccession of material bodies, sometimes appearing as a demigod andsometimes as a worm in stool. The word upärameta means that one should stopsuch fruitless wandering and fix one's mind on the Absolute Truth, theSupreme Lord, who is the true object of everyone's love. Such a conclusion isnot sentimental but is the result of keen analytic intelligence (jijïäsayä). Thusafter elaborately explaining to Uddhava many aspects of analytic knowledge,the Lord now comes to the ultimate conclusion, Kåñëa consciousness, pure loveof Godhead. Without such love there is no question of eternally fixing one's mind on the Lord.</div>
<div class="First">Quoting from the Viveka, Çréla Madhväcärya states that nänätva-bhramamindicates the following illusions: considering the living entity to be theSupreme; considering all living entities to be ultimately one entity withoutseparate individuality; considering that there are many Gods; thinking thatKåñëa is not God; and considering that the material universe is the ultimatereality. All of these illusions are called bhrama, or mistakes, but such ignorancecan be eliminated at once by the chanting of the holy names of Kåñëa: HareKåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear Uddhava, if you are not able to free your mind from all material disturbance and thus absorb it completely on the spiritual platform, then perform all your activities as an offering to Me, without trying to enjoy the fruits.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">If one offers one's activities to Lord Kåñëa without trying to enjoy theresults, one's mind becomes purified. When the mind is purified,transcendental knowledge automatically manifests, since such knowledge is aby-product of pure consciousness. When the mind is absorbed in perfectknowledge, it can be raised to the spiritual platform, as described in Bhagavad-gétä (18.54):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">brahma-bhütaù prasannätmä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na çocati na känkñati</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">samaù sarveñu bhüteñu</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mad-bhaktià labhate paräm</div>
<div class="First">"One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the SupremeBrahman. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equallydisposed to every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional serviceunto Me." By absorbing the mind in the transcendental form of Lord Kåñëa,one can surpass the stage of ordinary transcendental knowledge, by which onesimply distinguishes oneself from the gross and subtle material bodies.Spiritually enriched by loving devotional service to the Lord, the mind iscompletely purified of all tinges of illusion. Through intense concentration onone's relationship with the Personality of Godhead one comes to the higheststandard of knowledge and becomes an intimate associate of the Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="First">By offering one's activities to the Personality of Godhead, one purifies one'smind to some extent and thus comes to the preliminary stage of spiritualawareness. Yet even then one may not be able to fix one's mind completely onthe spiritual platform. At that point one should realistically assess one'sposition, noting the lingering material contamination within the mind. Then,as stated in this verse, one should intensify one's practical devotional work inthe service of the Lord. If one artificially considers oneself to be supremelyliberated or if one becomes casual on the path of spiritual advancement, there is serious danger of a falldown.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the Lord previously explained to Uddhavajïäna-miçrä bhakti, or devotional service mixed with the impure desire to enjoytranscendental knowledge. In this verse the Lord clearly reveals thattranscendental knowledge is an automatic by-product of loving service to theLord, and in the next verse the Lord begins His explanation of pure devotionalservice, which is completely sufficient for self-realization. The desire to enjoyspiritual knowledge is certainly a material desire, since the goal is one'spersonal satisfaction and not the pleasure of the Supreme Lord. ThereforeLord Kåñëa here warns Uddhava that if one is not able to fix one's mind intrance on the spiritual platform, then one should not go on simplytheoretically discussing what is Brahman and what is not Brahman. Rather,one should engage in practical devotional service to the Supreme Lord, andthen spiritual knowledge will automatically awaken in one's heart. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (10.10):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">teñäà satata-yuktänäà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhajatäà préti-pürvakam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">dadämi buddhi-yogaà taà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yena mäm upayänti te</div>
<div class="First">"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me."</div>
<div class="First">Similarly, in the Tenth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam Lord Brahmä warnsthat one should not neglect the auspicious path of bhakti and instead take upthe useless labor of mental speculation. By mere philosophical speculation onecannot fix one's mind on the spiritual platform. Many great philosophersthroughout history had abominable personal habits, which proves that theycould not fix themselves on the spiritual platform by mere speculation onphilosophical categories. If one is not fortunate enough to have executeddevotional service to the Lord in one's past life, and if one is thereforeaddicted to mere speculation on the differences between matter and spirit, onewill not be able to fix one's mind on the spiritual platform. Such a personshould give up useless speculation and engage in the practical work of Kåñëaconsciousness, absorbing himself twenty-four hours a day in the mission of theSupreme Personality of Godhead. In such missionary work for the Lord's sake,one should never try to enjoy the fruits of one's work. Even though the mind isnot completely pure, if one offers the fruits of one's work to the Lord, the mindwill quickly come to the standard of pure desirelessness, in which one's only desire is the Lord's satisfaction.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Jéva Gosvämé states that if one does not have faith in the personalform and activities of the Personality of Godhead, one will not have thespiritual strength to remain perpetually on the transcendental platform. In thisverse the Lord is definitely bringing Uddhava, and all living entities, to theconclusion of all philosophy—pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa.</div>
<div class="First">In this regard, Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura points out that onewho is bewildered by false ego may not want to offer his activities to theSupreme Personality of Godhead, even though this is the actual way of risingabove the influence of the modes of material nature. Because of ignorance onedoes not know that he is the eternal servant of Kåñëa and instead is attractedby the duality of material illusion. One cannot become free from such illusionby theoretical speculation, but if one offers one's work to the Personality ofGodhead, one will clearly understand his eternal, transcendental position as a servant of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear Uddhava, narrations of My pastimes and qualities are all-auspicious and purify the entire universe. A faithful person who constantly hears, glorifies and remembers such transcendental activities, who through dramatic performances relives My pastimes, beginning with My appearance, and who takes full shelter of Me, dedicating his religious, sensual and occupational activities for My satisfaction, certainly obtains unflinching devotional service to Me, the eternal Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Those who have faith only in the impersonal effulgent aspect of theSupreme Lord and those who have faith only in the localized Supersoul, theperfect object of mystic meditation located in the heart of every living entity,are considered to be limited and imperfect in their transcendental realization.The process of mystic meditation and impersonal philosophical speculation areboth devoid of actual love of God and therefore cannot be considered to be theperfection of human life. Only one who places full faith in the SupremePersonality of Godhead becomes qualified to go back home, back to Godhead.Lord Kåñëa's pastimes of stealing butter from the elderly gopés, enjoying lifewith His cowherd boyfriends and the young gopés, playing His flute andengaging in the räsa dance, etc., are all-auspicious spiritual activities, and theyare fully described in the Tenth Canto of this work. There are manyauthorized songs and prayers glorifying these pastimes of the Lord, and byconstantly chanting them one will automatically be fixed in smaraëam, orremembrance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord exhibited Hisopulences upon His birth in Kaàsa's prison and at the birth ceremonysubsequently performed by Nanda Mahäräja in Gokula. The Lord furtherperformed many adventurous activities, such as chastising the serpent Käliyaand many other irresponsible demons. One should regularly take part in theceremonies commemorating Kåñëa's pastimes, such as the Janmäñöamécelebration glorifying the Lord's birth. On such days one should worship theDeity of Lord Kåñëa and the spiritual master and thus remember the Lord's pastimes.</div>
<div class="First">The word dharma in this verse indicates that one's religious activitiesshould always be in connection with Kåñëa. Therefore, one should give charityin the form of food grains, clothing, etc., to the Vaiñëavas and brähmaëas, andwhenever possible one should arrange for the protection of cows, who are verydear to the Lord. The word käma indicates that one should satisfy one's desireswith the transcendental paraphernalia of the Lord. One should eatmahä-prasädam, food offered to the Deity of Lord Kåñëa, and one should alsodecorate oneself with the Lord's flower garlands and sandalwood pulp andshould place the remnants of the Deity's clothing on one's body. One who livesin a luxurious mansion or apartment should convert his residence into atemple of Lord Kåñëa and invite others to come, chant before the Deity, hearBhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam and taste the remnants of the Lord'sfood, or one may live in a beautiful temple building in the community ofVaiñëavas and engage in the same activities. The word artha in this verseindicates that one who is inclined toward business should accumulate moneyto promote the missionary work of the Lord's devotees and not for one'spersonal sense gratification. Thus one's business activities are also consideredto be devotional service to Lord Kåñëa. The word niçcaläm indicates that sinceLord Kåñëa is eternally fixed in perfect knowledge and bliss, there is nopossibility of disturbance for one who worships the Lord. If we worshipanything except the Lord, our worship may be disturbed when our worshipabledeity is placed in an awkward position. But because the Lord is supreme, our worship of Him is eternally free of disturbance.</div>
<div class="First">One who engages in hearing, glorifying, remembering and dramaticallyrecreating the pastimes of the Lord will soon be freed from all material desire.Çréla Jéva Gosvämé mentions in this connection that one who is advanced inKåñëa consciousness may specifically be attracted to the pastimes of a devoteein the spiritual world who serves the Lord in a particular way. An advanceddevotee in this world may desire to serve the Lord in the same way and thusmay take pleasure in dramatically reliving the service of his worshipabledevotee-master in the spiritual world. Also, one may take pleasure in spiritualfestivals, performances of particular pastimes of Lord Kåñëa, or activities ofother devotees of the Lord. In this way, one can continually increase one'sfaith in the Personality of Godhead. Those who have no desire to hear, glorifyor remember the transcendental activities of the Lord are certainly materiallypolluted and never achieve the highest perfection. Such persons spoil theopportunity of human life by devoting themselves to fleeting mundane topicsthat produce no eternal benefit. The real meaning of religion is to constantlyserve the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose form is eternal, full of blissand knowledge. One who has taken full shelter of the Lord is completelyuninterested in impersonal speculations about the nature of God and uses histime to advance more and more in the unlimited bliss of pure devotional service.</div>

<div class="Translation"> One who has obtained pure devotional service by association with My devotees always engages in worshiping Me. Thus he very easily goes to My abode, which is revealed by My pure devotees.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the previous verses Lord Kåñëa has emphasized the value of surrenderingto Him in loving service. One may ask how such surrender or devotion isactually achieved. The Lord gives the answer in this verse. One must live in asociety of devotees, and thus automatically one will be engaged twenty-fourhours a day in the various processes of devotional service, beginning withçravaëam, kértanam and smaraëam (hearing, glorifying and remembering theLord) [SB 7.5.23]. The pure devotees of the Lord can reveal the spiritual worldby their transcendental sound vibration, making it possible for even aneophyte devotee to experience the Lord's abode. Being thus enlivened, theneophyte makes further progress and gradually becomes qualified to personallyserve the Personality of Godhead in the spiritual world. By constantlyassociating with devotees and learning from them about devotional science,one quickly achieves a deep attachment for the Lord and the Lord's service,and such attachment gradually matures into pure love of Godhead.Foolish persons say that the various mantras composed of names of God, aswell as all other mantras, are merely material creations with no special value,and therefore any so-called mantra or mystical process will ultimately producethe same result. To refute such superficial thinking, the Lord here describesthe science of going back home, back to Godhead. One should not accept thebad association of impersonalists, who state that the holy name, form, qualitiesand pastimes of the Lord are mäyä, or illusion. Mäyä is actually aninsignificant potency of the almighty Personality of Godhead, and if oneignorantly tries to elevate illusion above the Absolute Truth, one will neverexperience love of Godhead and will be cast into deep forgetfulness of theLord. One should not associate with those who are envious of the fortunatedevotees who are going back to Godhead. Such envious persons deride theabode of the Lord, which is revealed by the pure devotees to those who havefaith in the Lord's message. Envious persons create disturbances among thepeople in general, who should take shelter of the faithful devotees of the Lord.Unless people hear from pure devotees, it is impossible for them to understandthat there is a Supreme Personality of Godhead eternally existing in His ownabode, which is self-luminous, full of bliss and knowledge. In this verse, theimportance of saìga, association, is clearly explained.</div>

Therefore please explain this to me.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the previous verse it was stated that one can achieve the Lord's supremeabode by associating with devotees. Therefore, Uddhava naturally inquiresabout the symptoms of a distinguished devotee whose association can promoteone to the kingdom of God. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé notes that the Personality ofGodhead knows who is actually a sincere devotee because the Lord is alwaysattached to His loving servitors. Similarly, pure devotees can expertly explainthe proper methods of devotional service to Lord Kåñëa because they arealready absorbed in love of Kåñëa. Uddhava herein requests Lord Kåñëa todescribe the qualities of a devotee and asks the Lord to explain the devotionalservice that the devotees themselves approve as worthy to be offered to the Lord.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura remarks that the word puruñädhyakñaindicates that Lord Kåñëa is the supreme ruler of the universal controllersheaded by Mahä-Viñëu, and thus the Lord possesses infinite sovereignty. Theterm lokädhyakña indicates that Lord Kåñëa is the ultimate supervisingauthority of all of the Vaikuëöha planets, and therefore the Lord is unlimitedlyglorious and perfect. Uddhava further addresses Lord Kåñëa as jagat-prabhu,because even in the illusory material world the Lord exhibits His unlimitedmercy by personally incarnating to uplift the conditioned souls. The wordpraëatäya ("Your surrendered devotee") indicates that Uddhava is not proudlike ordinary fools who do not enjoy bowing down to the Supreme Personalityof Godhead. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, Uddhavamentions that he is anuraktäya, or completely bound in love to Lord Kåñëa,because unlike other great devotees such as Arjuna, who sometimes worshipeddemigods in order to comply with social customs or to show respect for theirpositions in the scheme of planetary management, Uddhava never worshipedany demigods. Therefore, Uddhava is prapannäya, or completely surrendered to Lord Kåñëa, having no other shelter.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The pure devotees of the Lord propagate devotional service all over theworld, and therefore, although separate from the personal form of the Lord,they are considered to be manifestations of God's mercy and potency. Asstated in Caitanya-caritämåta (Antya 7.11): kåñëa-çakti vinä nahe tära pravartana.</div>
<div class="First">The Lord is like the sky (vyoma) because although expanded everywhere,He is not entangled in anything. He is prakåteù paraù, or completelytranscendental to material nature. The Lord is fully self-satisfied and istherefore indifferent to the affairs of the material world. Still, because of Hiscauseless mercy, the Lord desires to expand pure devotional service, and forthis reason He incarnates within the material world to uplift the fallen conditioned souls.</div>
<div class="First">The Lord descends in selected spiritual bodies to please His loving devotees.Sometimes He appears in His original form as Kåñëa. And even Kåñëa Himselfappears in different forms to special devotees so that they may fully developtheir loving sentiments for Him. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé gives several examples ofthe Lord's special mercy upon His devotees. Lord Kåñëa personally went to thehome of Jämbavän and there displayed a form with slightly angry glances. Inthat form, the Lord enjoyed a fight with His devotee. The Lord displayed Hisform as Dattätreya to Atri Muni and similarly bestowed special mercy uponLord Brahmä, the demigods, Akrüra and innumerable other devotees. And inVåndävana the Lord displayed His most beautiful form as Govinda to the fortunate inhabitants.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted from the Prakäça-saàhitä as follows. "TheLord accepts different spiritual bodies according to the desire of His devotees.For example, the Lord agreed to become the son of Vasudeva and Devaké.Thus, although Lord Kåñëa has an eternal, blissful spiritual form, He appears toenter within the body of His devotee who becomes His mother. Although wespeak of the Lord's 'taking on a body,' the Lord does not change His form, as dothe conditioned souls, who must change their material bodies. The Lordappears in His own eternally unchangeable forms. Lord Hari always appears inthe forms that are especially desired by His loving devotees, and never in otherforms. However, if one thinks that the Lord, in the manner of an ordinaryperson taking birth, becomes the physical son of Vasudeva or other devotees,then one is victimized by illusion. The Lord merely expands His spiritualpotency, causing His pure devotees to think, 'Kåñëa is now my son.' One shouldunderstand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead never accepts or rejectsa material body, nor does He ever give up His eternal spiritual forms; rather,the Lord eternally manifests His blissful bodies according to the loving sentiments of His eternal pure devotees."</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Jéva Gosvämé mentions that the word vyoma also indicates the Lord'sname of Paravyoma, or the Lord of the spiritual sky. One should notmisinterpret this verse to mean that Lord Kåñëa is impersonal, like thematerial sky, or that the form of Kåñëa is merely another selected incarnationequal to any other. Such casual and whimsical speculations cannot be acceptedas actual spiritual knowledge. Çré Kåñëa is the original Personality of Godhead(kåñëas tu bhagavän svayam [SB 1.3.28]), and the Lord has explainedelaborately in Bhagavad-gétä that He is the original source of everything.Therefore, the pure devotees of the Lord are eternally engaged, in fullknowledge and bliss, in loving service to the Lord's original form as Kåñëa. Thewhole purpose of Çrémad-Bhägavatam is to arouse our love for Lord Kåñëa, andone should not foolishly misunderstand this great purpose.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: O Uddhava, a saintly person is merciful and never injures others. Even if others are aggressive he is tolerant and forgiving toward all living entities. His strength and meaning in life come from the truth itself, he is free from all envy and jealousy, and his mind is equal in material happiness and distress. Thus, he dedicates his time to work for the welfare of all others. His intelligence is never bewildered by material desires, and he has controlled his senses. His behavior is always pleasing, never harsh and always exemplary, and he is free from possessiveness. He never endeavors in ordinary, worldly activities, and he strictly controls his eating. He therefore always remains peaceful and steady. A saintly person is thoughtful and accepts Me as his only shelter. Such a person is very cautious in the execution of his duties and is never subject to superficial transformations, because he is steady and noble, even in a distressing situation. He has conquered over the six material qualities—namely hunger, thirst, lamentation, illusion, old age and death. He is free from all desire for prestige and offers honor to others. He is expert in reviving the Kåñëa consciousness of others and therefore never cheats anyone. Rather, he is a well-wishing friend to all, being most merciful. Such a saintly person must be considered the most learned of men. He perfectly understands that the ordinary religious duties prescribed by Me in various Vedic scriptures possess favorable qualities that purify the performer, and he knows that neglect of such duties constitutes a discrepancy in one's life. Having taken complete shelter at My lotus feet, however, a saintly person ultimately renounces such ordinary religious duties and worships Me alone. He is thus considered to be the best among all living entities.</div>

<div class="First">Verses 29-31 describe twenty-eight qualities of a saintly person, and verse 32explains the highest perfection of life. According to Çréla BhaktisiddhäntaSarasvaté Öhäkura, the seventeenth quality (mat-çaraëa, or taking completeshelter of Lord Kåñëa) is the most important, and the other twenty-sevenqualities automatically appear in one who has become a pure devotee of theLord. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (5.18.12), yasyästi bhaktir bhagavatyakiïcanä sarvair guëais tatra samäsate suräù. The twenty-eight saintly qualities may be described as follows.</div>
<div class="First">(1) Kåpälu. A devotee cannot tolerate seeing the world merged in ignoranceand suffering the whiplashes of mäyä. Therefore he busily engages indistributing Kåñëa consciousness and is called kåpälu, or merciful.(2) Akåta-droha. Even if someone is offensive toward a devotee, a devoteedoes not become offensive in return. Indeed, he never acts against the interestof any living entity. One may argue that great Vaiñëava kings, such asMahäräja Yudhiñöhira and Parékñit Mahäräja, executed many criminals.However, when justice is properly administered by the state, sinful, destructivepersons actually benefit from their punishment because they become freedfrom the severe karmic reactions to their illicit activities. A Vaiñëava rulergives punishment not out of envy or malice, but in faithful obedience to thelaws of God. The Mäyävädé philosophers who want to kill God by imaginingthat He does not exist are certainly kåta-droha, or most injurious to themselvesand others. The impersonalist imagines that he himself is supreme and thuscreates a most dangerous situation for himself and his followers. Similarly, thekarmés, who are dedicated to material sense gratification, are also killers of theself, because by their absorption in material consciousness they lose all chanceof experiencing the Absolute Truth and the truth of their own self. Therefore,all living entities who come under the control of materialistic regulations andduties are unnecessarily harassing themselves and others, and a pure Vaiñëavafeels great compassion and concern for them. A devotee never uses his mind,body or words to perform any act harmful to the welfare of any living entity.(3) Titikñu. A devotee forgives and forgets any offense against himself. AVaiñëava is personally detached from his material body, which is made of pus,stool, blood, and so on. Therefore the devotee is able to overlook theobnoxious behavior he sometimes meets with in the course of preaching workand always deals with people as a perfect gentleman. A Vaiñëava loudly chantsthe holy name of the Lord and tolerates and forgives those fallen conditionedsouls who are unable to reciprocate properly with a pure devotee.(4) Satya-sära. A devotee always remembers that he is the eternal servantof the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is omniscient, the reservoir of allpleasure and the ultimate enjoyer of all activities. By avoiding activitiesoutside devotional service, a devotee remains fixed in the truth, does notuselessly waste time and thus becomes bold, powerful and steady.(5) Anavadyätmä. A devotee knows that the material world is a temporaryphantasmagoria and therefore does not envy anyone in any material situation.He never tries to agitate others or criticize them unnecessarily.(6) Sama. A devotee remains steady and equal in material happiness ordistress, fame or infamy. His actual wealth is his consciousness of Kåñëa, andhe understands that his real self-interest lies outside the scope of materialnature. He does not become excited or depressed by external events, butremains fixed in consciousness of the omnipotency of Lord Kåñëa.(7) Sarvopakäraka. Neglecting one's selfish desires and working for thesatisfaction of others is called paropakära, whereas causing trouble to othersfor one's personal gratification is called paräpakära. A devotee always worksfor the pleasure of Lord Kåñëa, who is the resting place of all living entities,and thus a devotee's activities are ultimately pleasing to everyone. Devotionalservice to Lord Kåñëa is the perfectional stage of welfare work, since LordKåñëa is the supreme controller of everyone's happiness and distress. Foolishpersons under the influence of false egotism, considering themselves to be theultimate well-wishers of others, execute superficial materialistic activitiesrather than attending to the eternal happiness of others. Because a devoteeremains pure and engages in missionary activities, he is everyone's best friend.(8) Kämair ahata-dhé. Ordinary persons see all material things as objects fortheir personal gratification and thus try to acquire or control them. Ultimatelya man wants to possess a woman and enjoy sex gratification with her. TheSupreme Lord supplies the desired fuel that causes the fire of lust to burnpainfully in one's heart, but the Lord does not give self-realization to such amisguided person. Lord Kåñëa is transcendental and neutral, but if one is eagerto exploit the Lord's creation, the Lord gives one facility through mäyä, andone becomes cheated of real happiness by entangling himself in the false roleof a great and lusty enjoyer of the world. On the other hand, one who hastaken full shelter of Kåñëa is enriched with perfect knowledge and bliss and isnot cheated by the seductive appearances of the material world. A puredevotee does not follow the path of the foolish deer, which is seduced by thehunter's horn and killed. A devotee is never attracted by the sensuousentreaties of a beautiful woman, and he avoids hearing from bewildered karmésabout the so-called glories of material acquisition. Similarly, a pure devotee isnot bewildered by aroma or taste. He does not become attached to sumptuouseating, nor does he spend the whole day making arrangements for bodilycomfort. The only actual enjoyer of God's creation is the Lord Himself, andthe living entities are secondary enjoyers who experience unlimited pleasurethrough the Lord's pleasure. This perfect process of experiencing pleasure iscalled bhakti-yoga, or pure devotional service, and a devotee never sacrificeshis auspicious position of steady intelligence, even in the face of so-called material opportunity.</div>
<div class="First">(9) Dänta. A devotee is naturally repelled by sinful activities and controlshis senses by dedicating all his acts to Kåñëa. This requires steady concentration and a cautious mentality.</div>
<div class="First">(lo) Mådu. A materialistic person will always see people as friends orenemies and thus will sometimes justify cruel or small-minded behavior inorder to subdue his opponents. Since a devotee has taken shelter of LordKåñëa, he does not consider anyone his enemy and is never disturbed by thetendency to desire or enjoy the suffering of others. Thus he is mådu, or gentle and sublime.</div>
<div class="First">(11) Çuci. A devotee never touches that which is impure or improper, andsimply by remembering such a pure devotee, one is freed from the tendency tosin. Because of his perfect behavior, a devotee is called çuci, or pure.(12) Akiïcana. A devotee is free from possessiveness and is not eager toenjoy or renounce anything, since he considers everything to be Lord Kåñëa's property.</div>
<div class="First">(13) Anéha. A devotee never acts on his own behalf, but rather for theservice of Lord Kåñëa. He is therefore aloof from ordinary, worldly affairs.(14) Mita-bhuk. A devotee accepts material sense objects only as far asnecessary, to keep himself healthy and fit in Lord Kåñëa's service. He istherefore not entangled by his sense activities and never injures hisself-realization. When necessary, a devotee can give up anything for LordKåñëa's service, but he does not accept or reject anything for his personal prestige.</div>
<div class="First">(15) Çänta. Those trying to exploit the Lord's creation are always disturbed.A devotee, however, is detached from such pointless activities and understandssense gratification to be diametrically opposed to his self-interest. Being alwaysengaged according to the Lord's desire, he remains peaceful.(16) Sthira. Remembering that Lord Kåñëa is the basis of everything, a devotee does not become fearful or impatient.</div>
<div class="First">(17) Mat-çaraëa. A devotee does not take pleasure in anything exceptserving Lord Kåñëa and is constantly attentive in the execution of his duties.A devotee knows that only Lord Kåñëa can protect him and engage him in useful work.</div>
<div class="First">(18) Muni. A devotee is thoughtful and through intelligent contemplationavoids becoming distracted from his spiritual advancement. By intelligence heis freed from doubts about Lord Kåñëa and confronts all problems in life with steady Kåñëa consciousness.</div>
<div class="First">(19) Apramatta. One who forgets the Supreme Lord is more or less crazy,but a devotee remains sane by offering his activities to Lord Kåñëa.(20) Gabhérätmä. As a devotee merges into the ocean of Kåñëaconsciousness, his own consciousness becomes deeper and deeper; ordinary,superficial persons hovering on the material platform cannot fathom the extent of a devotee's awareness.</div>
<div class="First">(21) Dhåtimän. By controlling the urges of the tongue and genitals thedevotee remains steady and patient and does not impulsively change his position.</div>
<div class="First">(22) Jita-ñaò-guëa. By spiritual knowledge, a devotee is able to conquer thepushings of hunger, thirst, lamentation, illusion, old age and death.(23) Amäné. A devotee is not puffed up, and even if he is famous, he does not take such fame very seriously.</div>
<div class="First">(24) Mäna-da. A devotee offers all respects to others, since everyone is part and parcel of Lord Kåñëa.</div>
<div class="First">(25) Kalya. A devotee is expert in making people understand the truth of Kåñëa consciousness.</div>
<div class="First">(26) Maitra. A devotee does not cheat anyone by encouraging them in thebodily concept of life; rather, by his missionary work a devotee is the true friend of everyone.</div>
<div class="First">(27) Käruëika. A devotee tries to make people sane and thus is mostmerciful. He is para-duùkha-duùkhé, or one who is unhappy to see the unhappiness of others.</div>
<div class="First">(28) Kavi. A devotee is expert in studying the transcendental qualities ofLord Kåñëa and is able to show the harmony and compatibility of the Lord'sapparently contradictory qualities. This is possible through expert knowledgeof the absolute nature of the Lord. Lord Caitanya is softer than a rose andharder than a thunderbolt, but these opposing qualities can easily beunderstood in terms of the Lord's transcendental nature and purpose. Onewho is always able to understand the truth of Kåñëa consciousness, withoutopposition or confusion, is called kavi, or most learned.The position of those on the spiritual path can be understood in terms oftheir development of the qualities mentioned above. Ultimately, the mostimportant quality is to take shelter of Lord Kåñëa, since the Lord can award allgood qualities to His sincere devotee. In the lowest stage of devotional serviceone acts with a desire to enjoy sense gratification but at the same time tries tooffer the fruits to the Lord. This stage is called karma-miçrä bhakti. As onegradually purifies himself in devotional service, he becomes detached throughknowledge and gains relief from anxiety. In this stage he becomes attached totranscendental knowledge, and therefore this stage is called jïäna-miçräbhakti, or devotional service to Lord Kåñëa with a desire to enjoy the fruits oftranscendental knowledge. But because pure love for Kåñëa is actually thegreatest happiness and the natural position of the living entity, a sinceredevotee gradually overcomes his desire to enjoy sense gratification andknowledge and comes to the stage of pure devotional service, which is devoidof personal desire. Na karmäëi tyajed yogé karmabhis tyajyate hi saù: "The yogéshould not give up his work, but rather should cultivate detachment by whichhis material activities will automatically vanish." In other words, one shouldcontinue to perform one's prescribed duties, even imperfectly. If one is sincereabout advancing in Kåñëa consciousness, then by the strength of bhakti-yogahis activities will gradually be transformed into pure loving service.There are innumerable examples of fruitive workers, mental speculatorsand materialistic devotees who became perfect by the strength of devotionalservice. By rendering loving service to Kåñëa, one automatically experiencesthe greatest pleasure of life and is endowed with perfect knowledge. There isnothing lacking in the process of pure devotional service, and there is no needfor any extraneous endeavor to acquire sense pleasure or philosophicalsatisfaction. One must be completely convinced that simply by serving Kåñëaone will get all perfection in life. Even if one lacks some or all of theabove-mentioned qualities, one should sincerely engage in Lord Kåñëa'sservice, and gradually one's character will become perfect. One who is asincere devotee of Lord Kåñëa will develop all godly qualities by the mercy ofthe Lord, and one who is already serving the Lord with the above-mentionedqualities is to be understood as the greatest devotee. As indicated in verse 32, apure devotee of the Lord is fully aware of the pious advantages of executingduties within the varëäçrama system, and he is similarly aware of the harmfulmistake of neglecting such duties. Still, having full faith in the SupremePersonality of Godhead, a devotee gives up all ordinary social and religiousactivities and engages fully in devotional service. He knows that Lord Kåñëa isthe ultimate source of everything and that all perfection comes from LordKåñëa alone. Because of his extraordinary faith, the devotee is called sattama, or the best among all living beings.</div>
<div class="First">As explained by Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé in Upadeçämåta, a devotee who hasnot yet developed the good qualities mentioned above but is neverthelesssincerely endeavoring for Kåñëa consciousness should receive the mercy ofsuperior Vaiñëavas. One should not necessarily accept intimate associationwith such an aspirant to pure devotional service, but one should be confidentthat by chanting the holy names of Kåñëa such a person will eventually attainall perfection. One can imagine the beauty of a society filled with saintlypersons, as described in these verses. The wonderful Kåñëa conscious qualitiesmentioned above are the basis of a peaceful and prosperous society, and ifeveryone takes to the loving service of Lord Kåñëa, then certainly the presentatmosphere of fear, violence, lust, greed and insanity can be replaced by acelestial situation in which all leaders and citizens will be happy. The essentialpoints here are mat-çaraëa ("one should take full shelter of Lord Kåñëa") andmäà bhajeta ("one should worship the Lord through the authorized process").In this way the entire world can become sattama, or most perfect.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, although yävänindicates that Lord Kåñëa cannot be limited by time or space, He becomeslimited by the love of His pure devotees. For example, Lord Kåñëa never stepsone foot out of Våndävana, because of the intense love of its inhabitants forHim. In this way, the Lord comes under the control of His devotees' love. Theword yaù indicates that Kåñëa is the Absolute Truth who appears as the son ofVasudeva, or as Çyämasundara. Yädåça indicates that the Lord is ätmäräma, orcompletely self-satisfied, and also äpta-käma, or "one who automatically fulfillsall of His desires." Still, being affected by the love of His devotees, the Lordsometimes appears to be anätmäräma, or dependent on the love of Hisdevotees, and anäptakäma, unable to achieve His desire without thecooperation of His devotees. Actually, the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, is alwaysindependent, but He reciprocates the intense love of His devotees and thusappears to be dependent on them, just as He apparently became dependent onNanda Mahäräja and Yaçodä during His childhood pastimes in Våndävana.The word ajïätvä ("inexperienced, lacking knowledge") indicates thatsometimes a devotee may not have a proper philosophical understanding of thePersonality of Godhead or due to love may temporarily forget the Lord's</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">position. In Bhagavad-gétä (11.41) Arjuna says,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sakheti matvä prasabhaà yad uktaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">he kåñëa he yädava he sakheti</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ajänatä mahimänaà tavedaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mayä pramädät praëayena väpi</div>
<div class="First">"I have in the past addressed You as 'O Kåñëa,' 'O Yädava,' 'O my friend,'without knowing Your glories. Please forgive whatever I may have done inmadness or in love." Arjuna's words ajänatä mahimänam have the samemeaning as Kåñëa's words ajïätvä mäm in this verse of the Bhägavatam. Bothindicate incomplete understanding of Kåñëa's glories. In Bhagavad-gétä Arjunasays, praëayena: his forgetfulness of Kåñëa's supreme position was caused by hislove for Him. In this verse, Kåñëa excuses such lapses on the part of Hisdevotees with the words ajïätvä mäm, which indicate that even thoughdevotees may not fully appreciate His exalted position, Kåñëa accepts theirloving service. Thus this verse clearly reveals the supreme position of bhakti. Lord Kåñëa also states in Bhagavad-gétä (11.54):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhaktyä tv ananyayä çakya</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">aham evaà-vidho 'rjuna</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">jïätum drañöuà ca tattvena</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">praveñöuà ca parantapa</div>
<div class="First">"My dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as Iam, standing before you, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of My understanding."</div>
<div class="First">Although one may develop innumerable saintly qualities, without love ofKåñëa one will not achieve complete success. One must understand thePersonality of Godhead as He is and love Him. Even if one is not capable ofanalytically understanding the position of God, if one simply loves Kåñëa, thenone is certainly perfect. Many of the residents of Våndävana had no idea thatKåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, nor did they know of Kåñëa'spotencies or incarnations. They simply loved Kåñëa with their hearts andsouls, and therefore they are considered most perfect.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> My dear Uddhava, one can give up false pride and prestige by engaging in the following devotional activities. One may purify oneself by seeing, touching, worshiping, serving, and offering prayers of glorification and obeisances to My form as the Deity and to My pure devotees. One should also glorify My transcendental qualities and activities, hear with love and faith the narrations of My glories and constantly meditate on Me. One should offer to Me whatever one acquires, and accepting oneself as My eternal servant, one should give oneself completely to Me. One should always discuss My birth and activities and enjoy life by participating in festivals, such as Janmäñöamé, which glorify My pastimes. In My temple, one should also participate in festivals and ceremonies by singing, dancing, playing musical instruments and discussing Me with other Vaiñëavas. One should observe all the regularly celebrated annual festivals by attending ceremonies, pilgrimages and making offerings. One should also observe religious vows such as Ekädaçé and take initiation by the procedures mentioned in the Vedas, Païcarätra and other, similar literatures. One should faithfully and lovingly support the installation of My Deity, and individually or in cooperation with others one should work for the construction of Kåñëa conscious temples and cities as well as flower gardens, fruit gardens and special areas to celebrate My pastimes. One should consider oneself to be My humble servant, without duplicity, and thus should help to clean the temple, which is My home. First one should sweep and dust thoroughly, and then one should further cleanse with water and cow dung. Having dried the temple, one should sprinkle scented water and decorate the temple with mandalas. One should thus act just like My servant. A devotee should never advertise his devotional activities; therefore his service will not be the cause of false pride. One should never use lamps that are offered to Me for other purposes simply because there is need of illumination, and similarly, one should never offer to Me anything that has been offered to or used by others. Whatever is most desired by one within this material world, and whatever is most dear to oneself—one should offer that very thing to Me. Such an offering qualifies one for eternal life.</div>

<div class="First">In these eight verses Lord Kåñëa ends His discussion of saintly qualities ingeneral and describes the specific characteristics of the devotees of the Lord.Lord Kåñëa has clearly described both here and in Bhagavad-gétä that theultimate goal of life is to surrender fully to Him and become His pure devotee.Herein the Lord elaborately describes the process of devotional service. Oneshould offer everything that one acquires to the Lord, thinking, "Lord Kåñëahas sent these things so that I may serve Him nicely." One ultimately shouldunderstand that the minute spirit soul is part and parcel of Lord Kåñëa, andthus one should surrender one's very self to the Lord. Just as an ordinaryservant is meek and submissive to his master, similarly, a devotee should alwaysbe submissive to his spiritual master, who is a representative of Lord Kåñëa. Heshould realize how his body and mind are purified simply by his seeing thespiritual master or by accepting on his head the water offered to the spiritualmaster. It is emphasized in these verses that one should attend Vaiñëavafestivals. As far as possible, large festivals should be held all over the world sothat people can gradually learn how to perfect human life. The wordsmamärcä-sthäpane çraddhä are significant. Here Lord Kåñëa states that oneshould have faith in His Deity worship, since the Lord is personally present asthe Deity. The words udyänopavanäkréòa-pura-mandira-karmaëi indicate thatthere should be a serious endeavor to construct beautiful temples and Vaiñëavacities with ample parks, orchards and flower gardens. An outstanding exampleof such endeavors can be presently seen in India at the Mäyäpur Candrodaya Mandira.</div>
<div class="First">The words dépävalokaà me nopayuïjyän niveditam indicate that one maynever use the Deity's paraphernalia for sense gratification. If there is ashortage of electricity or lights, one may not use the Deity's lamps, nor shouldone ever offer to Lord Kåñëa paraphernalia previously offered to or used byothers. In these verses, the importance of Deity worship and Vaiñëava festivalsis emphasized in many ways. Lord Kåñëa promises that whoever sincerelyperforms these activities will certainly go back home, back to Godhead (tadänantyäya kalpate). One should offer his most dear possession to Lord Kåñëa,not that which is superfluous or unwanted. If one is most attached to hisfamily, one should see that his family is engaged in Lord Kåñëa's service. If oneis most attached to money, that should be given for propagating Kåñëaconsciousness. And if one considers one's intelligence to be most valuable, heshould preach Kåñëa consciousness with great logic and reason. If we offer ourmost valuable possessions to Lord Kåñëa, we will automatically become dear to the Lord and go back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="First">Unless one understands that Lord Kåñëa is all-pervading and thateverything is resting within the Lord, one's Kåñëa consciousness is third classand materialistic. It is clearly stated in all Vedic literatures that the SupremeAbsolute Truth is the source of everything. Everything is within Him, and Heis within everything. To avoid a materialistic conception of Lord Kåñëa, oneshould not think that the Lord exists only in a particular time and place.Rather, one should understand that He exists at all times and in all places andthat one may search for and find Lord Kåñëa within all things. The wordpüjä-padäni indicates that Lord Kåñëa is all-pervading, but this does not meanthat all things are Lord Kåñëa. Lord Kåñëa speaks this verse to clarify Hissupremacy as the all-pervading Personality of Godhead and to show the path of complete self-realization.</div>

I can be worshiped within the cows by offerings of grass and other suitable grains and paraphernalia for the pleasure and health of the cows, and one may worship Me within the Vaiñëavas by offering loving friendship to them and honoring them in all respects. Through steady meditation I am worshiped within the inner space of the heart, and within the air I can be worshiped by knowledge that präëa, the life air, is the chief among elements. I am worshiped within water by offerings of water itself, along with other elements such as flowers and tulasé leaves, and one may worship Me within the earth by proper application of confidential seed mantras.

Thus, one will naturally try to engage all material andspiritual elements in the loving service of Lord Kåñëa. If because of ignoranceone forgets the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one may become inclined toworship powerful material phenomena independent of the Supreme Lord, orone may foolishly consider oneself to be supreme.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Lord has previously explained that He appears in differenttranscendental forms to His pure devotees so that they may unlimitedlyincrease their love of Godhead. Here is given a general description of thefour-armed Näräyaëa form, which pervades the material world as Supersoul, orParamätmä. The pure devotees, however, do not meditate upon the Lordwithin the heart but rather render active service to a specific form of the Lord,such as Räma or Kåñëa, and thus perfect their realization of Bhagavän, or theSupreme Lord, who engages in transcendental pastimes with His devotees inthe spiritual world. Yet even within the material world one can spiritualizeone's existence by seeing the Supreme Lord within everything and worshipingHim by constant meditation. As mentioned in the previous verses, one shouldalso go to the temple and specifically worship the Deity and participate inspiritual festivals. One should not be puffed up and claim that because one ismeditating on the Lord within nature there is no need to go to the temple.Temple worship has been repeatedly emphasized by the Lord Himself. Theword samähita in this verse indicates samädhi. If one very carefully worshipsthe Deity or hears and chants about the pastimes of Lord Kåñëa, one iscertainly in samädhi. By worshiping and glorifying the Lord twenty-four hoursa day one becomes a liberated soul and gradually rises completely beyond theinfluence of the material creation. The living entity is called ätmä, or eternalsoul, because of his relationship with the Paramätmä, the Supreme Personalityof Godhead. By worshiping the Lord, our eternal nature revives, and as weincrease our enthusiasm and steadiness in devotional service, material existence fades away.</div>

<div class="First">The word iñöä-pürtena, which means "sacrificial performances and piousworks," does not indicate deviation from the pure devotional service of theLord. Lord Kåñëa, or Viñëu, is called Yajïa, or the Lord of sacrifice, and inBhagavad-gétä (5.29) Lord Kåñëa says, bhoktäraà yajïa-tapasäm: "I am theactual enjoyer of all sacrifice." The highest sacrifice is to chant the holy namesof the Lord, and by taking shelter of the Lord's names, one will acquireunflinching devotion and realized knowledge of the Absolute Truth. Arealized devotee is very attentive in his devotional service, taking it as his lifeand soul. He keeps himself fit for devotional service by constantly worshipingand glorifying the lotus feet of the spiritual master and the SupremePersonality of Godhead. Such hari-näma-kértana and guru-püjä are the onlypractical methods by which one can achieve pure devotional service. Whenhari-kértana is expanded, it is called kåñëa-saìkértana. One should not dry upby performing unauthorized austerities or sacrifices; rather, one should engagewith all enthusiasm in the great sacrifice of çré-kåñëa-saìkértana, which enablesone to easily achieve the highest perfection of human life.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa has described to Uddhava the characteristics of jïäna-yoga andbhakti-yoga, both of which are considered to be spiritual processes. Now,however, Lord Kåñëa clearly indicates that bhakti-yoga is the only real meansto totally free oneself from material existence, and that bhakti-yoga is notpossible without sat-saìga, or association with other Vaiñëavas. On the path ofbhakti-miçra jïäna, or speculation on the Absolute Truth mixed with devotion,one is still affected by the three modes of material nature. The pure soul,liberated from all material qualities, has no tendency or desire to engage inphilosophical speculation, severe austerities or impersonal meditation. Thepure soul simply loves Kåñëa and wants to serve Him constantly. Jévera'svarüpa' haya-kåñëera 'nitya-däsa.' [Cc. Madhya 20.108]. Pure devotionalservice to the Lord is called kevala-bhakti, whereas devotional service mixedwith speculative propensities is called guëa-bhüta-bhakti, or devotional servicepolluted by the material modes of nature. One who is actually intelligent doesnot make a show of philosophical wizardry but rather discerns the superiorityof pure love of Godhead and takes to the path of kevala-bhakti. One whoemphasizes so-called intellectual achievements is actually less intelligent,because such a person is more attracted to intelligence than to the pure soul,which is superior. It should be understood, however, that pure devotionalservice is not nonphilosophical or anti-intellectual. The Absolute Truth is farmore extensive than partial truth. Therefore, one who is in full knowledge ofLord Kåñëa has the greatest facility to engage in philosophical analysis, since apure devotee is working with the entire range of conceptual categories. Thosewho do not know Lord Kåñëa are attracted to the impersonal Brahman or thelocalized Paramätmä, but they are not aware of the ultimate category ofunderstanding called Bhagavän, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Lacking knowledge of Bhagavän, such imperfect philosophers certainly do notunderstand the expansion, interaction and withdrawal of the Lord'sinnumerable potencies and thus cannot fully analyze them. By faithfullyaccepting everything Lord Kåñëa speaks as the absolute truth, one comes to themature platform of philosophy and achieves perfect knowledge.In addition to philosophical or intellectual understanding, pure devotionalservice also awards all other benefits in life, both material and spiritual;therefore one who for any purpose whatsoever accepts a process other thandevotional service has unfortunately misunderstood the nature of puredevotional service to Lord Kåñëa. It is emphasized here that one must cultivatedevotional service in the association of other devotees. On the other hand, thejïäna-yoga process is cultivated alone, because it is difficult for even twomental speculators to be in the same place without their associationdegenerating into constant quarrel. Other processes of self-realization arecompared to the nipples on a goat's neck. They look just like breast nipples, butthey will not give any milk whatsoever. In this regard Çréla ViçvanäthaCakravarté Öhäkura has quoted the following verses, spoken by Çré Uddhava, Çukadeva Gosvämé and Närada Muni respectively.</div>

<div class="First">It is stated in the First Chapter of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.1.8), brüyuùsnigdhasya çiñyasya guravo guhyam apy uta: a bona fide spiritual masternaturally reveals all transcendental secrets to a sincere disciple. Çré Uddhavahad completely surrendered to Lord Kåñëa, and then only could the Lordexplain such mysteries to him, because without complete faith thetransmission of spiritual knowledge is impossible. Other processes of selfrealization, such as philosophical speculation, are imperfect and unsteadybecause the performer has personal desires, and there is no definite procedureby which to obtain the full mercy of the Supreme Lord. On the other hand,association with the pure devotees of the Lord is a self-sufficient process that isguaranteed to award the desired result. One must only learn how to associatewith the pure devotees and one's life will be perfect. That is the sum and substance of this chapter.</div>
<div class="First">Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Eleventh Chapter, ofthe Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Symptoms of Conditioned and Liberated Living Entities."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">12. Beyond Renunciation and Knowledge</div>
<div class="First">In this chapter the glories of holy association and the superexcellence of thepure love of the residents of Våndävana are described.The association of saintly devotees destroys the soul's attachment tomaterial life and is capable of bringing even the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, underone's control. Neither yoga, Säìkhya philosophy, ordinary religious duties,study of scriptures, austerities, renunciation, works of iñöä and pürtam, charity,vows of fasting, worship of the Deity, secret mantras, visiting of holy places,nor adherence to any major or minor regulative principles can effect the sameresult. In every age there are demons, monsters, birds and animals who are inthe modes of passion and ignorance, and there are also human beings in thecategories of businessmen, women, workers, outcastes, and so on, who cannotstudy the Vedic scriptures. Nevertheless, by the purifying effect of theassociation of devotees they may all achieve the supreme abode of thePersonality of Godhead, whereas without such saintly association, even thosevery seriously endeavoring in yoga, Säìkhya study, charity, vows and practiceof the renounced order of life may remain incapable of attaining the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="First">The young damsels of Vraja, ignorant of the true identity of LordKåñëacandra, considered Him to be their paramour who would give thempleasure. Yet by the power of their constant association with Çré Kåñëa, theyattained to the supreme Absolute Truth, which even great demigods likeBrahmä cannot achieve. The young women of Våndävana displayed such deepattachment to Lord Kåñëa that their minds, which were overflowing with theecstasy of being with Him, perceived an entire night spent in His company asjust a fraction of a second. However, when Akrüra took Çré Kåñëa along withBaladeva to Mathurä, the gopés then thought each night without Him to beequal in duration to a millennium of the demigods. Being tormented byseparation from Lord Kåñëa, they could not imagine anything that could givethem satisfaction other than His return. This is the incomparable excellence of the gopés' pure love of God.</div>
<div class="First">The Supreme Lord, Çré Kåñëa, after imparting these instructions toUddhava, advised that for the sake of attaining the Absolute Truth, Uddhavashould give up all consideration of religion and irreligion as promulgated inthe çrutis and småtis and instead take shelter of the example of the women of Våndävana.</div>

Association withpure devotees is sufficient for self-realization because one can learn everythingabout spiritual advancement from such devotees. With perfect knowledge onecan achieve all that one desires, for the process of devotional serviceimmediately brings the blessings of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Puredevotional service is transcendental to the modes of nature, and therefore itappears mysterious to the souls conditioned by those modes.In the previous chapter Lord Kåñëa stated, haviñägnau yajeta mäm: "Onemay worship Me in fire by offering oblations of ghee." (SB 11.11.43) Also, inverse 38 of the previous chapter it was mentioned that one should constructparks, recreational places, orchards, vegetable gardens, and so on. These serveto attract people to the temples of Kåñëa, where they may directly engage inchanting the holy name of the Lord. Such construction projects may beunderstood as pürtam, or public welfare activities. Although Lord Kåñëamentions in these two verses that association with His pure devotees is farmore powerful than processes such as yoga, philosophical speculation, sacrificesand public welfare activities, these secondary activities also please Lord Kåñëa,but to a lesser extent. Specifically, they please the Lord when performed bydevotees rather than by ordinary materialistic persons. Therefore thecomparative term yathä ("according to proportion") is used. In other words,such practices as sacrifice, austerity and philosophical study may help onebecome fit for rendering devotional service, and when such activities areperformed by devotees aspiring for spiritual advancement, they become somewhat pleasing to the Lord.</div>
<div class="First">One may study the example of vratäni, or vows. The injunction that oneshould fast on Ekädaçé is a permanent vow for all Vaiñëavas, and one shouldnot conclude from these verses that one may neglect the Ekädaçé vow. Thesuperiority of sat-saìga, or association with pure devotees, in awarding thefruit of love of Godhead does not mean that one should give up other processesor that these secondary processes are not permanent factors in bhakti-yoga.There are many Vedic injunctions instructing one to execute the agnihotrasacrifice, and the modern-day followers of Caitanya Mahäprabhu alsooccasionally execute fire sacrifices. Such sacrifice is recommended by the LordHimself in the previous chapter, and therefore it should not be given up by thedevotees of the Lord. By performing Vedic ritualistic and purificatoryprocesses, one is gradually elevated to the platform of devotional service,whereupon one is able to directly worship the Absolute Truth. One Vedicinjunction states, "The result awarded for fasting continuously for one monthon six different occasions can easily be achieved simply by accepting a handfulof rice offered to Lord Viñëu. This facility is especially offered in theKali-yuga." Nevertheless, regulated fasting on Ekädaçé is not an impediment tospiritual advancement. Rather, it is a perpetual aspect of devotional serviceand can be considered an auxiliary principle supporting the main principle ofworshiping Lord Kåñëa and His devotees. Because such secondary principleshelp one become fit for executing the primary processes of devotional service,they are also greatly beneficial. Therefore, such secondary principles arewidely mentioned throughout Vedic literature. It may be concluded that suchsecondary principles are essential for advancement in Kåñëa consciousness,and therefore one should never give up the principle of vrata, the execution of prescribed vows.</div>
<div class="First">In the previous chapter Çréla Çrédhara Svämé mentioned that the wordsäjïäyaivaà guëän doñän (SB 11.11.32) indicate that a devotee should selectVedic principles that do not conflict with his service to the Lord. Many of theelaborate Vedic ceremonies and complicated procedures for fasting, demigodworship and yoga practice cause great disturbance to the supreme process ofçravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù [SB 7.5.23], hearing and chanting about the Lord;therefore they are rejected by the Vaiñëavas. However, the processes helpful todevotional service should be accepted. The example can be given of MahäräjaYudhiñöhira, who was instructed by the dying Bhéñmadeva. InÇrémad-Bhägavatam (1.9.27) Bhéñma instructs King Yudhiñöhira indäna-dharma, or public acts of charity, räja-dharma, or the duties of a king,mokña-dharma, or duties for salvation, stré-dharma, or duties for women, andultimately bhägavata-dharma, or pure devotional service to the Lord. Bhéñmadid not limit his discussion to bhägavata-dharma, because Lord Kåñëa gaveMahäräja Yudhiñöhira the devotional service of acting as a king, and toexecute his service Yudhiñöhira Mahäräja required extensive knowledge ofcivic affairs. However, one who is not rendering such prescribed devotionalservice in society should not unnecessarily involve himself in the materialworld, even by practice of Vedic rituals. Nothing should distract him from the ultimate goal of satisfying Lord Kåñëa.</div>
<div class="First">The principle of not giving up prescribed vows may be further illustrated bythe example of Mahäräja Ambaréña. In the Ninth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatamwe find that although Mahäräja Ambaréña performed elaborate Vedicsacrifices, his goal was always the satisfaction of the Lord. The citizens in hiskingdom did not desire to go to heaven, because they were always hearingabout the glories of Vaikuëöha. Ambaréña Mahäräja, along with his queen,observed the vow of Ekädaçé and Dvädaçé for one year. Since AmbaréñaMahäräja is considered to be a great jewel among Vaiñëavas, and since hisbehavior was always exemplary, it is definitely concluded that such vows asfasting on Ekädaçé are imperative for Vaiñëavas. It is further stated in Vedicliterature, "If due to negligence a Vaiñëava does not fast on Ekädaçé, then hisworship of Lord Viñëu is useless, and he will go to hell." The members of theInternational Society for Krishna Consciousness fast from grains and beans onEkädaçé, and this vow should always be observed by all of its members.If one falsely thinks that one may obtain the association of Lord Kåñëamerely by great austerities, brilliant studies in Sanskrit literature,magnanimous acts of charity, etc., one's Kåñëa consciousness will be distortedand weakened. One should remember the example of Lord Caitanya, whopracticed Kåñëa consciousness by constantly hearing and chanting about LordKåñëa. If by fasting, study, austerity or sacrifice one becomes more fit toparticipate in the saìkértana movement of Lord Caitanya, then such activitiesare also pleasing to Lord Kåñëa. But the Lord clearly explains here that suchactivities can never become central in the practice of bhakti-yoga. They mustremain in an auxiliary relationship to the supreme process of sat-saìga, orassociation with pure devotees who hear and chant the glories of the Lord.Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted from Vedic literature that if one offends theLord's devotees and does not learn to associate with them, Lord Viñëupersonally places barriers in the path of such a person so that he may not enter into the Lord's company.</div>

<div class="Translation"> In every yuga many living entities entangled in the modes of passion and ignorance gained the association of My devotees. Thus, such living entities as the Daityas, Räkñasas, birds, beasts, Gandharvas, Apsaräs, Nägas, Siddhas, Cäraëas, Guhyakas and Vidyädharas, as well as such lower-class human beings as the vaiçyas, çüdras, women and others, were able to achieve My supreme abode. Våträsura, Prahläda Mahäräja and others like them also achieved My abode by association with My devotees, as did personalities such as Våñaparvä, Bali Mahäräja, Bäëäsura, Maya, Vibhéñaëa, Sugréva, Hanumän, Jämbavän, Gajendra, Jaöäyu, Tulädhära, Dharma-vyädha, Kubjä, the gopés in Våndävana and the wives of the brähmaëas who were performing sacrifice.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Lord has mentioned devotees such as the gopés in Våndävana and alsodemons like Bäëäsura to illustrate how He comes under the control of thosewho surrender to Him. It is understood that devotees like the gopés and othersmentioned here obtained pure love of Kåñëa, whereas the demons generallyobtained only salvation. Many demons were purified by association withdevotees and came to accept devotional service to the Lord as the mostimportant among the various activities in their lives, but the exalted devoteeslike Prahläda and Bali Mahäräja know nothing except devotional service,which they accept as their very life. Still, the reformed demons are alsomentioned so that readers of Çrémad-Bhägavatam will understand theenormous benefits one may achieve by associating with devotees of the Lord.The demon Våträsura was the pious King Citraketu in his previous life,during which he associated with Çré Närada Muni, Çré Aìgirä Muni and LordSaìkarñaëa. Prahläda Mahäräja, being the son of Hiraëyakaçipu, is considereda Daitya, or demon. Yet while still in the womb of his mother, Kayädhü, heassociated with Närada Muni by sound vibration. The demon Våñaparvä wasabandoned by his mother at birth, but he was raised by a muni and became adevotee of Lord Viñëu. Bali Mahäräja associated with his grandfather Prahlädaand also with Lord Vämanadeva. Bali Mahäräja's son, Bäëäsura, was saved byassociation with his father and Lord Çiva. He also associated with Lord Kåñëapersonally when the Lord cut off all but two of his one thousand arms, whichhad been awarded as a benediction by Lord Çiva. Understanding the glories ofLord Kåñëa, Bäëäsura also became a great devotee. The demon Maya Dänavaconstructed an assembly house for the Päëòavas and also associated with LordKåñëa Himself, eventually achieving the shelter of the Lord. Vibhéñaëa was apious-natured demon, the brother of Rävaëa, and he associated with Hanumän and Rämacandra.</div>
<div class="First">Sugréva, Hanumän, Jämbavän and Gajendra are examples of animals whoachieved the mercy of the Lord. Jämbavän, or Åkñaräja, was a member of a raceof monkeys. He personally associated with Lord Kåñëa, fighting with Him overthe Syamantaka jewel. The elephant Gajendra in a previous life hadassociation with devotees, and at the end of his life as Gajendra he waspersonally saved by the Lord. Jaöäyu, the bird who at the cost of his own lifeassisted Lord Rämacandra, associated with Çré Garuòa and MahäräjaDaçaratha as well as other devotees in räma-lélä. He also personally met withSétä and Lord Räma. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the association that theGandharvas, Apsaräs, Nägas, Siddhas, Cäraëas, Guhyakas and Vidyädharashad with the devotees is not very prominent and does not need to bementioned. Vaëikpatha is a vaiçya, and his story is mentioned in theMahäbhärata in connection with the pride of Jäjali Muni.The importance of association with devotees is illustrated in the story ofDharma-vyädha, the nonviolent hunter, as described in the Varäha Puräëa. Ina previous life he somehow became a brahma-räkñasa, or brähmaëa ghost, butwas eventually saved. In a previous Kali-yuga he had the association of aVaiñëava king named Väsu. The lady Kubjä associated directly with LordKåñëa, and in her previous birth she had associated with Çré Närada Muni Thegopés of Våndävana rendered service to saintly persons in their previous births.Having had ample association with devotees, they became gopés in Våndävanain their next lives and associated with the eternally liberated gopés who haddescended there. They also had association with Tulasé-devé, or Våndä-devé.The wives of the brähmaëas performing sacrifice had association with womensent by Lord Kåñëa to sell flower garlands and betel nuts and heard about the Lord from them.</div>

<div class="First">Study of the Vedic literature, worship of those who teach the çruti-mantras,acceptance of vows and austerities, etc., as mentioned previously, are helpfulprocesses that please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this verse,however, the Lord again explains that all such processes are secondary to theessential process of associating with the Supreme Personality of Godhead andHis pure devotees. By other processes one may gain the association of the Lordand His devotees, which will actually give the perfection of life. The wordmat-saìgät can also be read as sat-saìgät, with the same meaning. In thereading mat-saìgät ("from association with Me"), mat is also understood toindicate "those who are Mine," or the devotees. Çréla Çrédhara Svämé mentionsthat a pure devotee can advance in Kåñëa consciousness by his ownassociation, since simply by associating with his own activities and consciousness, he associates with the Lord.</div>

<div class="First">Although innumerable living entities achieved liberation by associationwith the Lord and His devotees, many such personalities also executed otherprocesses such as austerity, charity, philosophical speculation, and so on. As wehave already explained, such procedures are secondary. But the inhabitants ofVåndävana such as the gopés did not know anything except Lord Kåñëa, andtheir whole purpose in life was simply to love Lord Kåñëa, as indicated here bythe words kevalena hi bhävena. Even the trees, bushes and hills such asGovardhana loved Lord Kåñëa. As the Lord explains to His brother, ÇréBaladeva, in the Tenth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (10.15.5):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">aho amé deva-varämarärcitaà</div>

<div class="First">"My dear brother Baladeva, just see how these trees are bowing down withtheir branches and offering obeisances to Your lotus feet, which areworshipable even by the demigods. Indeed, My dear brother, You are theSupreme God, and thus these trees have produced fruits and flowers as anoffering to You. Although a living entity takes birth as a tree due to the modeof ignorance, certainly by such a birth in Våndävana these trees are destroyingall darkness in their lives by serving Your lotus feet."Although many living entities achieved the mercy of Lord Kåñëa byassociating with the Lord and His devotees in various ways, those who takeLord Kåñëa as everything are situated in the highest process of spiritualrealization. Therefore the Lord has not bothered to mention in this verse thosewho achieved perfection through mixed processes, but rather glorifies theunalloyed devotees of Våndävana, headed by the gopés, who knew nothing butLord Kåñëa. The residents of Våndävana were so satisfied in their relationshipswith Lord Kåñëa that they did not pollute their loving service with mentalspeculation or fruitive desires. The gopés served Lord Kåñëa in the conjugalrasa, or relationship, whereas according to Çréla Viçvanätha CakravartéÖhäkura the cows loved Lord Kåñëa in vätsalya-rasa, or the love of parents fora child, because the cows were always supplying milk to child Kåñëa.Unmoving objects like Govardhana Hill and other hills and mountains lovedLord Kåñëa as a friend, and the ordinary animals, trees and bushes ofVåndävana loved Lord Kåñëa in däsya-rasa, or with love of a servant for hismaster. Snakes like Käliya also developed this love in servitude, and afterrelishing their loving service to Lord Kåñëa, all of them went back home, backto Godhead. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, all thoseinhabitants of Våndävana should be considered eternally liberated souls, asexpressed by the word siddhäù, which means "having achieved the perfection of life."</div>

Anyone who isfavorably living with the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes sat, oreternal, and thus the association of such a person can immediately awardothers pure devotional service to the Lord. There is an austerity calledcändräyaëa, a fast in which one's intake of food is diminished by one mouthfuleach day as the moon wanes and increased in the same way as the moon waxes.Similarly, there are painstaking ritualistic sacrifices and grueling studies of theSanskrit Vedic mantras, which one may also teach to others.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Çrédhara Svämé comments as follows. "The gopés suffered extremeanxiety in the absence of Lord Kåñëa, and though outwardly appearingbewildered, they actually achieved the highest perfectional stage of samädhi.Their consciousness was intensely and intimately attached to Lord Kåñëa, andby such Kåñëa consciousness their own bodies seemed very far away from them,even though people normally consider their body to be their closest possession.In fact, the gopés did not think about their own existence. Although a youngwoman normally considers her husband and children to be her dearmostpossessions, the gopés did not even consider the existence of their so-calledfamilies. Nor could they think of this world or life after death. Indeed, theywere not at all aware of these things. Just like great sages who become detachedfrom the names and forms of the material world, the gopés could not think ofanything, because they were rapt in loving remembrance of Lord Kåñëa. Just asrivers enter the ocean, similarly, the gopés completely merged into consciousness of Lord Kåñëa through intense love."</div>
<div class="First">Thus a day of Brahmä seemed like a single moment for the gopés when LordKåñëa was present with them, and a single moment seemed like a day ofBrahmä when Lord Kåñëa was absent.

<div class="Translation"> My dear Uddhava, just as great sages in yoga trance merge into self-realization, like rivers merging into the ocean, and are thus not aware of material names and forms, similarly, the gopés of Våndävana were so completely attached to Me within their minds that they could not think of their own bodies, or of this world, or of their future lives. Their entire consciousness was simply bound up in Me.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The words svam ätmänam adas tathedam indicate that while for ordinarypersons one's personal body is the most near and dear thing, the gopésconsidered their own bodies to be distant and remote, just as a yogé in samädhitrance considers ordinary things around his physical body or his physical bodyitself to be most remote. When Kåñëa played on His flute late at night, thegopés immediately forgot everything about their so-called husbands andchildren and went to dance with Lord Kåñëa in the forest. These controversialpoints have been clearly explained in the book Kåñëa, by His Divine GraceA.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda. The basic explanation is that LordKåñëa is the source of everything, and the gopés are the Lord's own potency.Thus there is no discrepancy or immorality in the almighty Personality ofGodhead's loving affairs with His own manifest potency, the gopés, who happento be the most beautiful young girls in the creation of God.There is no illusion on the part of the gopés, for they are so attracted to LordKåñëa that they do not care to think of anything else. Since all existence issituated within the body of Lord Kåñëa, there is no loss for the gopés when theyconcentrate on the Lord. It is the nature of very deep love to exclude allobjects except the beloved. However, in the material world, where we try tolove a limited temporary object such as our nation, family or personal body,our exclusion of other objects constitutes ignorance. But when our love isintensely concentrated on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the origin ofeverything, such concentration cannot be considered ignorance or small-mindedness.</div>
<div class="First">The example of the sages in samädhi is given here only to illustrateexclusive concentration on a single object. Otherwise, there is no comparisonbetween the ecstatic love of the gopés and the dry meditation of the yogés, whomerely try to understand that they are not their material bodies. Since thegopés had no material bodies to become detached from and were personallydancing with and embracing the Absolute Truth, one can never compare theexalted position of the gopés to that of mere yogés. It is stated that the bliss ofimpersonal Brahman realization cannot be compared to even an atomicfragment of the blissful ocean of love of Kåñëa. Intimate attachment is like astrong rope that binds the mind and heart. In material life we are bound tothat which is temporary and illusory, and therefore such binding of the heartcauses great pain. However, if we bind our minds and hearts to the eternalLord Kåñëa, the reservoir of all pleasure and beauty, then our hearts willexpand unlimitedly in the ocean of transcendental bliss.One should understand that the gopés were not in any way inclined towardimpersonal meditation, in which one denies the reality of variegated creation.The gopés did not deny anything; they simply loved Kåñëa and could not thinkof anything else. They only rejected whatever impeded their concentration onLord Kåñëa, cursing even their own eyelids, which blinked and thus removedKåñëa from their sight for a split second. Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé has stated that allsincere devotees of the Lord should have the courage to remove from theirlives anything that impedes their progressive march back home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="First">The words asvarüpa-vidaù ("not understanding My actual position or form")indicate that the lovely gopés were so completely absorbed in conjugal love forLord Kåñëa that they were not aware of the Lord's unlimited potencies as theSupreme Personality of Godhead. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkuraexplains this and other meanings of the word asvarüpa-vidaù. In Sanskrit theword vid also means "to acquire." Thus, asvarüpa-vidaù indicates that the gopés,like other pure devotees of the Lord, were not interested in achievingsärüpya-mukti, the liberation of acquiring a bodily form similar to the Lord's.Were the gopés to obtain a bodily form like the Lord's, how could the Lordexecute His conjugal pastimes of dancing with the gopés and embracing them?Since the gopés had realized their eternal spiritual forms as servitors of theLord, the word svarüpa also may indicate their own spiritual bodies, and thusasvarüpa-vidaù means that the gopés never thought, as materialists do, of theirown bodily beauty. Although the gopés are the most beautiful girls in the Lord'screation, they never thought of their own bodies but rather were alwaysmeditating on the transcendental body of Lord Kåñëa. Although we cannotimitate the gopé's exalted conjugal feelings, we can follow their superb exampleof practical Kåñëa consciousness. They naturally took shelter of Lord Kåñëa and achieved the highest perfection of life.</div>

<div class="First">Çré Uddhava inquired from Lord Kåñëa about the symptoms of saintlypersons and liberated souls, and the Lord has replied in terms of differentlevels of spiritual advancement, distinguishing between those who are able tounderstand Lord Kåñëa to be the principal goal of life and those lovingdevotees who accept Lord Kåñëa and devotional service to Him as the onlygoal of life. Lord Kåñëa also mentioned that He is captured by His lovingdevotees and even by those who sincerely associate with His loving devotees.Among all the devotees, the gopés of Våndävana were described by the Lord ashaving achieved such a rare state of pure devotional service that Lord Kåñëapersonally feels constantly indebted to them. According to Çréla ViçvanäthaCakravarté Öhäkura, Lord Kåñëa previously kept the gopés' love for Himconcealed in His heart because of its confidential nature and the Lord's owngravity. Finally, however, even Lord Kåñëa could not remain silent about theintense love of the gopés, and thus in these verses the Lord reveals to Uddhavahow the gopés loved Him in Våndävana and brought Him fully under theircontrol. The Lord would relax in secret places with the loving gopés, and byconjugal spontaneous affection the greatest love was exchanged between them.As explained by the Lord in Bhagavad-gétä, one cannot achieve theperfection of life merely by renouncing the material world or by executingordinary, sectarian religious principles. One must actually understand theidentity of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and by associating with Hispure devotees one must learn to love the Lord in His personal, original form.This love may be expressed in either the conjugal, paternal, fraternal orserving rasa, or relationship. The Lord has elaborately explained to Uddhavathe system of philosophical analysis of the material world, and now He clearlyconcludes that it is useless for Uddhava to waste time in fruitive activities ormental speculation. Actually, Lord Kåñëa is hinting that Uddhava shouldassimilate the example of the gopés and try to advance further in Kåñëaconsciousness by following in the footsteps of the cowherd damsels of Vraja.Any conditioned soul who is unsatisfied with the cruel laws of nature, whichimpose disease, old age and death, should understand that Lord Kåñëa candeliver all living beings from the problems of material existence. There is noneed to entangle oneself in unauthorized, sectarian rituals, injunctions orprohibitions. One should simply surrender to Lord Kåñëa, following theexample of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, who is Lord Kåñëa Himself. By theauthorized regulated process of bhakti-yoga, Kåñëa consciousness, one easily achieves spiritual perfection.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the first verse of the Tenth Chapter of this canto, the Lord stated thatone should take shelter of Him and execute one's duties within the varëäçramasystem without material desire. Uddhava interpreted this statement asrecommending karma-miçrä bhakti, or devotional service mixed with atendency toward fruitive activities. It is a fact that until one understands LordKåñëa to be everything, it is not possible to retire from ordinary, worldlyduties. Rather, one is encouraged to offer the fruits of such work to the Lord.In verse 4 of the Tenth Chapter, the Lord recommended that one retire fromworldly duties and systematically cultivate knowledge, accepting Him as theSupreme. Uddhava understood this instruction to indicate jïäna-miçrä bhakti,or devotional service to the Lord mixed with the secondary desire toaccumulate knowledge. Beginning with verse 35 of the Tenth Chapter,Uddhava inquired about the process of material conditioning and liberationfrom material life. The Lord replied elaborately, stating that withoutdevotional service the process of philosophical speculation can never beperfected. In Chapter Eleven, verse 18, the Lord emphasized the importance offaith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and in verse 23 Kåñëaextensively widened His discussion of devotional service, emphasizing that oneshould be faithful and hear and chant the glories of the Lord. The Lordconcluded that both the development and perfection of devotional servicedepend on association with the devotees. In verse 26 of the Eleventh Chapter,Uddhava inquired about the actual ways and means of devotional service andabout the symptoms of devotional perfection. And in verse 48 Lord Kåñëastated that unless one takes to the process of devotional service, one's attemptfor liberation will be useless. One must associate with the devotees of the Lordand follow in their footsteps. Finally, in verse 14 of this chapter the Lordcategorically rejected the paths of fruitive activities and mental speculationand in verse 15 recommended that one exclusively surrender unto Him with all one's heart.</div>
<div class="First">Having received such elaborate and technical instructions on theperfection of life, Uddhava is bewildered, and his mind is afflicted with doubtabout what he should actually do. Lord Kåñëa has described many proceduresand the results of such procedures, all of which ultimately lead to the singlegoal of Lord Kåñëa Himself. Uddhava therefore desires that Lord Kåñëa statein simple terms what should be done. Arjuna makes a similar request of theLord at the beginning of the Third Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä. According toÇréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, Uddhava is stating here, "My dearfriend Kåñëa, first You recommended that I perform worldly activities withinthe varëäçrama system, and then You advised that I reject such activities andtake to the path of philosophical research. Now rejecting the path of jïäna,You recommend that I simply surrender unto You in bhakti-yoga. If I acceptYour decision, in the future You may again go back to Your original point andrecommend worldly activities." By his boldness in disclosing his mind,Uddhava reveals his intimate friendship with Lord Kåñëa.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura comments as follows on the dialoguebetween Lord Kåñëa and Uddhava. Uddhava was bewildered and doubtfulbecause Lord Kåñëa explained many different processes such as devotionalservice, speculative knowledge, renunciation, mystic yoga, austerities, piousduties, and so on. However, all of these processes are meant to help the livingentities obtain the shelter of Lord Kåñëa, and ultimately no Vedic processshould be understood in any other way. Thus Lord Kåñëa explained the entireVedic system, placing everything in proper order. In fact, Lord Kåñëa wassurprised that Uddhava foolishly thought that he was meant to practice everyprocess, as if each method were meant simply for him. Lord Kåñëa thereforewants to inform His devotee, "My dear Uddhava, when I told you that analyticknowledge is to be practiced, pious duties are to be performed, devotionalservice is obligatory, yoga procedures must be observed, austerities are to beexecuted, etc., I was instructing all living entities, using you as My immediateaudience. That which I have spoken, am speaking now and will speak in thefuture should be understood as guidance for all living entities in differentsituations. How could you possibly think that you were meant to practice all ofthe different Vedic processes? I accept you as you are now, My pure devotee.You are not supposed to execute all of these processes." Thus according to ÇrélaViçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the Lord, with lighthearted and encouragingwords, reveals to Uddhava the deep purpose behind the variety of Vedic procedures.</div>
<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa became manifest from the mouth of Lord Brahmä in the form ofthe Vedas. The word vivara-prasüti in this verse also indicates that the Lord ismanifest within the ädhärädi-cakras situated within the body of Lord Brahmä.The word ghoñeëa means "subtle sound," and guhäà praviñöaù also indicatesthat Lord Kåñëa enters within the ädhära-cakra. The Lord can further beperceived within other cakras such as the maëipüraka-cakra, located aroundthe navel, and the viçuddhi-cakra. The Sanskrit alphabet is composed of shortand long vowels, and consonants pronounced with high and low tones, andutilizing these vibrations the different branches of Vedic literatures aremanifested as a gross form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Accordingto Bhagavad-gétä, such literatures deal mostly with the three modes of materialnature: traiguëya-viñayä vedä nistrai-guëyo bhavärjuna. Çréla Çrédhara Sväméexplains that due to the control of the illusory energy, mäyä, the Personality ofGodhead appears to the conditioned souls as part of the material universe. Theimagined imposition of gross and subtle material qualities on the Personality ofGodhead is called avidyä, or ignorance, and through such ignorance the livingentity considers himself to be the doer of his own activities and becomesbound up in the network of karma. The Vedas therefore order an entangledsoul to observe positive and negative injunctions to purify his existence. Theseprocedures are called pravåtti-märga, or the path of regulated fruitive activities.When one has purified one's existence, one gives up this gross stage of fruitiveactivities because it is detrimental to the practice of pure devotional service.By firm faith one may then worship the Personality of Godhead. One who hasdeveloped perfect Kåñëa consciousness no longer has to perform ritualisticduties. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, tasya käryaà na vidyate.According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, this verse may be understood in anotherway. The word jéva indicates Lord Kåñëa, who gives life to the residents ofVåndävana, and vivara-prasüti indicates that although Lord Kåñëa eternallyperforms His pastimes in the spiritual world, beyond the vision of theconditioned souls, He also enters within the material universe to display thesesame pastimes. The words guhäà praviñöaù indicates that after displaying suchpastimes, the Lord withdraws them and enters into His unmanifest pastimes,or those pastimes not manifest to the conditioned souls. In this case, mäträindicates the transcendental senses of the Lord, svara indicates the Lord'stranscendental sound vibration and singing, and the word varëa indicates thetranscendental form of the Lord. The word sthaviñöha, or "gross manifestation,"means that the Lord becomes manifest in the material world even to thosedevotees who are not completely advanced in Kåñëa consciousness and whosevision is not completely purified. Mano-maya indicates that somehow or otherLord Kåñëa is to be kept within one's mind; and for the nondevotees LordKåñëa is sükñma, or most subtle, because He cannot be known. Thus differentäcäryas have glorified Lord Kåñëa in different ways through the transcendental sound vibration of this verse.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa here explains the most confidential meaning of Vedicknowledge. The Vedas first regulate ordinary material work and channel thefruits into ritualistic sacrifices, which ostensibly reward the performer withfuture benefits. The real purpose of these sacrifices, however, is to accustom amaterialistic worker to offering the fruits of his work to a superior Vedicauthority. An expert fruitive worker gradually exhausts the possibilities ofmaterial enjoyment and naturally gravitates toward the superior stage ofphilosophical speculation on his existential situation. By increased knowledge,one becomes aware of the unlimited glories of the Supreme and gradually takesto the process of loving devotional service to the transcendental AbsoluteTruth. Lord Kåñëa is the goal of Vedic knowledge, as the Lord states inBhagavad-gétä: vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù [Bg. 15.15]. The Lord graduallybecomes manifest in the progression of Vedic rituals, just as fire is graduallymanifest by the rubbing of firewood. The words haviñä samedhate ("the fireincreases by addition of ghee") indicate that by the progressive advancementof Vedic sacrifice, the fire of spiritual knowledge gradually blazes, illuminatingeverything and destroying the chain of fruitive work.Lord Kåñëa considered Uddhava to be the most qualified person to hear thiselaborate transcendental knowledge; therefore the Lord mercifully instructsUddhava so that he may enlighten the sages at Badarikäçrama, thus fulfilling the purpose of the sages' lives.</div>

A Kåñëa conscious person sees the entire material world as amanifestation of the Lord's potencies. There is therefore no legitimate scopefor material sense gratification, because everything is an expansion from theSupreme Personality of Godhead and belongs to Him. One who canunderstand the expansion of the Lord within subtle and gross materialmanifestations gives up his desire to live in this world. In the spiritual worldeverything is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge. The exclusive feature of thematerial world is that here the living entity dreams that he is lord.

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> When many seeds are placed in an agricultural field, innumerable manifestations of trees, bushes, vegetables and so on will arise from a single source, the soil. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who gives life to all and is eternal, originally exists beyond the scope of the cosmic manifestation. In the course of time, however, the Lord, who is the resting place of the three modes of nature and the source of the universal lotus flower, in which the cosmic manifestation takes place, divides His material potencies and thus appears to be manifest in innumerable forms, although He is one.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Véraräghaväcärya comments that one may question as to whom thecosmic manifestation, consisting of demigods, men, animals, plants, planets,space, etc., actually belongs. Lord Kåñëa now eradicates any doubt about thesource of the cosmic manifestation. The word tri-våt indicates that the threemodes of nature are not independent but are under superior control. Thesuffix våt means the vartanam, or "existence," of the three modes of materialnature within the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Analyzing the termabja-yoni, ap indicates "water," and ja indicates "birth." Thus abja means thecomplex material universe, which sprouts from Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, wholies in the Garbhodaka Ocean. Yoni, or "source," indicates the Personality ofGodhead, and thus abja-yoni means that the Lord is the source of all cosmicmanifestations; indeed, all creation takes place within the Lord. Since thethree modes of material nature are under the superior control of the Lord,material objects helplessly undergo creation and annihilation within theuniversal shell by the will of the Lord. The term avyakta indicates the Lord'ssubtle spiritual form, which exists alone before the material creation. TheLord's original form, being spiritual, does not undergo birth, transformation ordeath. It is eternal. In the course of time, the Lord's material potencies aredivided and manifest as bodies, bodily paraphernalia, sense objects, bodilyexpansions, false ego and false proprietorship. Thus the Lord expands Hisconscious living potency called jéva-çakti, which is manifest in innumerablematerial forms such as those of men, demigods, animals, and so on. From theexample of the seeds sown in an agricultural field, we can understand thatinnumerable manifestations may arise from a single source. Similarly, althoughthe Lord is one, He becomes manifest in innumerable forms through the expansion of His different potencies.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Just as woven cloth rests on the expansion of lengthwise and crosswise threads, similarly the entire universe is expanded on the lengthwise and crosswise potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is situated within Him. The conditioned soul has been accepting material bodies since time immemorial, and these bodies are like great trees sustaining one's material existence. Just as a tree first blossoms and then produces fruit, similarly the tree of material existence, one's material body, produces the various results of material existence.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Before a tree produces fruit, blossoms appear. Similarly, the wordpuñpa-phale, according to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, indicates thehappiness and distress of material existence. One's material life may appear tobe blossoming, but ultimately there will appear the bitter fruits of old age,death and other catastrophes. Attachment to the material body, which isalways inclined toward sense gratification, is the root cause of materialexistence, and it is therefore called saàsära-taru. The tendency to exploit theexternal energy of the Supreme Lord has existed since time immemorial, asexpressed by the words puräëaù karmätmakaù. The material universe is anexpansion of the illusory potency of the Supreme Lord and is alwaysdependent on Him and nondifferent from Him. This simple understandingcan relieve the conditioned souls from endless wandering in the unhappy kingdom of mäyä.</div>
<div class="First">The word puñpa-phale may also be understood as meaning sensegratification and liberation. The tree of material existence will be further explained in the following verses.</div>

Two birds, namely the individualsoul and the Supersoul, have made their nest in this tree, and the three typesof bark are air, bile and mucus, the constituent elements of the body.

<div class="First">Because Uddhava had achieved the perfection of personal association withLord Kåñëa, there was no need for him to maintain the mentality of aconditioned soul, and thus, as described here by the words sampadyacätmänam, Uddhava could personally serve the lotus feet of the Lord in thespiritual world. Indeed, Uddhava requested this opportunity at the beginningof this great conversation. As stated here, gurüpäsanayaika-bhaktyä: one canachieve pure devotional service by worshiping a bona fide spiritual master. It isnot recommended here that one give up pure devotional service or one'sspiritual master. Rather, it is clearly stated by the words vidyä-kuöhäreëa thatone should cultivate knowledge of the material world as described by LordKåñëa in this chapter. One should fully understand that each and every aspectof the material creation is the expansion of the illusory potency of the Lord.Such knowledge works as a sharpened ax to cut down the roots of materialexistence. In this way, even the stubborn subtle body, created by the threemodes of nature, is cut to pieces, and one becomes apramatta, or sane and cautious in Kåñëa consciousness.</div>
<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa has clearly explained in this chapter that the cowherd damselsof Våndävana were not interested in an analytical approach to life. Theysimply loved Lord Kåñëa and could not think of anything else. Lord CaitanyaMahäprabhu taught that all His devotees should follow in the footsteps of thecowherd damsels of Vraja in order to develop the highest intensity of selflesslove of Godhead. Lord Kåñëa has elaborately analyzed the nature of thematerial world so that the conditioned souls, who are trying to enjoy it, can cutdown the tree of material existence with this knowledge. The words sampadyacätmänam indicate that a person with such knowledge has no further materialexistence, because he has already achieved the Personality of Godhead. Such aperson should not loiter in the kingdom of mäyä, perpetually refining hisunderstanding of the illusory creation. One who has accepted Lord Kåñëa aseverything may enjoy eternal bliss in the Lord's service. Yet even though heremains in this world, he has no more business with it and gives up theanalytical procedures for negating it. Lord Kåñëa therefore tells Uddhava,tyajästram: "Give up the ax of analytic knowledge by which you have cut downyour sense of proprietorship and residence in the material world."Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Twelfth Chapter, of theÇrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Beyond Renunciation and Knowledge."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">13. The Haàsa-avatära Answers the Questions of the Sons of</div>
<div class="First"> Brahmä</div>
<div class="First">In this chapter, Lord Çré Kåñëa explains to Uddhava how human beings,overwhelmed by sense gratification, become bound by the three modes ofnature, and how to renounce these modes. The Lord then describes how Heappeared in His form of Haàsa before Brahmä and the four sages headed bySanaka and revealed to them various confidential truths.The three modes-goodness, passion and ignorance-are related to materialintelligence, not to the soul. One should conquer the lower modes of passionand ignorance by the mode of goodness, and then one must surpass the modeof goodness by acting in the transcendental mode of pure goodness. Byassociating with things in the mode of goodness, one becomes more fullysituated in that mode. The three modes increase their different influencesthrough various types of scripture, water, place, time, beneficiaries of activity,natures of activity, birth, meditation, mantras, purificatory rituals, and so on.Lacking discrimination, one identifies with the material body, andconsequently the mode of passion, which produces misery, takes over the mind,which is normally in the mode of goodness. As the mind evolves its function ofdecision and doubt, it creates intolerable hankerings for sense gratification.Unfortunate persons who are bewildered by the urges of the mode of passionbecome the slaves of their senses. Even though they know that the eventualresult of their work will be suffering, they cannot avoid engaging in suchfruitive work. A discriminating person, on the other hand, keeps himselfdetached from the objects of the senses and, by utilizing appropriaterenunciation, takes shelter of unalloyed devotional service.Lord Brahmä himself has no material cause. He is the cause of the creationof all living beings and is the greatest among all the demigods. Yet evenBrahmä is always suffering agitation of the mind on account of the duties hehas to perform; therefore, when he was questioned by his sons headed bySanaka, who were born from his mind, about the means for driving awaydesires for sense gratification, he was incapable of giving them an answer. Inorder to receive some insight into this matter, he took shelter of the SupremePersonality of Godhead, whereupon the Supreme Lord appeared before him inthe form of the swan incarnation, Lord Haàsa. Lord Haàsa proceeded to giveinstructions about the categorical identity of the self, the different states ofconsciousness (wakeful awareness, sleep and deep sleep) and the means forconquering over material existence. The sages headed by Sanaka became freedfrom all their doubts by hearing the words of the Lord and worshiped Him with pure devotion in mature love of God.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: The three modes of material nature, namely goodness, passion and ignorance, pertain to material intelligence and not to the spirit soul.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Goodness in the material world never exists in a pure form. Therefore, it iscommon knowledge that on the material platform no one is working withoutpersonal motivation. In the material world goodness is always mixed with someamount of passion and ignorance, whereas spiritual, or purified, goodness(viçuddha-sattva) represents the liberated platform of perfection. Materially,one is proud to be an honest, compassionate man, but unless one is fully Kåñëaconscious one will speak truths that are not ultimately significant, and one willgive mercy that is ultimately useless. Because the onward march of materialtime removes all situations and persons from the material stage, our so-calledmercy and truth apply to situations that shortly will not exist. Real truth iseternal, and real mercy means to situate people in eternal truth. Still, for anordinary person, cultivation of material goodness may be a preliminary stageon the road to Kåñëa consciousness. For example, it is stated in the TenthCanto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam that one who is addicted to meat-eating cannotunderstand the pastimes of Lord Kåñëa. By cultivation of the material mode ofgoodness, however, one may become a vegetarian and perhaps come toappreciate the sublime process of Kåñëa consciousness. Since it is clearly statedin Bhagavad-gétä that the material modes of nature constantly rotate, one musttake advantage of an elevated position in material goodness to step onto thetranscendental platform. Otherwise, as the wheel of time turns one will again go into the darkness of material ignorance.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Since the three modes of material nature are constantly in conflict, vyingfor supremacy, how is it possible that the mode of goodness can subdue themodes of passion and ignorance? Lord Kåñëa here explains how one can bestrongly fixed in the mode of goodness, which automatically gives rise toreligious principles. In the Fourteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä, Lord Kåñëaelaborately explains the things that are in goodness, passion and ignorance.Thus, by choosing food, attitudes, work, recreation, etc., strictly in the mode ofgoodness, one will become situated in that mode. The usefulness ofsattva-guëa, or the mode of goodness, is that it produces religious principlesaimed at and characterized by devotional service to Lord Kåñëa. Without suchdevotional service to the Lord, the mode of goodness is considered useless andmerely another aspect of material illusion. The word våddhät, or "strengthened,increased," indicates clearly that one should come to the platform ofviçuddha-sattva, or purified goodness. The word våddhät indicates growth, andgrowth should not be stopped until full maturity is reached. The full maturityof goodness is called véçuddha-sattva, or the transcendental platform on whichthere is no trace of any other quality. In pure goodness all knowledgeautomatically manifests, and one can easily understand one's eternal lovingrelationship with Lord Kåñëa. That is the actual meaning and purpose of dharma, or religious principles.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Madhväcärya points out in this regard that an increase in the mode ofgoodness strengthens religious principles and the invigorated execution ofreligious principles strengthens the mode of goodness. In that way, one canadvance higher and higher in the mode of spiritual happiness.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">One who desires to cultivate the mode of goodness must consider thefollowing points. One should study religious scriptures that teach detachmentfrom mental speculation and material sense gratification, not scriptures thatprovide rituals and mantras to increase material ignorance. Such materialisticscriptures do not give attention to the Supreme Personality of Godhead andthus are basically atheistic. One should accept pure water for quenching thirstand cleaning the body. There is no need for a devotee to use colognes,perfume, whiskey, beer, etc., which are all polluted manifestations of water.One should associate with persons who are cultivating detachment from thematerial world and not with those who are materially attached or sinful intheir behavior. One should live in a solitary place where devotional service ispracticed and discussed among Vaiñëavas. One should not be spontaneouslyattracted to busy highways, shopping centers, sports stadiums, and so on.Concerning time, one should rise by four o'clock in the morning and utilizethe auspicious brähma-muhürta to advance in Kåñëa consciousness. Similarly,one should avoid the sinful influence of hours such as midnight when ghostsand demons are encouraged to become active. Concerning work, one shouldexecute one's prescribed duties, follow the regulative principles of spiritual lifeand utilize all of one's energy for pious purposes. Time should not be wasted infrivolous or materialistic activities, of which there are now literally millions inmodern society. One can cultivate birth in the mode of goodness by acceptingthe second birth of initiation from a bona fide spiritual master and learning tochant the Hare Kåñëa mantra. One should not accept initiation or so-calledspiritual birth in unauthorized mystical or religious cults in the modes ofpassion and ignorance. One should meditate upon the Supreme Personality ofGodhead as the enjoyer of all sacrifices, and similarly, one should meditate onthe lives of great devotees and saintly persons. One should not meditate onlusty women and envious men. Concerning mantras, one should follow theexample of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu by chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra andnot other songs, verses, poetry or mantras that glorify the kingdom of illusion.Purificatory rituals should be performed to purify the spirit soul and not tobring down material blessings on one's material household.One who increases the mode of goodness will certainly become fixed inreligious principles, and automatically knowledge will arise. As knowledgeincreases one is able to understand the eternal spirit soul and the SupremeSoul, Lord Kåñëa. Thus the soul becomes free from the artificial imposition ofthe gross and subtle material bodies caused by the modes of material nature.Spiritual knowledge burns to ashes the material designations that cover the living entity, and one's real, eternal life begins.</div>

Çréla BhaktisiddhäntaSarasvaté Öhäkura has described the concept of vyatyaya by giving the Sanskritsynonym vaiñamya, which indicates inequality or disproportionate diversity.Thus, it is understood by the term guëa-vyatyaya-jaù that the body is generatedby the unstable relationships of the three modes of material nature, whichexist everywhere in constantly changing proportions. There is constant strifeamong the modes of nature. A good person is sometimes torn by passion, and apassionate person sometimes wants to give up everything and rest. Anignorant person may sometimes become disgusted with his depraved life, and apassionate person may sometimes indulge in bad habits in the mode ofignorance. Due to the interactive conflict of the modes of nature, one wandersthroughout material nature creating one body after another by one's ownwork, karma. As it is said, variety is the mother of enjoyment, and the varietyof material modes gives hope to the conditioned souls that by changing theirmaterial situation their unhappiness and frustration can be turned intohappiness and satisfaction. But even if one acquires relative materialhappiness, that will soon be disturbed by the inevitable flux of the material modes.</div>

One engaged in material life suffers in the present and has only a verybleak future to look forward to in the continuing cycle of birth and death.Thus, how can human beings who have seen these things and know them verywell continue to enjoy life like dogs, asses and goats? Often a dog will approacha bitch for sex, but the lady dog may not be attracted and will show her teeth,snarl and threaten the poor dog with serious injury. Still he goes about hisbusiness trying to get a little sex pleasure. Similarly, many times a dog risksbeing beaten or shot while stealing some food in a place where he knows heshould not go. The ass is very attracted to the she-ass, but the lady ass oftenkicks him in the legs. Similarly, the ass's master gives the ass a handful of grass,which the poor ass could get anywhere, and then burdens him with great loads.The goat is generally raised for slaughter, and even when the goat is broughtinto the slaughterhouse he shamelessly goes after the lady goat to get sexpleasure. In this way, even at the risk of being shot, bitten, beaten andslaughtered, animals persist in their foolish sense gratification. How can aneducated human being commit himself to such a condemned way of life,wherein the result is practically the same as that of the animals? If bycultivating the mode of goodness one's life is filled with happiness,enlightenment and future rewards, why would anyone cultivate the modes of passion and ignorance? This is Uddhava's question.</div>

In the Ninth Chapter, verse 37, the Lord ordered Brahmä to rigidlycarry out the Lord's injunctions and affirmed that Brahmä would thus never bebewildered in his cosmic decision-making. In the Sixth Chapter, verse 34, LordBrahmä assured his son Närada, "O Närada, because I have caught hold of thelotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, with great zeal,whatever I say has never proved to have been false, nor is the progress of mymind ever deterred, nor are my senses ever degraded by temporary attachment to matter."</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear brähmaëas, if, when asking Me who I am, you believe that I am also a jéva soul and that there is no ultimate difference between us—since all souls are ultimately one without individuality—then how is your question possible or appropriate? Ultimately, what is the real situation or resting place both of yourselves and of Me?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Äçraya means "the resting place" or "shelter." Lord Kåñëa's question "That isour actual resting place or shelter?" means "What is our ultimate nature orconstitutional position?" This is because no one can come to rest or be satisfiedunless one is in one's natural position. The example is given that one maytravel all over the world, but ultimately one becomes satisfied by returning toone's own home. Similarly, a crying child is satisfied when embraced by its ownmother. By inquiring about the shelter or resting place of Himself and thebrähmaëas, the Lord is indicating the eternal, constitutional position of every living entity</div>
<div class="First">If Lord Kåñëa were also in the jéva category, and if all living entitiesincluding Him were thus equal, there would be no deep purpose in one livingentity inquiring and another answering. Only one who is in a superior positioncan meaningfully answer important questions. It may be argued that the bonafide spiritual master answers all the questions of the disciple, and yet the guruis in the jéva category. The answer is that the bona fide spiritual master speaksnot on his own behalf but as a representative of the Supreme Personality ofGodhead, who is in the Viñëu category. A so-called guru speaking on his ownbehalf as a jéva soul is useless and is unable to meaningfully answer seriousquestions. Thus, the sages' question ko bhavän ("Who are You?") indicates thatthe Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally an individual person. Andbecause the sages headed by Lord Brahmä offered obeisances and worshipedthe Lord, it is understood that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Lord Brahmä, as the first created being in this universe, could not accept any other living entity except the Lord as worshipable.</div>
<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa's actual purpose is to explain the ultimate perfection of yoga,which the sages were desiring to know. If one becomes fixed in transcendentalknowledge, the mutual attraction between the material mind and the materialsense objects automatically ceases. The spiritual mind is not attracted tomaterial objects of gratification, and thus by spiritualizing the mind, materialexistence automatically slackens. By questioning the propriety of the sages'question, the Lord is assuming the position of the spiritual master andpreparing to give valuable instructions. One should never be envious of a bonafide spiritual master, especially if, as in the case of Lord Haàsa speaking to thesages headed by Brahmä and Sanaka-kumära, the guru is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.</div>

Thus, you should have asked, "Who are you five?"

Thus, it appears that in asking My identity, you are merely speaking words, without any real meaning or purpose.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains this verse as follows. "In theprevious verse Lord Kåñëa demonstrated that if the sages accepted theimpersonal philosophy that all living beings are ultimately one in all respects,their question 'Who are You?' was meaningless, since there would be nophilosophical basis to distinguish one manifestation of spirit soul from another.In this verse the Lord refutes the false identification with the material bodycomposed of five elements. If the sages accepted the body as the self, then theirquestion was meaningless, since they would have to ask, 'Who are you five?' Ifthe sages replied that although the body is composed basically of five elementsand these elements combine and thus form one unique substance, then theLord has already replied by the words samäneñu ca vastutaù. The bodies ofhuman beings, demigods, animals, etc., are all composed of the same fiveelements and are essentially the same. Therefore the question 'Who are You?'is ultimately meaningless. Thus, if one accepts either the theory that all livingentities are ultimately the same or the theory that all living entities areultimately nondifferent from their material bodies, in both cases the question of the sages is meaningless.</div>
<div class="First">"The sages might argue that even among learned persons it is commonpractice to ask questions and give answers on many subjects as a part of normallife. The sages could point out that Lord Kåñëa also distinguished among them,by His saying vipräù, 'O brähmaëas,' and vaù, or 'your [question],' as expressedin this verse. In this way it is seen that the Lord also accepts the ordinarycustoms of questions and answers. To answer this argument, Lord Kåñëa states,väcärambho hy anarthakaù. The Lord states, 'My addressing you as brähmaëas ismerely an exhibition of words if we are ultimately not different. I merelyreciprocated with your approach to Me. Therefore, if we are ultimately one,neither My statement nor your question has any real meaning. I can concludetherefore by your question to Me that you are all not actually very intelligent.Therefore, why are you inquiring after ultimate knowledge? Aren't you all embarrassed?'"</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Madhväcärya points out in this regard that the question of the sageswas not appropriate, since they had already seen their father, Lord Brahmä,worshiping the lotus feet of Lord Haàsa. Since their spiritual master andfather was worshiping Lord Haàsa, they should have immediately understoodthe Lord's position, and their question is thus meaningless.</div>

<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa has already explained that if the sages consider all livingentities to be the same, or if they consider the living entity to be the same ashis body, then their question ("Who are You?") is inappropriate. Now the Lordrefutes the conception that He is a Supreme God far beyond and differentfrom everything within this world. Modern agnostic philosophers preach thatGod created the world and then retired or went away. According to them, Godhas no tangible connection with this world, nor does He interfere in humanaffairs. Ultimately, they claim, God is so great that He cannot be known;therefore no one should waste time trying to understand God. To refute suchfoolish ideas, the Lord here explains that since everything is the expansion ofHis potency, He is not different from anything. Nothing can exist separatelyfrom the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus everything shares in theLord's nature, although some manifestations are superior and others inferior.The Lord is testing the intelligence of the sages by pointing out variouscontradictions in their questions.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa in the form of Haàsa-avatära, on the pretext of findingcontradictions in the simple inquiry of the sons of Brahmä ("Who are You?"), isactually preparing to teach the sages perfect spiritual knowledge, but only afterfirst rejecting two false concepts of life, namely that all living entities are thesame in all respects and that the living entity is identical with his outward orsubtle body. Lord Kåñëa now answers the difficult question that puzzled evenLord Brahmä. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the sons ofLord Brahmä were thinking as follows. "Our dear Lord, if it is indeed true thatwe are unintelligent, still Your Lordship has stated that You are actuallyeverything because everything is the expansion of Your potency. Therefore,You are also the mind and the sense objects, which are the subject matter ofour question. The material sense objects always enter into the functions of themind, and similarly, the mind always enters into the material sense objects.Thus, it is proper that we inquire from Your Lordship about the process bywhich the sense objects will no longer enter the mind and the mind will nolonger enter the sense objects. Please be merciful and give us the answer." TheLord answers as follows. "My dear sons, it is a fact that the mind enters into thematerial sense objects and the sense objects into the mind. Thus, although theliving entity is actually part and parcel of Me, being, as I am also, eternallyconscious, and although the eternal form of the living entity is spiritual, inconditioned life the living entity artificially imposes upon himself the mindand sense objects, which act as covering designations of the eternal soul. Sinceit is the natural function of the material mind and sense objects to mutuallyinteract, how can you possibly endeavor to prevent such a mutual attraction?Since both the material mind and sense objects are useless, they both should becompletely given up, and thus automatically you will be free from all material duality."</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Çrédhara Svämé points out that the symptom of the material mind isthe tendency to consider oneself to be the ultimate doer and enjoyer.Naturally, one with such a puffed-up mentality is helplessly attracted by thesense objects. One who considers himself to be the doer and enjoyer will beirresistibly attracted to the means for attaining sense gratification and falseprestige, namely, exploitation of material objects. Above the material mind,however, is intelligence, which can perceive the existence of the eternal spiritsoul. It is not possible to separate the material mind from the sense objects,because they naturally exist together. Therefore, by intelligence, one mustrealize one's eternal form as spirit soul, part and parcel of the Lord, andcompletely reject the bogus material mentality. One who revives his originalspiritual mentality becomes automatically detached from material attraction.Therefore, one should cultivate knowledge of the falsity of sense gratification.When the mind or senses are attracted to material enjoyment, the superiorintelligence must immediately detect such illusion. In this way, one shouldpurify one's mentality. By devotional service to the Lord, such detachment andintelligence automatically awaken, and by full understanding of one's originalspiritual form, one is properly situated in eternal consciousness.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> A person who has thus achieved Me by understanding that he is not different from Me realizes that the material mind is lodged within the sense objects because of constant sense gratification, and that the material objects are existing prominently within the material mind. Having understood My transcendental nature, he gives up both the material mind and its objects.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Lord again states here that it is most difficult to separate the materialmind from its objects because the material mind by definition considers itselfto be the doer and enjoyer of everything. It must be understood that giving upthe material mind does not mean giving up all mental activities, but insteadmeans purifying the mind and engaging one's enlightened mentality in thedevotional service of the Lord. Since time immemorial the material mind andsenses have been in contact with the sense objects; therefore, how is it possiblefor the material mind to give up its objects, which are the basis of its existence?And not only does the mind reach out to material objects, but also, because ofthe mind's desires, the material objects cannot remain out of the mind,helplessly entering at every moment. Thus, separation between the mind andsense objects is not actually feasible, nor does it serve any purpose. If oneretains a material mentality, considering oneself to be supreme, one mayrenounce sense gratification, considering it to be ultimately the cause ofunhappiness, but one will not be able to remain on such an artificial platform,nor will such renunciation serve any real purpose. Without surrender to thelotus feet of the Lord, mere renunciation cannot take one out of this material world.</div>
<div class="First">Just as the sun's rays are part of the sun, the living entities are part of theSupreme Personality of Godhead. When the living entity is completelyabsorbed in his identity as the part and parcel of the Personality of Godhead,he becomes actually wise and easily gives up the material mind and senseobjects. The word mad-rüpaù in this verse indicates absorption of the mind inthe form, qualities, pastimes and associates of the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. Immersed in such ecstatic meditation, one should render devotionalservice to the Lord, and this will automatically drive away the influence ofsense gratification. By himself, the living entity does not have the potency togive up his false identification with the material mind and sense objects, but byworshiping the Lord in the mood of being His eternal part-and-parcel servant,one is infused with the Lord's potency, which easily drives away the darkness of ignorance.</div>

<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa now specifically answers the questions that the sages originallyplaced before Lord Brahmä. Ultimately, the spirit soul has nothing to do withthe material sense objects and modes of nature. But because of one's falseidentification with the material body, the modes of nature are empowered toengage one in illusory occupations. By destroying this false identification withmatter, the soul gives up the illusory occupations awarded by the modes ofnature. It is clearly stated in this verse that the living entity is not empoweredto independently free himself from illusion, but must situate himself in Kåñëaconsciousness, in full awareness of the Supreme Lord.</div>

"How does material existencecause the bondage of the living entity, and how can such bondage be given up?The Lord explains this here by the word ahaìkära-kåtam. Because of false ego,one is bound up in the network of illusion. Artha-viparyayam indicates thatalthough the living entity desires blissful life, eternity and knowledge, headopts procedures that actually cover over his eternal, blissful nature and givehim exactly the opposite result. The living entity does not want death andsuffering, but these are actually the results of material existence, which istherefore useless for all practical purposes. An intelligent person shouldcontemplate the unhappiness of material life and thus become situated in thetranscendental Lord.

<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura comments as follows: "Although LordKåñëa in His form of Haàsa-avatära has condemned the intelligence that seesduality and separate values within the material world, the Vedas themselvesinstitute the system of varëäçrama-dharma, by which the entire human societyis divided into different castes, occupations and spiritual statuses. Therefore,how can the Lord recommend that one give up one's faith in this Vedicsystem? The answer is given in this verse as follows. The words anyeñäàbhävänäm, or 'of other states of existence,' refer to the innumerable divisionsof false identification with the material body, mind, occupation, and so on.Such identification is illusion, and the material divisions of the varëäçramasystem are certainly based on this illusion. The Vedic literatures promiseheavenly rewards such as residence in upper planetary systems and prescribethe means to acquire such rewards. However, both the rewards and the meansfor achieving them are ultimately illusion. Since this world is the Lord'screation, one cannot deny that its existence is also real; yet the living entitywho identifies the creations of this world as belonging to himself is certainly inillusion. The example may be given that horns are real and rabbits are real, butif one imagines a rabbit's horns, that is certainly illusion, though a rabbit'shorns may occur in a dream. Similarly, the living entity dreams of a permanentrelationship within the material world. One may dream that one is feasting onsumptuous sweet rice prepared with milk and sugar, but there is no actual nutritional value in the dream of royal feasting."</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura remarks in this regard that just asone soon forgets the experience of a dream after awakening, similarly, aliberated soul in Kåñëa consciousness does not see anything substantial in eventhe most exalted rewards offered by the Vedas, such as promotion to theheavenly planets. Therefore Lord Kåñëa advised Arjuna in Bhagavad-gétä toremain fixed in self-realization, without being deviated by fruitive rituals performed in the name of religion.</div>

One mayfirst consider the three phases of consciousness mentioned above and thenunderstand one's own transcendental position as spirit soul. One experienceschildhood, boyhood, adolescence, adulthood, middle age and old age, andthroughout these phases one is experiencing things while awake and whiledreaming. Similarly, one may, by careful intelligence, understand one's lack ofconsciousness during deep sleep, and thus through intelligence one may have experience of lack of consciousness.</div>
<div class="First">One may argue that it is actually the senses that experience duringwakefulness and that it is the mind that experiences during dreams. However,the Lord here states, indriyeçaù: the living entity is actually the lord of thesenses and mind, although temporarily he has become a victim of theirinfluence. By Kåñëa consciousness one may resume one's rightful position asmaster of the mental and sensory faculties. Also, since the living entity canremember his experiences in these three stages of consciousness, he isultimately the experiencing agent or the seer of all phases of consciousness. Heremembers, "I saw so many things in my dream, and then my dream ended andI didn't see anything. Now I'm waking up."

<div class="Translation"> Just as a drunken man does not notice if he is wearing his coat or shirt, similarly, one who is perfect in self-realization and who has thus achieved his eternal identity does not notice whether the temporary body is sitting or standing. Indeed, if by God's will the body is finished or if by God's will he obtains a new body, a self-realized soul does not notice, just as a drunken man does not notice the situation of his outward dress.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">A Kåñëa conscious person who has achieved his spiritual identity does notaccept sense gratification in the material world as the goal of his life. He isconstantly engaged in the service of the Lord and knows that the temporarybody and flickering mind are material. By superior intelligence in Kåñëaconsciousness he remains engaged in the Lord's service. The example of adrunken man in this verse is very nice. It is common knowledge that atmundane social gatherings men become drunk and lose all awareness of theirexternal situation. Similarly, a liberated soul has already achieved his spiritualbody and therefore knows that his continued existence does not depend on thematerial body. A liberated soul does not, however, inflict punishment on thebody but rather remains neutral, naturally accepting his destiny as the will of the Supreme.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The material body certainly moves under the control of supreme destiny and therefore must continue to live along with the senses and vital air as long as one's karma is in effect.

At that time the body will automatically dieaccording to destiny. The following doubt may then arise: If a Kåñëa consciousperson pays proper attention to the maintenance of the body, is there dangerof again becoming attached to it? Lord Kåñëa here states that one who is highlyelevated in Kåñëa consciousness, having understood Lord Kåñëa to be theactual vastu, or reality, never again surrenders to the illusory identificationwith the material body, which is just like the body seen in a dream.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Because in the previous verse Lord Kåñëa explained His exalted nature, thesons of Brahmä might have slightly doubted the Lord's position, thinking thatthey had detected some pride within the Lord's mind. Therefore, they mayhave doubted the instructions they had just received from Lord Haàsa.Anticipating any such reluctance, the Lord immediately clarifies the situationin the present verse. The Lord explains that, unlike ordinary living entitieseven up to the standard of Brahmä, the Lord's transcendental body is notdifferent from His eternal Self and has no material qualities such as falseegotism. The Lord's transcendental form is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss,and is thus nirguëam, beyond the modes of nature. Because the Lordcompletely ignores the so-called enjoyment offered by the illusory energy, Heis called nirapekñakam, and being the best well-wisher of His devotees, He iscalled suhådam. Priyam indicates that the Lord is the supreme lovable objectand that He establishes wonderful affectionate relationships with Hisdevotees. Sämya indicates that the Lord is neutral and detached in all materialsituations. These and other exalted qualities find their shelter and worshipableobject in the Lord, who does not take material designations into considerationbut awards His mercy to anyone who takes shelter of Him. InÇrémad-Bhägavatam (1.16.26-30) mother Bhümi, the predominating deity of theearth, gives a list of some of the Lord's transcendental qualities, and even moreare found in The Nectar of Devotion. Actually, the Lord's qualities areunlimited, but a small sample is given here simply to establish the Lord's transcendental position.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted from the Käla-saàhitä as follows.

<div class="Chapnum">14. Lord Kåñëa Explains the Yoga System to Çré Uddhava</div>
<div class="First">In this chapter, Kåñëa explains that devotional service to the Supreme Lordis the most excellent method of spiritual practice. He also speaks about the process of meditation.</div>
<div class="First">Çré Uddhava wanted to know which process of spiritual advancement is thebest. He also desired to hear about the superexcellence of devotional servicefree from ulterior motives. The Supreme Personality of Godhead replied tohim that the original process of religion revealed in the Vedas had become lostduring the time of annihilation. At the beginning of the new creation,therefore, the Supreme Lord spoke it again to Brahmä. Brahmä repeated it toManu, Manu spoke it to the sages headed by Bhågu Muni, and these sages inturn instructed this eternal religion to the demigods and demons. Because ofthe living entities' multitude of diverse desires, this system of religion waselaborately explained in different ways. Thus different philosophies arose,including various atheistic doctrines. Because the living entity, bewildered byillusion, is incapable of ascertaining his eternal benefit, he mistakenlyidentifies ordinary vows of penance, austerity, etc., to be the topmost spiritualpractice. But the only true means of achieving happiness is to meditate onoffering everything to the Supreme Lord. In this way one becomes free from alldesires for selfish gratification through enjoyment of mundane sense objects,and he becomes released from all hankering for either enjoyment or liberation.The Lord then proceeded to describe the superior process of devotionalservice, which destroys countless sinful reactions and produces manysymptoms of spiritual happiness, such as the standing of the hairs on end. Puredevotion, having the power to purify the heart, enables one to achieve theassociation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and because the devotee isvery dear to the Lord and is always close to Him, he is able in turn to purify theentire universe. By virtue of his unflinching devotion to the Lord, the devoteecan never be completely diverted by the objects of sense enjoyment, even if heis not able to gain control over his senses in the beginning. One desiring toattain the perfection of life is advised to give up all material processes ofelevation as well as the association of women. He should then merge his mindconstantly in thought of Lord Kåñëa. Finally, the Lord instructed Çré Uddhava about the true object of meditation.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In order to clearly establish the exalted position of bhakti-yoga, or puredevotional service to the Supreme Lord, Çré Uddhava requests Lord Kåñëa toidentify the supreme among all processes of self-realization. Not all Vedicprocesses lead directly to the ultimate goal, pure love of God; some onlygradually elevate the consciousness of the living entity. For the purpose ofgiving a general outline of the process of self-realization, sages may discuss thevarious methods of elevation. But when the time comes to ascertain the mostperfect process, the secondary methods must be cleared from the path.</div>

<div class="First">It is now clearly established that pure devotional service is the supremeprocess for fixing the mind in the Supreme Truth, Lord Kåñëa. The next pointto be clarified is this: Can everyone practice this process, or is it limited to anelite class of transcendentalists? In discussing the relative advantages ofdifferent spiritual processes, one must immediately ascertain the goal ofspiritual life and then isolate the process that actually awards this goal.Processes must be defined in terms of primary and secondary functions. Amethod that gives one the highest perfection is primary, whereas processesthat merely assist or enhance the primary function are considered secondary.The mind is most flickering and unsteady; therefore by clear intelligence onemust fix oneself in a progressive mode of life, and thus one can achieve theAbsolute Truth in this lifetime. This is the sober purpose of Lord Kåñëa's conversation with Çré Uddhava.</div>

<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa explains to Uddhava that although many processes andconcepts of spiritual realization are described in the Vedas, the Vedasultimately recommend devotional service to the Supreme Lord. Lord Kåñëa isthe reservoir of all pleasure, and His devotees directly enter into the Lord'shlädiné, or pleasure-giving, potency. Somehow or other one must fix one's mindin Lord Kåñëa, and that is not possible without devotional service. One whohas not developed his attraction to Lord Kåñëa cannot restrain the senses frominferior engagements. Since other Vedic processes do not actually award LordKåñëa to the practitioner, they cannot offer the highest benefit in life. Thetranscendental sound of the Vedas is itself the highest evidence, but one whosesenses and mind are entangled in sense gratification and mental speculation,and whose heart is therefore covered by material dust, cannot directly receivethe transcendental Vedic message. Thus one cannot appreciate the exalted position of devotional service to the Lord.</div>

Other processes aremeant for those whose nature is still affected by the material modes, and thussuch processes, along with their results, are themselves also materiallycontaminated. Devotional service to the Lord, however, is a pure spiritualprocess, and by executing it with a pure consciousness one comes directly intouch with the Personality of Godhead, who describes Himself inBhagavad-gétä (9.2) as pavitram idam uttamam, the supreme pure. The systemof paramparä, or disciplic succession, is illustrated in this and the previousverse. The spiritual masters in Caitanya Mahäprabhu's movement are part ofsuch a disciplic succession, and through them the same Vedic knowledge spoken by Brahmä to Manu is still available.</div>

Bhågu, Maréci,Atri, Aìgirä, Pulastya, Pulaha and Kratu are the seven great brähmaëa sagesand forefathers of this universe. The Kindevas are a race of human beings whoare, like the demigods, completely free from fatigue, sweat and body odor.Seeing them, one may thus ask, kià deväù: "Are they demigods?" Actually, theyare human beings living on another planet within the universe. The Kinnarasare so called because they are kiïcin naräù, or "a little like human beings." TheKinnaras have either a human head or human body (but not both) combinedwith a nonhuman form. The Kimpuruñas are so called because they resemblehuman beings and thus prompt the question kià puruñäù: "Are these humanbeings?" Actually, they are a race of monkeys who are almost like human beings.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Unlike the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the individual living entity isnot omniscient, therefore his activities and pleasures do not represent thewhole truth. According to one's individual way of doing things (yathä-karma)and one's personal preference (yathä-ruci), one speaks to others about what isgood for them. Everyone thinks, "What is good for me is good for everyone."Actually, the best thing for everyone is to surrender to the SupremePersonality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa, and thus realize one's eternal nature ofbliss and knowledge. Without knowledge of the Absolute Truth, manyso-called learned people are whimsically advising other whimsical people whoalso lack perfect knowledge of the actual goal of life.</div>

Çréla ViçvanäthaCakravarté Öhäkura gives the example that when a very wealthy man travelsall over the world, at every place he stays he always enjoys the same luxuriousstandard of comfort. Similarly, one who has developed Kåñëa consciousness isnever separated from happiness, because Lord Kåñëa is all-pervading. The wordkiïcana indicates the so-called enjoyable things of this world. One who isakiïcana has correctly understood that material sense gratification is simplythe glare of illusion, and therefore such a person is däntasya, or self-controlled,çäntasya, or peaceful, and mayä santuñöa-manasaù, or completely satisfied withhis transcendental experience of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

None of these personalities—even the Lord's ownself—are as dear to Him as His pure devotee Uddhava, an akiïcana devotee ofthe Lord. Çréla Madhväcärya cites from Vedic literature the example that agentleman sometimes neglects his own interest and that of his children to givecharity to a poor beggar. Similarly, the Lord gives preference to a helplessdevotee who depends completely on His mercy. The only way to obtain theLord's mercy is through His causeless love, and the Lord is most lovinglyinclined toward those devotees who are most dependent on Him, just asordinary mothers and fathers worry more about their helpless children thanabout those who are self-sufficient. Thus even if one lacks any materialqualification, one should simply depend upon the Supreme Personality ofGodhead, without any other interest, and surely one will achieve the highest perfection of life.</div>

All thematerial universes are situated in Çré Kåñëa's body, as demonstrated to Arjuna,mother Yaçodä and others. Lord Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead,and therefore there is no question of impurity in the Lord. Still, the Lorddesires to purify the universes situated within Him by taking the dust of thelotus feet of His pure devotees. Without the dust of the lotus feet of thedevotees, it is not possible to engage in pure devotional service, without whichone cannot directly experience transcendental bliss. Lord Kåñëa thought, "Ihave established this strict rule that one can enjoy My transcendental blissonly through devotional service obtained from the dust of the lotus feet of Mydevotees. Since I also desire to experience My own bliss, I will observe thestandard procedure and accept the dust of My devotees' feet." ÇrélaMadhväcärya points out that Lord Kåñëa follows the footsteps of His devoteesin order to purify them. As the Lord walks along behind His pure devotees, thewind blows the dust of the Lord's feet in the front of His devotees, who thenbecome purified by contact with such transcendental dust. One should notfoolishly look for material logic in these transcendental pastimes of the Lord. Itis simply a question of love between the Lord and His devotees.</div>

<div class="First">Abhibhüyate indicates falling down into the material world and beingdefeated by mäyä. But even though one's senses are not fully conquered, onewho has unflinching devotion for Lord Kåñëa does not run the risk of beingseparated from Him. The words pragalbhayä bhaktyä indicate a person who hasgreat devotion for Lord Kåñëa, and not one who desires to commit sinfulactivities and chant Hare Kåñëa to avoid the reaction. Because of previous badhabits and immaturity, even a sincere devotee may be harassed by lingeringattraction to the bodily concept of life; but his unflinching devotion for LordKåñëa will act. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura gives the following twoexamples. A great warrior may be struck by the weapon of his enemy, butbecause of his courage and strength he is not killed or defeated. He accepts theblow and goes on to victory. Similarly, one may contract a serious disease, but if he takes the proper medicine he is quickly cured.</div>
<div class="First">If those who follow the impersonal system of speculation and austeritydeviate even slightly from their path, they fall down. A devotee, however,even though immature, never falls from the path of devotional service.

As stated in theprevious verse, a sincere loving devotee, because of immaturity or previous badhabits, may be disturbed by his senses even though he has accepted Lord Kåñëaas the only goal in his life. But if even by chance the devotee accidentally fallsdown without premeditation or indifference, the Lord immediately burns toashes his sinful reactions, just as a blazing fire immediately consumes aninsignificant piece of wood. Lord Kåñëa is glorious, and one who takesexclusive shelter of the Lord receives the unique benefits of devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Neither religious activities endowed with honesty and mercy nor knowledge obtained with great penance can completely purify one's consciousness if they are bereft of loving service to Me.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Although pious religious work, truthfulness, mercy, penances andknowledge partially purify one's existence, they do not take out the root ofmaterial desires. Thus the same desires will reappear at a later time. After anextensive program of material gratification, one becomes eager to performausterities, acquire knowledge, perform selfless work and in general purifyone's existence. After sufficient piety and purification, however, one againbecomes eager for material enjoyment. When clearing an agricultural field onemust uproot the unwanted plants, otherwise with the coming of raineverything will grow back as it was. Pure devotional service to the Lorduproots one's material desires, so that there is no danger of relapsing into adegraded life of material gratification. In the eternal kingdom of God, lovingreciprocation between the Lord and His devotees is manifest. One who has notcome to this stage of enlightenment must remain on the material platform,which is always full of discrepancies and contradictions. Thus everything isincomplete and imperfect without loving service to the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> If one's hairs do not stand on end, how can the heart melt? And if the heart does not melt, how can tears of love flow from the eyes? If one does not cry in spiritual happiness, how can one render loving service to the Lord? And without such service, how can the consciousness be purified?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Loving service to the Lord is the only process that can completely purifyone's consciousness; such service produces waves of ecstatic love thatcompletely cleanse the soul. As mentioned earlier by Lord Kåñëa to ÇréUddhava, other processes such as self-control, pious activities, mystic yoga,penances, etc., certainly purify the mind, as stated in many authorizedliteratures. Such processes, however, do not completely remove the desire toperform forbidden activities. But pure devotional service rendered in love ofGodhead is so powerful that it burns to ashes any obstacle encountered on thepath of progress. The Lord has stated in this chapter that loving service to Himis a blazing fire that burns to ashes all impediments. In contrast, the small firesof mental speculation or mystic yoga can be extinguished by sinful desires atany moment. Thus, by hearing Çrémad-Bhägavatam one should ignite theblazing fire of loving service to the Lord and burn to ashes the network of material illusion.</div>

<div class="Translation"> A devotee whose speech is sometimes choked up, whose heart melts, who cries continually and sometimes laughs, who feels ashamed and cries out loudly and then dances—a devotee thus fixed in loving service to Me purifies the entire universe.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Väg gadgadä refers to a highly emotional state in which the throat is chokedup and one cannot express oneself. Vilajjaù indicates that a devotee sometimesfeels embarrassment due to bodily functions and memories of past sinfulactivities. In this condition, a devotee loudly cries out the holy name of Kåñëaand sometimes dances in ecstasy. As stated here, such a devotee purifies the three worlds.</div>
<div class="First">By melting of the heart, one becomes very steady in spiritual life. Normally,one whose heart easily melts is thought to be unsteady; but because Lord Kåñëais the stable foundation of all existence, one whose heart melts in love ofKåñëa becomes most stable and cannot be disturbed by opposing arguments,bodily suffering, mental problems, supernatural disasters or the interference ofenvious persons. Because such a devotee is fixed in loving service to the Lord,he becomes the very heart of the Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Just as gold, when smelted in fire, gives up its impurities and returns to its pure brilliant state, similarly, the spirit soul, absorbed in the fire of bhakti-yoga, is purified of all contamination caused by previous fruitive activities and returns to its original position of serving Me in the spiritual world.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, this verse indicatesthat the devotee goes back home, back to Godhead, and there worships LordKåñëa in his original spiritual body, which is compared to the original pureform of smelted gold. Gold alloyed with inferior metals cannot be purified bywater and soap; similarly, the heart's impurities cannot be removed bysuperficial processes. Only the fire of love of Godhead can cleanse one's souland send one back home, back to Godhead, to engage in eternal loving service to the Lord.</div>

<div class="First">The Lord is called sükñmam because He is pure spiritual consciousness,without any tinge of material energy. If one chants and hears the holy nameand glories of Kåñëa with great sincerity, there is immediately a transcendentaleffect. We can immediately see the spiritual world and pastimes of the Lord ifwe fully surrender to the process mentioned here. A blind person feelsperpetual gratitude to a doctor who restores his sight. Similarly, we singcakñu-däna dila ye, janme janme prabhu sei: the bona fide spiritual master, therepresentative of Lord Kåñëa, restores our spiritual sight, and thus he is our eternal lord and master.</div>

<div class="First">One should not think that one can attain complete transcendentalknowledge of Kåñëa by mechanically engaging in worship of the Lord. LordKåñëa states here that one must endeavor constantly to keep the Lord withinone's mind. Anusmarataù, or constant remembrance, is possible for one whoalways chants and hears the glories of Lord Kåñëa. It is therefore stated,çravaëam, kértanam [SB 7.5.23], smaraëam: the process of devotional servicebegins with hearing (çravaëam) and chanting (kértanam), from whichremembrance (smaraëam) develops. One who constantly thinks of the objectsof material gratification becomes attached to them; similarly, one whoconstantly keeps Lord Kåñëa within his mind becomes absorbed in the Lord'stranscendental nature and thus becomes qualified to render personal service to the Lord in His own abode.</div>

Without fear offailure or of unhappiness in life, one should remain with sincere devotees ofthe Lord. Atandrita means that one should not compromise this principle butshould be rigid and cautious.

<div class="First">One should make a great endeavor to give up intimate contact with womenand those fond of women. A learned gentleman will automatically be on guardif placed in intimate contact with lusty women. In the company of lusty men,,however, the same man may engage in all kinds of social dealings and thus becontaminated by their polluted mentality. Association with lusty men is oftenmore dangerous than association with women and should be avoided by allmeans. There are innumerable verses in the Bhägavatam describing theintoxication of material lust. Suffice it to say that a lusty man becomes exactlylike a dancing dog and, by the influence of Cupid, loses all gravity, intelligenceand direction in life. The Lord warns here that one who surrenders to theillusory form of a woman suffers unbearably in this life and the next.</div>

<div class="First">It has already been elaborately explained by the Supreme Lord that withoutloving devotional service rendered to Him in the association of devotees, noother process of self-realization will work. Therefore it may be asked whyUddhava is again referring to the system of meditation, dhyäna. The äcäryasexplain that one cannot fully appreciate the beauty and perfection ofbhakti-yoga unless one sees its superiority to all other processes. Throughcomparative analysis, the devotees become fully ecstatic in their appreciationof bhakti-yoga. It should also be understood that although Uddhava asks aboutthose who aspire for liberation, he is not actually a mumukñu, or salvationist;rather, he is asking questions for the benefit of those who are not on theplatform of love of Godhead. Uddhava wants to hear this knowledge for hispersonal appreciation and so that those who pursue salvation, or liberation,can be protected and redirected to the path of pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Keeping the eyes half closed and fixed on the tip of one's nose, being enlivened and alert, one should meditate on the lotus flower situated within the heart. This lotus has eight petals and is situated on an erect lotus stalk. One should meditate on the sun, moon and fire, placing them one after the other within the whorl of that lotus flower. Placing My transcendental form within the fire, one should meditate upon it as the auspicious goal of all meditation. That form is perfectly proportioned, gentle and cheerful. It possesses four beautiful long arms, a charming, beautiful neck, a handsome forehead, a pure smile and glowing, shark-shaped earrings suspended from two identical ears. That spiritual form is the color of a dark rain cloud and is garbed in golden-yellowish silk. The chest of that form is the abode of Çrévatsa and the goddess of fortune, and that form is also decorated with a conchshell, disc, club, lotus flower and garland of forest flowers. The two brilliant lotus feet are decorated with ankle bells and bracelets, and that form exhibits the Kaustubha gem along with an effulgent crown. The upper hips are beautified by a golden belt, and the arms are decorated with valuable bracelets. All of the limbs of that beautiful form capture the heart, and the face is beautified by merciful glancing. Pulling the senses back from the sense objects, one should be grave and self-controlled and should use the intelligence to strongly fix the mind upon all of the limbs of My transcendental body. Thus one should meditate upon that most delicate transcendental form of Mine.</div>

<div class="First">As one becomes established in pure consciousness, the duality of "I ammeditating and this is the object of my meditation" vanishes, and one comes tothe stage of spontaneous relationship with the Personality of Godhead. Everyliving entity is originally part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, and when thatforgotten eternal relationship is revived one experiences remembrance of theAbsolute Truth. In that stage, described here as mad-ärohaù, one no longersees oneself as a meditator nor the Lord as a mere object of meditation, butrather one enters the spiritual sky for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge in direct loving relationship with the Lord.</div>
<div class="First">Uddhava originally inquired about the procedure of meditation for thosedesiring liberation. The word labdha-padam indicates that when one fixes themind upon the Lord's face, one achieves full liberation. In the postliberationphase one then proceeds to render service to the original Personality ofGodhead. By giving up the concept of being a meditator, one casts off the lastsmall remnant of illusory energy and sees the Lord as He actually is.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Because of false material identification, we accept our own body and mind,the bodies and minds of others, and supernatural material control to beultimate realities. Supernatural control refers to the bodies and minds of thedemigods, who ultimately are humble servitors of the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. Even the mighty sun, which displays immense potencies, obedientlytreads its universal path by the order of Lord Kåñëa.It is clearly seen in this chapter that haöha-yoga, karma-yoga, räja-yoga, etc.,are part and parcel of bhakti-yoga and do not actually exist separately. The goalof life is Lord Kåñëa, and one must eventually come to the stage of puredevotion if one desires to perfect one's meditation or yoga practice. In themature stage of devotion, as described in this chapter, one becomes free fromthe artificial duality of meditator and object of meditation, and onespontaneously engages in hearing about and glorifying the Supreme AbsoluteTruth. Such activities of bhakti-yoga are natural because they spring fromspontaneous love. When one revives one's original nature as the lovingservitor of Lord Kåñëa, other yoga processes cease to be interesting. Uddhavawas a pure devotee even before the Lord began His instruction; therefore itwas not expected that Uddhava would give up the supreme platform of being apersonal associate of the Lord to take up the mechanical exercises of the yogasystem. Bhakti-yoga, or devotional service, is so elevated that even in thebeginning stages of practice one is considered liberated, because all of one'sactivities are executed under proper guidance for the pleasure of the Lord. Inthe haöha-yoga system one is concerned with bodily control, and in jïäna-yogaone is concerned with speculative knowledge. In both systems one endeavorsselfishly, desiring to become a great yogé or a philosopher. Such egoistic activityis described in this verse as kriyä. One must give up the illusory designations ofdravya, jïäna and kriyä and come to the prideless stage of loving service to the Lord.</div>

In conclusion, Kåñëa states that for one who desires toperform pure devotional service to the Personality of Godhead, theachievement of these mystic perfections is a waste of time, because theydistract one from proper worship. All these perfections are automaticallyoffered to a pure devotee, but he does not accept them. Unless used in the yogaof devotional service, these perfections are valueless. A devotee simply seesthat the Personality of Godhead is always present everywhere, both externally and internally, and depends completely upon Him.</div>

Lord Kåñëa is naturally the shelter of the eight primary mysticpotencies and meditations because such perfections emanate from the Lord'spersonal potency, and thus they are fully developed only within the LordHimself and the Lord's personal associates. When materialistic personsmechanically acquire such potencies, the perfections awarded are of aninferior degree and are considered to be manifestations of mäyä, illusion. Apure devotee of the Lord automatically receives from the Lord wonderfulpotencies to execute his devotional service. If for sense gratification onemechanically endeavors to acquire mystic perfections, then these perfectionsare certainly considered to be inferior expansions of the Lord's external potency.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Among the eight primary mystic perfections, the three by which one transforms one's own body are aëimä, becoming smaller than the smallest; mahimä, becoming greater than the greatest; and laghimä, becoming lighter than the lightest. Through the perfection of präpti one acquires whatever one desires, and through präkämya-siddhi one experiences any enjoyable object, either in this world or the next. Through içitä-siddhi one can manipulate the subpotencies of mäyä, and through the controlling potency called vaçitä-siddhi one is unimpeded by the three modes of nature. One who has acquired kämävasäyitä-siddhi can obtain anything from anywhere, to the highest possible limit. My dear gentle Uddhava, these eight mystic perfections are considered to be naturally existing and unexcelled within this world.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Through aëimä-siddhi one can become so small that one can enter a stoneor pass through any obstacle. Through mahimä-siddhi one becomes so greatthat one covers everything, and through laghimä one becomes so light that onecan ride on the sun's rays into the sun planet. Through präpti-siddhi one canacquire anything from anywhere and can even touch the moon with one'sfinger. By this mystic perfection one can also enter into the senses of any otherliving entity through the predominating deities of the particular senses; and bythus utilizing the senses of others, one can acquire anything. Throughpräkämya one can experience any enjoyable object, either in this world or thenext, and through éçitä, or the controlling potency, one can manipulate thesubpotencies of mäyä, which are material. In other words, even by acquiringmystic powers one cannot pass beyond the control of illusion; however, onemay manipulate the subpotencies of illusion. Through vaçitä, or the power tocontrol, one can bring others under one's dominion or keep oneself beyond thecontrol of the three modes of nature. Ultimately, one acquires throughkämävasäyitä the maximum powers of control, acquisition and enjoyment. Theword autpattikäù in this verse indicates being original, natural and unexcelled.These eight mystic potencies originally exist in the Supreme Personality ofGodhead, Kåñëa, in the superlative degree. Lord Kåñëa becomes so small thatHe enters within the atomic particles, and He becomes so large that asMahä-Viñëu He breathes out millions of universes. The Lord can become solight or subtle that even great mystic yogés cannot perceive Him, and the Lord'sacquisitive power is perfect, because He keeps the total existence eternallywithin His body. The Lord certainly can enjoy whatever He likes, control allenergies, dominate all other persons and exhibit complete omnipotency.Therefore it is to be understood that these eight mystic perfections areinsignificant expansions of the mystic potency of the Lord, who inBhagavad-gétä is called Yogeçvara, the Supreme Lord of all mystic potencies.These eight perfections are not artificial, but are natural and unexcelledbecause they originally exist in the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation"> One who absorbs his mind in the particular form of the mahat-tattva and thus meditates upon Me as the Supreme Soul of the total material existence achieves the mystic perfection called mahimä. By further absorbing the mind in the situation of each individual element such as the sky, air, fire, and so on, one progressively acquires the greatness of each material element.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">There are innumerable verses in Vedic literatures explaining that theSupreme Personality of Godhead is qualitatively not different from Hiscreation and thus a yogé may meditate upon the total material existence as amanifestation of the external potency of the Lord. Once the yogé hasestablished his realization that the material creation is not different from theLord, he obtains the perfection called mahimä-siddhi. By realizing the Lord'spresence in each individual element the yogé also acquires the greatness ofeach element. However, the pure devotees are not very interested in suchperfections because they are surrendered to the Personality of Godhead, whoexhibits such perfections to the infinite degree. Being always protected by theLord, the pure devotees save their precious time to chant Hare Kåñëa, HareKåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, HareHare. Thus they achieve for themselves and others saàsiddhi, or the supremeperfection, pure love of Godhead, Kåñëa consciousness, by which one expandsone's existence beyond the total material creation to the spiritual planets called Vaikuëöha.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çrémad-Bhägavatam elaborately explains that käla, or time, is thetranscendental form of the Lord that moves the material world. Since the fivegross elements are composed of atoms, the atomic particles are the subtlesubstance or manifestation of the movements of time. More subtle than time isthe Personality of Godhead Himself, who expands His potency as the timefactor. By understanding all these things clearly the yogé obtainslaghimä-siddhi, or the power to make himself lighter than the lightest.</div>

Prahläda Mahäräja was attacked by his father in all theseways, but because of his perfect Kåñëa consciousness he was not injured. Thepure devotees of the Lord depend fully on the mercy of Lord Kåñëa, whopossesses mystic opulences to an infinite degree and is therefore known asYogeçvara, the master of all mystic power. Because devotees are alwaysconnected to Lord Kåñëa, they do not feel any need to separately developpowers already possessed unlimitedly by their Lord, master and protector.If a human being falls into the middle of the ocean he quickly drowns,whereas the fish enjoy happiness sporting in the same waves.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">By taking birth as a demigod one is automatically endowed with manymystic perfections. Simply by birth on Siddhaloka one automatically acquiresall of the eight principal perfections of yoga. Similarly, by birth as a fish onebecomes invulnerable to water, by birth as a bird one gets the mysticperfection of flying, and by birth as a ghost one gets the mystic perfection ofdisappearing and entering into the bodies of others. Pataïjali Muni states thatthe mystic perfections of yoga can be achieved by birth, herbs, austerities andmantras. The Lord states, however, that such perfections are ultimately a wasteof time and an impediment to achieving the actual perfection of yoga, Kåñëa consciousness.</div>
<div class="First">Those who give up the process of bhakti-yoga and shop around for otherobjects of meditation besides Kåñëa are certainly not very intelligent. Thosewho claim to be yogés but pursue the satisfaction of their own senses arecertainly kuyogés, or bhogi-yogés. Such kuyogés cannot understand that just asthey have tiny senses, the Absolute Truth has absolute senses, nor can theyunderstand that yoga is actually meant to satisfy the absolute senses of theLord. Therefore, persons who give up the lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa in order topursue so-called happiness in mystic perfection will undoubtedly be frustratedin their attempt. By meditating exclusively on the Supreme Personality ofGodhead one can achieve yoga-gati, the ultimate goal of yoga, which meansliving on Lord Kåñëa's planet and there enjoying spiritual opulences.</div>

<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa is the entire basis of meditation for all yogés and philosophers,and here the Lord clarifies His absolute position. Since the Lord is withineverything, one might think that the Lord is divided into pieces. However, theword anävåta, or "completely uncovered," indicates that nothing can interrupt,disturb or in any way infringe upon the supreme existence of the AbsoluteTruth, the Personality of Godhead. There is no actual separation between theinternal and external existence of the material elements, which continuouslyexist everywhere. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead isall-pervading and is the ultimate perfection of everything.Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Fifteenth Chapter, ofthe Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Lord Kåñëa's Description of Mystic Yoga Perfections."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">16. The Lord's Opulence</div>
<div class="First">In this chapter the Personality of Godhead, Lord Çré Kåñëa, describes Hismanifest opulences in terms of His specific potencies of knowledge, strength, influence, and so on.</div>
<div class="First">Çré Uddhava offered glorification to Lord Çré Kåñëa, the SupremePersonality of Godhead and ultimate shelter of all holy places, saying, "TheSupreme Lord has no beginning and no end. He is the cause of the birth,maintenance and destruction of all living entities. He is the soul of all beings,and by secretly taking up residence within all living bodies He sees everything.The conditioned souls, on the other hand, are bewildered by His externalenergy and thus are unable to see Him." After offering such prayers at thelotus feet of Lord Kåñëa, Çré Uddhava revealed his desire to know about theLord's various opulences in heaven, on earth, in hell and in all directions. LordÇré Kåñëa then described all these opulences, after which He commented thatall power, beauty, fame, opulence, humility, charity, charm, good fortune,valor, tolerance and wisdom-wherever they are manifest-are simply expansionsfrom Himself. It therefore cannot be truthfully said that a material objectactually possesses these opulences. Such conceptions are the results of mentallycombining two ideas to produce an object that exists only in the imagination,such as a sky flower. Material opulences are not substantially true, andtherefore one should not become too involved in meditating upon them. Thepure devotees of the Supreme Lord utilize their intelligence to properlyregulate the activities of their speech, mind and vital force and thus perfect their existence in Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Brahma means the greatest of all and the cause of everything. Uddhavahere addresses the Lord as the paramam, or supreme brahma, because in Hisfeature as Bhagavän the Lord is the highest feature of the Absolute Truth andthe shelter of unlimited spiritual opulences. Unlike those of ordinary livingentities, the Lord's opulences cannot be restricted by time, and thus the Lord isanädy-antam, without beginning or end, and apävåtam, unhindered by anysuperior or equal potency. The opulence of the material world is also restingwithin the Lord, who alone can protect, maintain, create and destroy thematerial world. In this chapter, Çré Uddhava inquires from the Lord about Hisspiritual and material opulences in order to refine his appreciation of theLord's position as the Absolute Truth. Even Lord Viñëu, the ultimate creatorof the material world, is an expansion of Lord Kåñëa, and thus Çré Uddhavawishes to fully appreciate the unique status of his personal friend.</div>

The saintly brähmaëas, or Vaiñëavas,worship Lord Kåñëa within all things and yet recognize the variety in theLord's creation. For example, in worshiping the Deity, the devotees will selectthe nicest flowers, fruits and ornaments for decorating the transcendentalform of the Lord. Similarly, although the Lord is present in the heart of everyconditioned soul, the devotee will give more attention to a conditioned soulinterested in the message of Lord Kåñëa. Although the Lord is everywhere, thedevotees make distinctions, for the sake of the Lord's service, between Hispresence in superior (ucca) and inferior (avaceñu) creations.</div>

<div class="First">Çréla Çrédhara Svämé points out that the Personality of Godhead maintainsan ablative and genitive relationship with His opulences. In other words, theLord is not different from all living entities, because they are coming fromHim and they belong to Him. The Lord gave a similar explanation to Arjunain the Tenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä (10.20), beginning with the samewords, aham ätmä. Although the Lord describes His external, or material,opulences, the Lord's position is always transcendental and nonmaterial. Justas the living soul within the body gives life to the body, similarly, the Lord, byHis supreme potency, gives life to all universal opulences.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Any science is based on the faculty of expert discrimination. By skillfuldefinition of isolated and interactive components one becomes expert in anyfield. Ultimately the most intelligent person can isolate the spirit soul frommatter and describe the properties of matter and spirit as both isolated andinteractive components of reality. The proliferation of innumerablephilosophical speculations is due to differing modes of perception within thematerial world. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (15.15), sarvasya cähaà hådisanniviñöo mattaù småtir jïänam apohanaà ca: the Supreme Personality ofGodhead is situated in everyone's heart and awards a particular degree ofknowledge or ignorance according to one's desire and merit. Thus the LordHimself is the basis of the mundane process of philosophical speculation, forHe creates differing and alternating modes of perception within theconditioned souls. It is to be understood that one can acquire perfectknowledge only by hearing directly from Lord Kåñëa and not by hearing fromconditioned philosophers who imperfectly perceive the creation of the Lord through the screen of their personal desires.</div>

<div class="First">The Vedic literatures state that one who possesses perfect knowledge of thecreation and destruction of all entities and who is completely situated inomniscience is to be known as the Supreme Personality of Godhead,Bhagavän. Although many great personalities are sometimes called Bhagavän,ultimately Bhagavän is the one supreme entity who possesses unlimitedopulences. Throughout history, many important personalities have beenaddressed as "lord," but ultimately there is only one Supreme Lord. In theLord's catur-vyüha, or quadruple expansion, the first manifestation isVäsudeva, who here represents all of the Lord's expansions in the viñëu-tattva category.</div>

Nothingcan possibly exist even for a moment without the mercy of the Supreme Lord.One should not foolishly conclude that the Lord is therefore material. As hasbeen clearly explained in this canto of the Bhägavatam, both the living entityand the Supreme Lord are completely transcendental to material nature. Theliving entity, however, has the propensity to dream that he is material, whereasthe Lord constantly remembers the transcendental position of both Himselfand the conditioned dreaming entity. As the Lord is transcendental, His abodeis also far beyond the reach of the modes of nature. The actual purpose of lifeis to understand by mature conviction the transcendental Lord, Histranscendental abode, our own transcendental position and the process by which we may go back home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation"> I have briefly described to you all My spiritual opulences and also the extraordinary material features of My creation, which are perceived by the mind and defined in different ways according to circumstances.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to Sanskrit grammar, and as confirmed by Çréla Çrédhara Svämé,the words etäù and ete describe two distinct sets of the Lord's opulences. TheLord has described His opulent plenary expansions, such as Väsudeva,Näräyaëa, the Supersoul, etc., and further the Lord has described theoutstanding features of the material creation, which are also included amongthe glories of the Personality of Godhead. The plenary manifestations of theLord, such as Väsudeva, Näräyaëa, etc., are all eternal, unchangingtranscendental features of the Lord and are indicated by the term etäù. Theextraordinary aspects of material creation, however, are circumstantial anddependent on individual perception, and they are therefore described here bythe words mano-vikärä evaite yathä väcäbhidhéyate. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explainsthat by consistent logical application of synonyms, etäù refers to the Lord'seternal spiritual manifestations, beyond the perception of the material senses,whereas ete refers to those opulences that can be perceived by conditionedsouls. He gives the example that the paraphernalia and intimate associates of aking are all considered to be part and parcel of the king and are thereforegranted royal status. Similarly, the opulent features of material creation arereflected expansions of the Lord's personal opulences and thus may beconsidered nondifferent from Him. One should not, however, wrongly assumethat such insignificant material opulences occupy the same status as the Lord'splenary features as the Personality of Godhead, which are qualitatively and quantitatively equal to the Lord.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura comments as follows on this verse."The Lord's external opulences are called mano-vikäräù, or 'related to mentaltransformation,' because ordinary people perceive extraordinary features of thematerial world according to their personal state of mind. Thus the wordväcäbhidhéyate indicates that conditioned souls describe the Lord's materialcreation according to specific material circumstances. Because of thecircumstantial relative definitions of material opulence, such opulence is neverto be considered a direct plenary manifestation of the Lord's personal form.When one's state of mind is transformed into a favorable or affectionate state,one defines a manifestation of the Lord's energy as 'my son,' 'my father,' 'myhusband,' 'my uncle,' 'the son of my brother,' 'my friend,' and so on. One forgetsthat every living entity is actually part and parcel of the Supreme Personalityof Godhead and that whatever opulences, talents or outstanding features onemay exhibit are actually the potencies of the Lord. Similarly, when the mind istransformed into a negative or inimical state, one thinks, 'This person will bethe ruin of me,' 'This person must be finished by me,' 'He is my enemy' or 'I amhis enemy,' 'He is a killer, or 'He should be killed.' The negative state of mind isalso expressed when one is attracted to the extraordinary material aspects ofparticular persons or objects but forgets that they are manifestations of thepotency of the Personality of Godhead. Even the demigod Indra, who is quiteobviously a manifestation of the Lord's material opulences, is misunderstood byothers. For example, Indra's wife, Çacé, thinks that Indra is 'my husband,'whereas Aditi thinks that he is 'my son.' Jayanta thinks that he is 'my father,'Båhaspati thinks that he is 'my disciple,' whereas the demons feel that Indra istheir personal enemy. Thus different personalities define him according totheir mental state. The Lord's material opulences, being relatively perceived,are therefore called mano-vikära, which means they are dependent on mentalstates. This relative perception is material because it does not recognize theSupreme Personality of Godhead as the actual source of the particularopulence. If one sees Lord Kåñëa as the source of all opulences and gives up alldesires to enjoy or possess the Lord's opulences, then one can see the spiritualnature of these opulences. At that time, even though one may continue toperceive the variety and distinctions of the material world, one will becomeperfect in Kåñëa consciousness. One should not conclude, as do the voidistphilosophers, that the Lord's spiritual manifestations in the viñëu-tattva andliberated jéva categories are also products of relative perception and mentalstates. This useless idea is contrary to the entire body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's teachings to Çré Uddhava."</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the word väcä also indicates the variousVedic literatures that describe the particular processes by which the Lordmanifests His spiritual and material opulences, and in this context yathäindicates the specific procedures of manifestation and creation.</div>

Since everythingbelongs to the Lord, everything ultimately should be engaged in the Lord'sservice with great care. A self-realized devotee tolerates personal insult anddoes not become envious of any living entity, nor does he see anyone as hisenemy. This is practical enlightenment. Although a pure devotee may criticizethose who obstruct the Lord's mission, such criticism is never personallymotivated nor is it ever based on enviousness. An advanced devotee of theLord may chastise his followers or criticize the demoniac, but only to carry outthe mission of the Supreme Lord and never out of personal enmity orenviousness. For one who completely gives up the material concept of lifethere is no possibility of entering again onto the path of birth and death.</div>

Byclear intelligence, one becomes naturally and spontaneously disinterested inthe rewards offered by mental speculation and fruitive activities and takes full shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Chapnum">17. Lord Kåñëa's Description of the Varëäçrama System</div>
<div class="First">Previously, the Supreme Lord, Çré Kåñëa, had assumed the form of Haàsaand glorified the duties of the brahmacäré and gåhastha orders. In this presentchapter Lord Kåñëa further describes these matters to Uddhava.After Uddhava inquires from Çré Kåñëa about the duties of the social andreligious orders of the varëäçrama society, the Lord replies that in the first age,Satya-yuga, there was only one social order, called haàsa. In that age men wereautomatically dedicated to pure devotional service from their very birth, andsince everyone was perfect in-all respects, the age was called Kåta-yuga. TheVedas were then manifest in the form of the sacred syllable oà, and theSupreme Lord was perceived within the mind in the form of the four-leggedbull of religion. There were no formalized processes of sacrifice, and the sinlesspeople, who were naturally inclined to austerity, simply engaged in meditationon the personal form of the Lord. In the following age, Tretä-yuga, therebecame manifest from the heart of the Supreme Personality of Godhead thethree Vedas, and from them the three forms of the sacrificial fire. At that timethe system of four varëas and four äçramas, which prescribes material andspiritual duties for the different members of society, appeared from the bodilylimbs of the Lord. According to how the social divisions took birth from higherand lower features of the Lord's body, they became endowed with higher andlower qualities. After this description, Lord Kåñëa explains the natures ofpersons in each of the four varëas and of those who are outside the limits ofthe varëas. He also describes those qualities that pertain to humanity in general.</div>
<div class="First">Members of the higher orders are qualified to accept second birth. Afterreceiving the sacred thread initiation, they should go to live in the guru-kula,the home of the spiritual master. With a pacified mind, the student(brahmacäré) should absorb himself in study of the Vedas. He should keepmatted hair and is forbidden to wash his teeth, prepare a nice seat for himself,talk when bathing or evacuating, cut his hair and nails or at any time passsemen. He must regularly perform worship at the three junctures of the dayand must render devotional service to his spiritual master in a spirit free fromenvy. The brahmacäré must offer to the guru whatever food and other thingshe obtains by begging. He accepts for his maintenance whatever remnants ofthe Lord he is granted. He should render menial service to the spiritual masterby massaging his feet and worshiping him and should avoid all sensegratification and strictly maintain the vow of celibacy. With his mind, bodyand words, he should worship the Supreme Lord in the form of the Supersoulin the way prescribed for him. For brahmacärés, seeing or touching women, andconversations or sports in the company of women, are absolutely disallowed.Cleanliness and ritual purification by water should be observed by members ofall the spiritual orders of society. Everyone is also advised to always rememberthat the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Supreme Soul dwelling within the hearts of all.</div>
<div class="First">After studying all the different aspects of the Vedas, a brähmaëa who hasmaterial desires may take permission from his spiritual master and enter familylife. Otherwise, if he has no material desire, he may become a vänaprastha orsannyäsé. The proper order of succession should be followed in changing fromone spiritual order to the next. One who wishes to enter the household ordershould accept a wife who is of the same social class, who is not objectionable, and who is somewhat younger in age than he.</div>
<div class="First">The obligatory duties of the three classes who are twice-born-thebrähmaëas, kñatriyas and vaiçyas-are worship of the Lord, study of the Vedasand giving charity. The occupational duties of accepting charity, teachingothers and performing sacrifice for others are the privilege of the brähmaëasalone. If a brähmaëa considers that his consciousness is contaminated byengaging in these occupations, he may sustain his existence by collectinggrains from the fields. If he is disturbed by poverty, the brähmaëa may out ofnecessity accept the business of a kñatriya or vaiçya, but he should never takethe occupation of a çüdra. In a similar situation, a kñatriya may take theoccupation of a vaiçya, and a vaiçya that of a çüdra. But when the emergencyhas passed, it is not fitting to continue earning one's living by a loweroccupation. A brähmaëa who is properly fixed in his personal duty rejects allinsignificant material desires, always serves the Vaiñëavas and is under theprotection of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The householder shouldstudy the Vedas every day and maintain his wards with money honestly earnedby his own occupation. As far as possible, he should execute worship of theLord by ritual sacrifices. Remaining unattached to material life and fixed indevotion to the Supreme Lord, the householder may finally take the order ofvänaprastha, so that he can fully involve himself in the Lord's worship. If hehas a grown son, he may directly take the renounced order of sannyäsa. Butpersons who are excessively lusty after women, who have no properdiscrimination, and who are extremely attached to wealth and possessionsremain perpetually in anxiety over the welfare of their family members and aredoomed to take their next birth in a lower species of life.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa has already elaborately explained the process of jïäna-yoga,bhakti-yoga and añöäìga-yoga. Now Uddhava inquires how those inclinedtoward karma-yoga can achieve the perfection of life, Kåñëa consciousness. InBhagavad-gétä (4.13) Lord Kåñëa describes that He is personally the creator ofthe varëäçrama system. Cätur-varëyaà mayä såñöaà guëa-karma-vibhägaçaù.Therefore the ultimate goal of the varëäçrama system is to please the SupremePersonality of Godhead. In other words, one should become a devotee of theLord and learn the process of pure devotional service. The easiest method ofachieving pure devotional service is by the association of pure devotees of theLord. If one submissively and faithfully associates with pure devotees, one canimmediately achieve the perfection of life. A Kåñëa conscious person is notrequired to execute all the formalities of the varëäçrama system, because aKåñëa conscious person, absorbed in love of Godhead, automatically gives upall sense gratification and mental speculation. Those human beings who do notfollow the varëäçrama system are here referred to as dvi-padäm, or two-legged.In other words, one who does not follow the religious path of life is known tobe human only by the possession of two legs. Even ordinary animals andinsects are eagerly engaged in eating, sleeping, mating and defending; thehuman being, however, is distinguished from such lower forms of life by hiscapacity to become religious and, ultimately, to love God in pure Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

In the modern agepeople are crying out for social equality, but unless all human beings aresituated in the mode of goodness, which is the position of purity and unalloyeddevotion, social equality is not possible. As the lower modes of nature becomeprominent, secondary religious principles arise, by which people may begradually elevated to the pure stage of unalloyed surrender to God. InSatya-yuga there are no inferior human beings, and thus there is no need ofsecondary religious principles. Everyone directly takes to the unalloyed serviceof the Lord, fulfilling perfectly all religious obligations. In Sanskrit, one whoperfectly executes all duties is called kåta-kåtya, as mentioned in this verse.Therefore Satya-yuga is called Kåta-yuga, or the age of perfect religious action.According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the word ädau ("in the beginning") refers tothe moment of universal creation. In other words, the varëäçrama system isnot a recent concoction but naturally arises at the time of creation and shouldtherefore be accepted by all intelligent human beings.</div>

In Europe and America, we have practically observed thatthe standards of cleanliness are abominable even among so-called educatedpersons. Going without bathing and the use of indecent language are common.In the modern age people whimsically speak whatever they like, dispensingwith all authority, and there is therefore very little truthfulness or truewisdom. Similarly, in both the capitalistic and communistic countries,everyone is busily engaged in stealing and robbing from everyone else in thename of business, taxation or outright crime. People are not confident of thekingdom of God nor of their own eternal nature, and thus their faith is veryweak. Moreover, since modern human beings are not very interested in Kåñëaconsciousness they constantly quarrel, bicker and fight over completelyinsignificant issues relating to the material body. Thus at the slightestprovocation there are huge wars and massacres. Lust, anger and hankeringhave become practically unlimited in Kali-yuga. The symptoms andcharacteristics mentioned here can be abundantly observed throughout theworld, wherever people have fallen away from the varëäçrama system. Becauseof sinful habits such as animal killing, illicit sex, intoxication and gambling,the great majority of human beings have become caëòälas, or untouchables.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The term dvija, or "twice-born," here indicates the three superior classes,namely brähmaëas, kñatriyas and vaiçyas, who all receive the Gäyatré mantra,which signifies their second birth through spiritual initiation. One's first birthis biological, or seminal, and does not necessarily indicate that one isintelligent or enlightened. A young brähmaëa boy, if qualified, may beinitiated with Gäyatré mantra at the age of twelve, and kñatriyas and vaiçyas afew years later. In order to become enlightened with spiritual knowledge, theboy resides within the guru-kula, or äçrama of the spiritual master. TheInternational Society for Krishna Consciousness has established similarguru-kulas all over the world and is issuing a great call to civilized humanbeings to arrange for the proper education of their children. Every young boyand girl should learn to be self-controlled and should become enlightenedthrough study of authorized Vedic literatures. In this way, unlike ordinaryanimals, insects, fish and birds, etc., an enlightened human being may takebirth twice and thus become perfect in the knowledge that leads to ultimateliberation. The word änupürvyät in this verse indicates the system ofsaàskäras, or purificatory rites, beginning with garbhädhäna-saàskära, or thepurification of the sexual act. Generally, çüdras and those who do not followthe Vedic system are not attracted to such purificatory ceremonies; thereforethey remain ignorant of spiritual life and envious of the bona fide spiritualmaster. Those whose character has been civilized by a systematic cleansingprocess give up the tendency to be argumentative and whimsical and insteadbecome submissive and eager to learn in the presence of a bona fide spiritual master.</div>

<div class="First">This verse appears in Caitanya-caritämåta (Ädi 1.46). His Divine Grace OàViñëupäda Paramahaàsa Parivräjakäcärya Añöottara-çata Çré Çrémad A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda has commented on this verse as follows."This is a verse from Çrémad-Bhägavatam (11.17.27) spoken by Lord ÇréKåñëa when He was questioned by Uddhava regarding the four social andspiritual orders of society. He was specifically instructing how a brahmacäréshould behave under the care of a spiritual master. A spiritual master is not anenjoyer of facilities offered by his disciples. He is like a parent. Without theattentive service of his parents, a child cannot grow to manhood; similarly,without the care of the spiritual master one cannot rise to the plane of transcendental service.</div>
<div class="First">"The spiritual master is also called äcärya, or a transcendental professor ofspiritual science. Manu-saàhitä (2.140) explains the duties of an äcärya,describing that a bona fide spiritual maser accepts charge of disciples, teachesthem the Vedic knowledge with all its intricacies, and gives them their secondbirth. The ceremony performed to initiate a disciple into the study of spiritualscience is called upanéti, or the function that brings one nearer to the spiritualmaster. One who cannot be brought nearer to a spiritual master cannot have asacred thread, and thus he is indicated to be a çüdra. The sacred thread wornon the body of a brähmaëa, kñatriya or vaiçya is a symbol of initiation by thespiritual master; it is worth nothing if worn merely to boast of high parentage.The duty of the spiritual master is to initiate a disciple with the sacred threadceremony, and after this saàskära, or purificatory process, the spiritual masteractually begins to teach the disciple about the Vedas. A person born a çüdra isnot barred from such spiritual initiation, provided he is approved by thespiritual master, who is duly authorized to award a disciple the right to be abrähmaëa if he finds him perfectly qualified. In the Väyu Puräëa an äcärya isdefined as one who knows the import of all the Vedic literatures, abides bytheir rules and regulations, and teaches his disciples to act in the same way."Only out of His immense compassion does the Personality of Godheadreveal Himself as the spiritual master. Therefore in the dealings of an äcäryathere are no activities but those of transcendental loving service to the Lord.He is the Supreme Personality of Servitor Godhead. It is worthwhile to takeshelter of such a steady devotee, who is called äçraya-vigraha, or themanifestation or form of the Lord of whom one must take shelter."If one poses himself as an äcärya but does not have an attitude ofservitorship to the Lord, he must be considered an offender, and this offensiveattitude disqualifies him from being an äcärya. The bona fide spiritual masteralways engages in unalloyed devotional service to the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. By this test he is known to be a direct manifestation of the Lord anda genuine representative of Çré Nityänanda Prabhu. Such a spiritual master isknown as äcäryadeva. Influenced by an envious temperament and dissatisfiedbecause of an attitude of sense gratification, mundaners criticize a real äcärya.In fact, however, a bona fide äcärya is nondifferent from the Personality ofGodhead, and therefore to envy such an äcärya is to envy the Personality ofGodhead Himself. This will produce an effect subversive to transcendental realization.</div>
<div class="First">"As mentioned previously, a disciple should always respect the spiritualmaster as a manifestation of Çré Kåñëa, but at the same time one should alwaysremember that a spiritual master is never authorized to imitate thetranscendental pastimes of the Lord. False spiritual masters pose themselves asidentical with Çré Kåñëa in every respect, to exploit the sentiments of theirdisciples, but such impersonalists can only mislead their disciples, for theirultimate aim is to become one with the Lord. This is against the principles of the devotional cult.</div>
<div class="First">"The real Vedic philosophy is acintya-bhedäbheda-tattva, which establisheseverything to be simultaneously one with and different from the Personality ofGodhead. Çréla Raghunätha däsa Gosvämé confirms that this is the realposition of a bona fide spiritual master and says that one should always thinkof the spiritual master in terms of his intimate relationship with Mukunda (ÇréKåñëa). Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, in his Bhakti-sandarbha (213), has clearly definedthat a pure devotee's observation of the spiritual master and Lord Çiva as onewith the Personality of Godhead exists in terms of their being very dear to theLord, not identical with Him in all respects. Following in the footsteps of ÇrélaRaghunätha däsa Gosvämé and Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, later äcäryas like ÇrélaViçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura have confirmed the same truths. In hisprayers to the spiritual master, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura confirmsthat all the revealed scriptures accept the spiritual master to be identical withthe Personality of Godhead because he is a very dear and confidential servantof the Lord. Gauòéya Vaiñëavas therefore worship Çréla Gurudeva (thespiritual master) in the light of his being the servitor of the Personality ofGodhead. In all the ancient literatures of devotional service and in the morerecent songs of Çréla Narottama däsa Öhäkura, Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkuraand other unalloyed Vaiñëavas, the spiritual master is always considered to beeither one of the confidential associates of Çrématé Rädhäräëé or a manifested representation of Çréla Nityänanda Prabhu."</div>

<div class="First">One who desires to receive the mercy of a bona fide spiritual master shouldnot be eager to accumulate the paraphernalia of sense gratification; rather,whatever one is able to collect one should offer at the lotus feet of the äcärya.Being self-controlled, one should humbly accept that which is allotted by thebona fide spiritual master. Every living entity must ultimately be trained toserve the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but until one has become expert inthe techniques of spiritual service one should offer everything to the spiritualmaster, who is completely realized in the process of worshiping the Lord.When the spiritual master sees that the disciple is advanced in Kåñëaconsciousness, he then engages the disciple in directly worshiping thePersonality of Godhead. A bona fide spiritual master does not use anything forhis personal sense gratification and entrusts to his disciple only as muchmaterial opulence as the disciple can properly offer to the lotus feet of theLord. The example may be given that when an ordinary father tries to train hisson in business and other material activities, he entrusts to the son only asmuch wealth as the son can intelligently engage in profitable enterpriseswithout foolishly wasting the father's hard-earned money.Similarly, the bona fide spiritual master teaches his disciple to worship theLord, and an immature disciple must simply deliver everything to the lotus feetof the guru, just as an immature child does not keep a personal bank accountbut rather receives his maintenance from the father, who trains the son to beresponsible. If one cheats oneself by defying the order of a bona fide spiritualmaster or Kåñëa, one certainly becomes a nondevotee, or sense enjoyer, andfalls from the spiritual path. Therefore, one should be trained to serve a bonafide spiritual master and thus become mature in Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="First">The process of liberation is described in this verse. Once when ÇrélaPrabhupäda was traveling by airplane, a fellow passenger, who happened to bea priest, told him that he had seen his disciples and found them "bright-faced."Çréla Prabhupäda was fond of relating this incident. The spirit soul is morebrilliant than the sun, and as the process of spiritual purification graduallytakes effect, even the external form of a devotee becomes effulgent. Theglowing fire of spiritual knowledge burns to ashes the mentality of sensegratification, and one naturally becomes austere and disinterested in mundaneenjoyment. Among all austerities, the best is celibacy, by which the shackles ofmaterial life immediately become slackened. One who is amala, free frommaterial desire, is known as a pure devotee of the Lord. On the paths of jïäna,karma and yoga the mind retains the concept of personal interest, but on thepath of pure devotion the mind is trained to see only the interests of thePersonality of Godhead. Thus a pure devotee of the Lord is amala, completely pure.</div>

<div class="First">This verse describes the process called samävartana, or returning to one'shome after finishing Vedic education in the äçrama of the spiritual master.One who cannot concentrate all of his desires in the devotional service of theLord is attracted to householder life, and if this attraction is not regulated, onewill fall down. Being covered by the ignorance of fruitive activities and mentalspeculation, a living entity seeks enjoyment outside the devotional service ofthe Supreme Lord and becomes a nondevotee. One who takes to family lifemust rigidly follow the Vedic rules and regulations in order to avoid thecollapse of his spiritual determination. One who enjoys intimate sensegratification with women must become duplicitous in his dealings with othersand consequently falls down from the platform of simple, pure life. When themind is disturbed by lust, one begins to resent the principle of submission tothe Supreme Personality of Godhead and His pure devotee, and the darkclouds of one's offensive mentality completely cover the light of spiritualknowledge. One should dovetail his propensity to love someone by serving thelotus feet of a pure devotee. As stated in Vedic literature, "One who worshipsGovinda, Lord Kåñëa, but does not worship His devotees is not to beconsidered an advanced Vaiñëava; rather, he is to be considered a proud hypocrite."</div>

<div class="Translation"> A brahmacäré desiring to fulfill his material desires should live at home with his family, and a householder who is eager to purify his consciousness should enter the forest, whereas a purified brähmaëa should accept the renounced order of life. One who is not surrendered to Me should move progressively from one äçrama to another, never acting otherwise.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Those who are not surrendered devotees of the Lord must rigidly observethe regulations governing one's authorized social status. There are four socialdivisions of life, namely brahmacarya, gåhastha, vänaprastha and sannyäsa. Onewho wants to fulfill material desires should become an ordinary householder(gåhastha), establish a comfortable residence and maintain his family. Onedesiring to accelerate the process of purification may give up his home andbusiness and live in a sacred place with his wife, as indicated here by the wordvanam, or "forest." There are many sacred forests in India meant for thispurpose, such as Våndävana and Mäyäpur. The word dvijottama indicates thebrähmaëas. Brähmaëas, kñatriyas and vaiçyas are all dvija, or initiated in theGäyatré mantra, but the brähmaëa is dvijottama, or the highest among thosewho have received second birth by spiritual initiation. It is recommended thata purified brähmaëa take to the renounced order of life (sannyäsa), giving upfurther contact with his so-called wife. The brähmaëa is specifically mentionedhere, since kñatriyas and vaiçyas are not to take the renounced order of life.Even so, there are many stories in the Bhägavatam wherein great kings retirewith their aristocratic wives to the forest to practice the austerities ofvänaprastha and thus accelerate the process of purification. The brähmaëas,however, may directly accept the renounced order of life.The words äçramäd äçramaà gacchet indicate that one may progressivelymove from brahmacäré life to gåhastha life to vänaprastha life and then tosannyäsa. The words äçramäd äçramam emphasize that one should neverremain without an authorized social status, nor should one go backward, fallingdown from a higher position. Those who are not surrendered devotees of theLord must rigidly observe such injunctions, for otherwise they will quicklybecome degraded, and their sins will place them outside the bounds of authorized human civilization.</div>
<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa emphasizes here that a nondevotee must rigidly observe therituals and regulations of Vedic social divisions, whereas the Lord's puredevotee, engaged twenty-four hours a day in Lord Kåñëa's mission, istranscendental to such divisions. If, however, one performs illicit activities onthe strength of being transcendental to Vedic social divisions, one is revealedto be a materialistic neophyte and not an advanced devotee of the Lord. Anadvanced devotee, who remains aloof from material sense gratification, is notbound by the Vedic social divisions; thus even a householder may live veryausterely, traveling and preaching Kåñëa consciousness away from home, andeven a sannyäsé may sometimes engage women in the devotional service ofLord Kåñëa. The most advanced devotees cannot be restricted by the ritualsand regulations of the varëäçrama system, and they move freely around theworld distributing love of Godhead. Mat-para indicates a pure devotee of theLord who always keeps the Lord fixed in his heart and consciousness. One whofalls down to become a victim of sense gratification is not fully established onthe platform of mat-para and should rigidly observe the social divisions andregulations to remain steady on the platform of pious human life.</div>

The wife must be beyondreproach in terms of her background and character and should always beyounger than oneself, ideally five to ten years younger. If one desires to marrya second wife, then, as stated in this verse by the word varëänupürvyeëa and inthe verse spoken by Lord Kåñëa by the word anukramät, one must wait untilthe first marriage is established and then select a second wife from thenext-lower caste. If one marries a third time the wife must be, again, from thenext-lower caste. For example, a brähmaëa's first wife will be a brähmaëé, hissecond wife will be from the kñatriya community, his third wife from the vaiçyacommunity and fourth wife from the çüdra community. A kñatriya may firstmarry a kñatriya lady and then vaiçya and çüdra ladies. A vaiçya can acceptwives from two classes, and a çüdra will accept a wife only from the çüdra class.By this progression of marriages there will be relative peace in the family.These Vedic marriage injunctions, as mentioned in the previous verse, areespecially for those who are not pure devotees of the Lord.</div>

<div class="First">"But those who worship Me with devotion, meditating on My transcendentalform—to them I carry what they lack and preserve what they have."A brähmaëa should not become a professional beggar for his personalmaintenance. In India there are many so-called brähmaëas who sit at the gatesof important temples and beg from everyone who comes and goes. If someonedoes not give a donation they become angry and chase that person. Similarly,in America there are many big preachers who collect huge amounts of moneyby begging on television and radio. If a brähmaëa or Vaiñëava considers thatbeing a professional beggar is weakening his austerity, destroying his spiritualinfluence and giving him a bad reputation, then he should give up thatprocess. One may beg everyone to contribute to the cause of the SupremePersonality of Godhead, but one will be diminished in austerity, influence andreputation by begging for one's personal livelihood. A brähmaëa may then takeup the task of teaching Vedic knowledge and performing sacrifice. But evensuch occupations do not bring one to the highest platform of trust in God. Abrähmaëa who teaches as a means of livelihood may often be curbed in histeaching, and one who performs sacrifice may be manipulated by materialisticworshipers. In this way, a brähmaëa may be placed in an embarrassing andcompromised position. Therefore a high-class brähmaëa or Vaiñëava ultimatelywill depend completely on the mercy of the Lord for his maintenance. TheLord promises to maintain His devotee, and an advanced Vaiñëava never doubts the word of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">One may ask why a brähmaëa should voluntarily accept inconvenience inkeeping his body and soul together. In this verse the Lord explains thatadvanced human life is meant for serious austerity and not for insignificantsense gratification. By spiritual advancement one is fixed in transcendentalbliss on the spiritual platform and gives up useless absorption in the temporarymaterial body. One should remain detached from the material body, acceptingonly the bare necessities of life. The brähmaëas, by accepting a troublesomeform of livelihood, never forget that the material body is destined to grow old,become diseased and die in misery. Thus remaining alert and transcendental,an advanced brähmaëa, at the end of this life, goes back home, back toGodhead, where he enjoys unlimited spiritual bliss. Without such higherawareness, how can one be considered a qualified brähmaëa?Those devotees engaged twenty-four hours a day in spreading the mission ofLord Kåñëa are beyond the platform of renunciation or sense gratificationbecause they engage everything in Lord Kåñëa's service. A pure devotee of theLord eats only to get strength for serving the Lord and does not accept eithersumptuous or meager food simply for the body's sake. However, everything maybe accepted for the Lord, even sumptuous meals. A brähmaëa who is notworking day and night to spread the glories of the Lord should feelembarrassed to eat sumptuously for his personal sense gratification, but arenounced Vaiñëava preacher may accept invitations from all classes of piouspeople, and just to bless their homes he will eat the opulent foods they offer tohim. Similarly, he sometimes eats sumptuously to get strength for defeatingatheists and impersonalists. As stated in Vedic literature, one cannot be ahighly qualified brähmaëa unless one becomes a devotee of the Lord. Andamong the devotees, those who are preaching Kåñëa consciousness are the best,as confirmed by the Lord Himself in the Eighteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä.</div>

<div class="First">The Lord has described how brähmaëas and devotees achieve theperfection of life, and now a similar perfection is offered to those who utilizetheir materialistic wealth to relieve the poverty-stricken condition of devoteesand brähmaëas. Although one may neglect the devotional service of the Lordto pursue a material life of sense gratification, one can rectify one's position bydedicating one's hard-earned money to the service of the Lord. Seeing thedifficult austerities accepted by saintly persons, a pious person should makearrangements for their comfort. Just as a boat saves hopeless people who havefallen into the ocean, similarly, the Lord uplifts persons who have hopelesslyfallen into the ocean of material attachment if they have been charitable to the brähmaëas and devotees.</div>

<div class="First">Päntha-saìgama indicates the momentary association of travelers at hotels,restaurants, tourist spots or, in more traditional cultures, freshwater wells andwalking paths. We are now associated with many relatives, friends andwell-wishers, but as soon as we change our material body we will immediatelybe separated from all these associates, just as upon awakening we areimmediately separated from the imaginary situation of a dream. One becomesattached to the sense gratification of one's dream, and similarly, under thespell of the illusory concepts of "I" and "mine," we become attached to so-calledrelatives and friends who gratify our sense of false ego. Unfortunately, suchfleeting egoistic association covers our real knowledge of the self and theSupreme, and we remain hovering in material illusion, futilely endeavoring forpermanent sense gratification. One who remains attached to the bodilyconcept of family and friends cannot possibly give up the false egoism of "I"and "mine," or "I am everything and everything is mine."Without giving up material sense gratification we cannot become steady onthe transcendental platform of devotional service, and therefore we cannotrelish the actual flavor of eternal happiness. Unless one becomes a puredevotee of the Lord, accepting Lord Kåñëa as one's only friend, one cannotgive up the hankering for temporary and superficial material relationships. Atraveler far away from his home and loved ones may strike up superficialconversations with other travelers, but such relationships have no ultimatemeaning. One should therefore revive one's lost relationship with Lord Kåñëa.We are constitutionally part and parcel of Lord Kåñëa, who is the reservoir ofall spiritual pleasure, and our original relationship with Him is full of love andhappiness. But because of our desire to enjoy independently from Him, we falldown into the confusing, meaningless network of material relationshipscreated by mäyä. An intelligent person realizes there is no actual pleasure orsatisfaction for the soul on either this planet or any other material planet.Therefore, like a weary traveler exhausted from his journey, he should go backhome, back to Godhead, for eternal peace as the faithful servant of Lord Çré Kåñëa.</div>

<div class="First">Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Seventeenth Chapter, ofthe Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Lord Kåñëa's Description of the Varëäçrama System."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">18. Description of Varëäçrama-dharma</div>
<div class="First">As related in this chapter, Lord Çré Kåñëa explained to Uddhava the dutiesof the vänaprastha and sannyäsa orders and the religious practices proper to each of these levels of advancement.</div>
<div class="First">One who is taking to the vänaprastha stage of life should leave his wife athome in the care of his sons, or else take her along, and with a peaceful mindspend the third quarter of his life in the forest. He should accept as his foodwhatever bulbs, fruits, roots and so on that grow in the forest, takingsometimes grains cooked by fire and sometimes fruits ripened by time.Furthermore, he should take as his garments tree bark, grass, leaves or the skinof a deer. It is prescribed that he should perform austerities by not cutting hishair, beard, or nails. Nor should he make any special attempt to remove dirtfrom his limbs. He should bathe three times daily in cold water and sleep uponthe ground. During the hot season he should stand beneath the fearsome heatof the sun with fires blazing on four sides. During the rainy season he shouldstand in the midst of the downpour of rain, and during the cold winter heshould submerge himself in water up to his neck. He is absolutely forbidden toclean his teeth, to store food that he has collected at one time to eat at anothertime, and to worship the Supreme Lord with the flesh of animals. If he canmaintain those severe practices for the remainder of his life, the vänaprastha will achieve the Tapoloka planet.</div>
<div class="First">The fourth quarter of life is meant for sannyäsa. One should developcomplete detachment from attaining residence on different planets, up to evenBrahmaloka. Such wishes for material elevation are due to desire for the fruitsof material activity. When one recognizes that endeavors to achieve residenceon the higher planets ultimately award only suffering, then it is enjoined thatone should take to sannyäsa in a spirit of renunciation. The process ofaccepting sannyäsa involves worshiping the Lord with sacrifice, givingeverything one possesses in charity to the priests and establishing within one'sown heart the various sacrificial fires. For a sannyäsé, association with womenor even the sight of women is more undesirable than taking poison. Except inemergencies, the sannyäsé should never wear more clothing than a loincloth orsome simple covering over his loincloth. He should carry no more than hisstaff and waterpot. Giving up all violence to living creatures, he shouldbecome subdued in the functions of his body, mind and speech. He shouldremain detached and fixed on the self and travel alone to such pure places asthe mountains, rivers and forests. Thus engaged, he should remember theSupreme Personality of Godhead and dwell in a place that is fearless and notheavily populated. He should take his alms each day at seven homes chosen atrandom from those of the members of the four social classes, avoiding only thehomes of those who are cursed or fallen. With a pure heart he should offer tothe Supreme Personality of Godhead whatever food he has collected and takethe mahä-prasädam remnants. In this way he should always be mindful thathankering for sense gratification is bondage and that engaging the objects ofthe senses in the service of Lord Mädhava is liberation. If one lacks knowledgeand renunciation, or continues to be troubled by the unconquered six enemiesheaded by lust and the all-powerful senses, or if one accepts the tri-daëòarenounced order simply for the purpose of carrying out a livelihood, then hewill achieve as his result only the killing of his own soul.A paramahaàsa is not under the control of injunctions and prohibitions.He is a devotee of the Supreme Lord, detached from external sensegratification and completely free from desire for even such subtle gratificatorygoals as liberation. He is expert in discrimination and, just like a simple child,is free from concepts of pride and insult. Although actually competent, hewanders about like a dull person, and although most learned, he engageshimself like an insane fool in incoherent speech. Although actually fixed inthe Vedas, he behaves in an unordered fashion. He tolerates the evil words ofothers and never shows contempt for anyone else. He avoids acting as anenemy or vainly indulging in argument. He sees the Supreme Personality ofGodhead in all creatures and also all living beings within the SupremePersonality of Godhead. In order to keep his body alive for performing worshipof the Lord, he accepts whatever excellent or inferior food, clothing andbedding he can obtain without endeavor. Although he has to make some effortto find food for maintaining his body, he does not become joyful when he findssomething, nor does he become depressed when not finding anything. TheSupreme Lord Himself, although not at all subject to the Vedic orders andprohibitions, by His own free will executes various prescribed duties; similarlythe paramahaàsa, even while on the platform of freedom from subjugation toVedic rules and prohibitions, carries out various duties. Because his perceptionof dualities has become completely eradicated by transcendental knowledge,which is focused on the Supreme Lord, he obtains upon the demise of hismaterial body the liberation known as särñöi, in which one becomes equal in opulence with the Lord.</div>
<div class="First">The person who desires his own best interest should take shelter of a bonafide spiritual master. Filling his mind with faith, keeping free from enviousnessand remaining fixed in devotion, the disciple should serve the spiritual master,whom he should regard as nondifferent from the Supreme Lord. For abrahmacäré, the primary duty is service to the spiritual master. The main dutiesfor a householder are protection of living beings and sacrifice, for avänaprastha austerities, and for a sannyäsé self-control and nonviolence.Celibacy (practiced by householders at all times except once a month whenthe wife is fertile), penance, cleanliness, self-satisfaction, friendship with allliving beings and above all worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead areduties meant for every jéva soul. One acquires firm devotion for the SupremeLord by always rendering service to the Supreme Personality of Godheadthrough one's own particular prescribed duty, by not engaging in the worshipof any other personalities, and also by thinking of all creatures as the place ofresidence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form as the Supersoul.The followers of the karma-käëòa section of the Vedas can attain the planetsof the forefathers and so on by their ritualistic activities, but if they becomeendowed with devotion for the Supreme Lord, then by these same activities they can achieve the supreme stage of liberation.</div>

A pure devotee eats, dresses and speaks only for the service ofthe Lord, and thus whatever assistance he accepts from others is not forhimself.

<div class="Translation"> One who has not accepted the three internal disciplines of avoiding useless speech, avoiding useless activities and controlling the life air can never be considered a sannyäsé merely because of his carrying bamboo rods.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The word daëòa indicates the staff carried by those in the renounced orderof life, and daëòa also indicates severe discipline. The Vaiñëava sannyäsésaccept a staff made of three bamboo rods, signifying dedication of the body,mind and words to the service of the Supreme Lord. Here Lord Kåñëa says thatone must first accept these three daëòas, or disciplines (namely control of thevoice, body and mind), within oneself. The practice of aniläyäma (orpräëäyäma, regulating the life air) is meant to control the mind, and one whoalways thinks of service to Lord Kåñëa has certainly achieved the perfection ofpräëäyäma. Merely carrying the three external daëòas without assimilating theinternal daëòas of bodily, mental and vocal discipline can never make one anactual Vaiñëava sannyäsé, as explained here by Lord Kåñëa.In the Haàsa-gétä section of Mahäbhärata and in Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé'sUpadeçämåta, there are instructions regarding the sannyäsa order of life. Aconditioned soul who adopts only the external ornaments of tridaëòé-sannyäsawill not actually be able to control the senses. One who takes sannyäsa for falseprestige, making a show of saintliness without actual advancement inkåñëa-kértana, will soon be vanquished by the external energy of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Rejecting those houses that are polluted and untouchable, one should approach without previous calculation seven houses and be satisfied with that which is obtained there by begging. According to necessity, one may approach each of the four occupational orders of society.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Saintly persons in the renounced order of life may beg from strict followersof Vedic culture to obtain foodstuffs and other bodily necessities. According toVedic injunction, a renounced saint should beg from the brähmaëacommunity, but if there is danger of his starving, he may beg from kñatriyas,then vaiçyas, and even çüdras if they are not sinful, as expressed here by theword vigarhyän. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura explains thatasaìkÿptän indicates that one should not approach certain houses, calculating,"In that place I can get first-class food. That house has a big reputation amongbeggars." Without discriminating, one should go to seven houses and besatisfied with whatever may be obtained there. One should beg for one'spersonal maintenance only from houses where the inhabitants, being sincerefollowers of the varëäçrama culture, have earned their livelihood by honestmeans and are free from sinful activities. One may beg alms from suchhouseholders. One must not beg alms for one's personal maintenance fromthose who oppose the Supreme Lord's devotional service, for such service is the whole purpose of varëäçrama culture.</div>
<div class="First">Those who oppose Vedic culture pass laws to make begging by saintlypersons a criminal act. They thus insult and persecute saintly beggars,considering them to be ordinary vagrants. A lazy person begging to avoid workis certainly abominable, but a saintly person dedicated to the service of theLord and practicing the discipline of begging to develop full dependence onthe Lord's mercy should be given all facility in human society. ÇrélaBhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura explains that there are three forms ofcollecting alms. Mädhukara is the process of imitating the bee, who collects atiny amount of nectar from each flower. In this way, the saintly person acceptsa very small amount from each person, avoiding social conflict. The processmentioned here is asaìkÿpta, by which one indiscriminately approaches sevenhouses, being satisfied with whatever may be obtained. Präk-praëéta is thatprocess by which one establishes regular donors and collects one's maintenancefrom them. In this regard Çréla Véraräghava Äcärya has described the initialstage of sannyäsa, called kuöécaka, as follows. A man accepting the initial stageof sannyäsa arranges for his children or other relatives and well-wishers tobuild him a kuöé, or meditation cottage. He gives up worldly affairs and sitswithin the cottage, trying to remain free from lust, anger, greed, illusion and soon. According to the prescribed injunctions of regulated life, he accepts atri-daëòa, purifies himself with a waterpot, shaves his head (leaving a çikhä, ortuft), chants Gäyatré mantra on the sacred thread and wears saffron garments.Bathing regularly, cleansing, performing äcamana, chanting japa, studying theVedas, remaining celibate and meditating on the Lord, he receives regularsupplies of food from his children, friends and relatives. Accepting only thebare necessities of life, he remains fixed in his cottage up to the moment of liberation.</div>

By chanting and hearing theholy names of the Lord along with the Lord's glories and pastimes, onenaturally drifts away from the field of material sense gratification. Goodassociation with Lord Kåñëa and His devotees automatically vanquishes uselessmaterial association, and one is able to carry out the Vedic injunctions meantto lift the conditioned soul out of the material field and onto the liberatedplatform of Kåñëa consciousness.

<div class="First">"Offering gifts in charity, accepting charitable gifts, revealing one's mind inconfidence, inquiring confidentially, accepting prasädam and offeringprasädam are the six symptoms of love shared by one devotee and another."One who thus learns to associate with the Lord's devotees actually remainsinsulated from the contamination of material life. By pure association onegradually understands the name, form, qualities, associates, pastimes anddevotional service of Lord Çré Kåñëa, and thus even in this lifetime one canbecome a resident of the spiritual world. In the association of pure devoteesthere is no material contamination and no useless discussion, since all puredevotees are fully engaged twenty-four hours a day in the loving service of theLord. By the influence of such devotees, one develops equal vision(sama-darçana) and sees the realized knowledge of Kåñëa consciousnesseverywhere. As one begins to understand his eternal relationship with LordKåñëa, he becomes ätma-vän, situated in his constitutional position. Anadvanced Vaiñëava, constantly enjoying the mellows of loving devotionalservice and carrying out the mission of the Lord on the earth, is ätma-kréòa,one who enjoys life within the internal potency of the Supreme Lord. Theadvanced devotee remains constantly attracted to the Supreme Lord and Hisdevotees and is therefore ätma-rata, fully satisfied by constant engagement indevotional service. One cannot possibly develop the exalted qualitiesmentioned here without becoming an unalloyed devotee of Lord Kåñëa. Onewho is envious of the Lord and His devotees becomes attracted to badassociation, gradually loses control of the senses and falls down into thenetwork of impious life. The innumerable varieties of nondevotees are likebranches sprouting from the single tree of enviousness of the Supreme Lord,Kåñëa, and their association should be given up by all means.Without unalloyed devotional service to the Lord, one loses touch with thedesire and mission of the Personality of Godhead and becomes attracted toworshiping the wonderful male and female creations of the Lord's illusoryenergy—demigods, demigoddesses, celebrities, politicians, prostitutes, etc. Inthis way, one foolishly considers something besides Lord Kåñëa to be supremelywonderful. Actually, Lord Kåñëa is the only true object of worship for thosedesiring to experience unlimited beauty and pleasure. By seriously taking toKåñëa consciousness one can realize the transcendental position of Lord Kåñëaand gradually develop all of the qualities mentioned in this verse.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">One who is engaged exclusively in the devotional service of the Lord in oneof the five principal relationships is to be known as a pure Vaiñëava. Becauseof his advanced stage of love of Godhead, a pure devotee is able to constantlychant the glories of the Lord without material hindrance. He is not interestedin anything except Lord Kåñëa and never considers himself to be qualitativelydifferent from the Lord. One who is still attracted by the gross material bodyand subtle material mind, which cover the eternal soul, continues to seehimself as different from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thismisconception is due to false identification with matter. With senses purifiedof material contamination, one must serve the Lord, who is the master of allsenses, and thus one's devotional service is considered free from discrepancy.One who ignores the injunctions of Vedic literature uselessly wastes hissense activity in illusory material activities. He falsely considers himself to bedifferent from Lord Kåñëa and therefore imagines that he possesses an interestindependent of the Lord's interest. There is no possibility that such a personcan achieve steadiness in life, because the material field of action is constantlybeing shifted and transformed by the disturbing influence of time. If a devoteebegins to cultivate an interest apart from the loving service of the Lord, hismeditation on his oneness with the Lord will be disturbed and overturned.When the mind deviates from the lotus feet of the Lord, the duality of materialnature again becomes prominent within the mind, and one resumes a workprogram based on the three modes of material nature. One who is not fixed inone's own relationship with the Supreme Lord cannot be fearless or steady andis deprived of the shelter of Lord Çré Kåñëa. Therefore one should seriouslycontemplate, as described in this verse, one's identity as a small particle ofconsciousness not different from the supreme consciousness, Lord Kåñëa. Thus one should remain steady in Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="First">In the Western countries people are generally so dull that they cannotdistinguish between a saintly beggar and an ordinary hobo or hippie.

The authorof this book remembers entering the Kåñëa consciousness society as anarrogant university student and being quickly humbled by the process ofbegging on the street on behalf of Kåñëa. This process is not theoretical butactually purifies one's existence by forcing one to offer respect to all others.Unless one offers respect to others, one's begging will be fruitless. Also, bybegging one will not often eat very sumptuously. This is good because whenthe tongue is controlled the other senses are quickly pacified.

<div class="First">This verse describes the paramahaàsa stage of life, in which there is nofurther need for rituals, external paraphernalia or rules and regulations. Acompletely realized jïäna-yogé pursuing liberation, or beyond that, a perfectdevotee of the Lord who does not desire even liberation, has no further desirefor material engagement. When one completely purifies the mind, there is nopossibility of sinful behavior. Rules and regulations are meant for guiding thosewho have a tendency to act in ignorance or for personal gratification, but onewho is perfect in spiritual consciousness can move freely, as described here bythe Lord. One who tends to drive a car recklessly or who is unfamiliar with thelocal road conditions certainly needs the discipline of elaborate road signs andpolice enforcement of traffic laws. A perfectly safe driver, however, isthoroughly familiar with the local road conditions. He has no real need for theenforcement officials or the speed limits and caution signs meant for thoseunfamiliar with the road. A pure devotee of the Lord desires nothing exceptservice to the Lord; he automatically fulfills the purport of all negative andpositive injunctions, which is to always remember Kåñëa and never forget Him.One should not, however, artificially imitate the exalted position of aparamahaàsa devotee, for such imitation will quickly ruin one's spiritual career.</div>

A self-realizedsoul is a servant of Lord Kåñëa and not of rules and regulations. Nevertheless, atranscendentalist strictly complies with regular duties for the pleasure of theSupreme Lord. In other words, one who is advanced in loving devotionalservice to Lord Kåñëa spontaneously moves according to the will of theSupreme. One who is perfectly situated in spiritual realization cannot becomea servant of the material body or of rules and regulations concerning thematerial body. However, this verse and other similar statements in Vedicscriptures should not be ignorantly misinterpreted to justify immoral,whimsical behavior.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa explained in verse 32 of this chapter that all material andspiritual objects are expansions of His potency. By realized knowledge of theLord one gives up the illusion that anything, anywhere, at any time, can beseparate from Lord Kåñëa. Lord Kåñëa has also explained, however, that onemust keep the material body and mind fit for executing devotional service;therefore even a self-realized soul may sometimes appear to accept or rejectcertain conditions or objects within this world. Such brief apparent duality ofconcentration upon something other than Kåñëa does not change the liberatedstatus of a self-realized soul, who achieves at the time of death the sameopulences as Lord Kåñëa in the spiritual world. The function of illusion is toseparate one from Lord Kåñëa, but the brief and occasional appearance ofduality in the behavior or mentality of a pure devotee never separates himfrom the Lord. It does not constitute actual illusion, for it lacks the essentialfunction of illusion, namely, the separation of one from Lord Kåñëa.Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura describes the self-realized devoteesas follows. The devotee of the Lord does not see anything as separate fromLord Kåñëa and thus does not consider himself to be a permanent resident ofthe material world. At every moment the devotee is moved by his desire toserve Lord Kåñëa. Just as those who are inclined to sense gratification passtheir time making arrangements for their enjoyment, similarly the devoteesare busy throughout the day arranging their devotional service to Lord Kåñëa.Therefore they have no time to act like materialistic sense enjoyers. Toordinary persons it may seem that a pure devotee is seeing something asseparate from Kåñëa, but a pure devotee is actually fixed in his status as aliberated soul and is guaranteed to achieve a spiritual body in the kingdom ofGod. Ordinary, materialistic persons cannot always understand the activitiesof a pure devotee of the Lord, and thus they may try to minimize his position,considering him to be the same as themselves. At the end of life, however, theresults achieved by the devotees of the Lord and ordinary materialists are vastly different.</div>

In any social or occupational division of humansociety one must be a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead andworship Him alone. The bona fide spiritual master is the representative ofLord Kåñëa, and worship of the äcärya goes directly to the lotus feet of theLord. Although ordinary householders are sometimes ordered by Vedicinjunctions to worship particular demigods or forefathers, one shouldremember that Lord Kåñëa is within all living entities. As stated here,sarva-bhüteñu mad-bhävaù. The pure devotees of the Lord worship the Lordalone, and those who cannot come to the standard of pure devotional serviceshould at least meditate upon the Personality of Godhead within the demigodsand all other living entities, understanding that all religious processes areultimately meant for the pleasure of the Lord. In the course of missionary workeven pure devotees must deal with government leaders and other prominentmembers of society, sometimes praising such persons and complying with theirorders. Yet because the devotees are always meditating on Lord Kåñëa situatedas the Supersoul within everyone, they are therefore acting for the Lord'spleasure and not for the pleasure of any ordinary human being. Those personsdealing with different demigods in the course of their varëäçrama dutiesshould similarly see the Lord as the basis of everything. They shouldconcentrate on pleasing the Supreme Lord by all activities. This stage of life iscalled love of God, and it brings one to the point of actual liberation.</div>

<div class="Chapnum">19. The Perfection of Spiritual Knowledge</div>
<div class="First">This chapter describes how those who practice speculative knowledgeeventually give up their method, whereas the pure devotees remain engaged indevotional service eternally. Also described are the different practices of the yogés, beginning with yama.</div>
<div class="First">The Supreme Lord, Çré Kåñëa, stated to Uddhava, "One who is actuallywise, who knows the truth of the self and possesses transcendental insight,rejects this world of dualities and the so-called knowledge meant forfacilitating enjoyment of it. He instead engages himself in trying to satisfy theSupreme Personality of Godhead, the master of all. This is pure bhakti-yoga.Transcendental knowledge is greater than such ordinary pious activities aschanting of mantras, but pure devotional service is greater than even knowledge."</div>
<div class="First">After this, Lord Kåñëa, requested by Çré Uddhava to describe in full detailpure transcendental knowledge and devotional service, related the sameinstructions that the greatest of Vaiñëavas, Bhéñmadeva, gave on these topicsto Çré Yudhiñöhira on the occasion of the battle at Kurukñetra. Following this,after being asked about yama and the other practices of yoga, the Lordenumerated the twelve kinds of yama beginning with nonviolence, and thetwelve kinds of niyama, beginning with bodily cleanliness.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: A self-realized person who has cultivated scriptural knowledge up to the point of enlightenment and who is free from impersonal speculation, understanding the material universe to be simply illusion, should surrender unto Me both that knowledge and the means by which he achieved it.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Mäyä-mätram idaà jïätvä indicates knowledge that the eternal spirit souland the eternal Personality of Godhead are completely separate from thetemporary qualities of the material world. The word vidyä-çruta-sampannameans that one should cultivate Vedic knowledge for the purpose ofenlightenment and not to make a show of mysticism, intellectuality orimpersonal speculation. Having neutralized the illusory effects of mäyä, oneshould then transfer one's attention to the Supreme Personality of Godhead,surrendering the process of philosophical negation to the Lord Himself. ÇrélaJéva Gosvämé gives the example that when there is danger the king may issueweapons to private citizens, but after military victory the individual citizens return the weapons to the king.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains this point of this verse asfollows. Somehow or other the living entity has to free himself from materialillusion, which has covered him since time immemorial. Cultivatingdesirelessness and renunciation by practice of the mystic yoga system, theliving entity develops knowledge of illusion and may thus lift himself abovethe reach of material ignorance. However, once one is situated on thetranscendental platform, both knowledge of illusion and the process ofacquiring such knowledge have no further practical application. ÇrélaViçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura gives the example that a man may be hauntedby the ghost of a snake or a tiger. As long as the man is possessed and thinks, "Iam a snake" or "I am a tiger," attempts will be made to counteract the ghostlyinfluence by application of jewels, mantras and herbs. But when the man isfreed from possession by ghosts, he again thinks, "I am Mr. So-and-so, the sonof Mr. So-and-so," and returns to his original nature. At that time the jewels,mantras and herbs have no further immediate application. The word vidyä inthis verse thus indicates knowledge acquired through philosophical analysis,mystic yoga, austerities and renunciation. Such knowledge of the temporary,illusory nature of this world counteracts ignorance, and there are many Vedicscriptures that train the living entity in such knowledge. Gradually one givesup his false identification with the material body and mind and with thosematerial objects that interact with the body and mind. Having realized suchcounteractive knowledge, one must engage in the loving service of thePersonality of Godhead and become a pure devotee. When one is completelyperfect in Kåñëa consciousness, there is naturally little interest in theinnumerable details of illusion, and gradually one is transferred to the spiritual world.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the previous verse Lord Kåñëa stated that one should ultimatelysurrender unto Him that knowledge by which the material world is seen asillusion. Material attachments are certainly problems for the living entities,since they are diseases of the spirit soul. One who has contracted a skin diseasethat causes terrible itching gains only flickering relief by scratching theunbearable sores. If he does not scratch he suffers greatly, but by scratching,even though there is an instantaneous sensation of pleasure, unbearable miseryfollows as the itching increases. Real happiness is not found in scratching one'sskin infections but rather in becoming free from such disease. Conditionedsouls are harassed by many illusory desires, and in desperation they try togratify their senses through the hopeless scratching processes of illicit sex,meat-eating, gambling and intoxication. They further try to gain reliefthrough material society, friendship and love, but the result is unbearablesuffering. Real happiness is to eliminate completely the itching disease ofmaterial desire. Since material desire is a disease of the soul, one must acquireknowledge to treat this disease and eliminate it. Such therapeutic knowledge isessential as long as one is diseased, but when one is fully healthy, suchtechnical medical knowledge is no longer interesting to the healthy person,and he may leave such knowledge to the doctors. Similarly, in the advancedstage of Kåñëa consciousness one need not think continually of one's personalproblems but may rather think of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, LordKåñëa, with love and devotion. Lord Kåñëa advises in the previous verse thatone should eliminate one's personal problems through technical knowledge ofillusion. After giving up constant meditation on such problems, one can thenbecome a lover of God. Lord Kåñëa certainly guides each and every sinceredevotee internally within the heart and externally through the bona fidespiritual master. In this way, Lord Kåñëa gradually trains His sincere devoteesto give up their irrational attachment to dead matter. Once freedom has beenachieved, a devotee begins to seriously cultivate his relationship with Lord Kåñëa in the spiritual sky.</div>
<div class="First">One may falsely think that just as at a certain stage of advancement oneceases to concentrate on technical, analytic knowledge of illusion, so, atanother stage one may give up loving devotional service to Lord Kåñëa. Tonullify such speculation Lord Çré Kåñëa here states in various ways that He isthe supreme eternal goal of all truly learned human beings. Indeed, the mostprominent scholars within the universe are the sages, such as the fourKumäras, who accept Lord Kåñëa as their only worshipable object. Becausethey have discovered that they are eternal fragmental portions of the SupremePersonality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, they are not interested in fruitive activitiesand mental speculation. Lord Kåñëa awards celestial bliss and freedom fromanxiety to His sincere followers, who have no purpose or beloved object in life other than the Lord.</div>

Just as a father is always proud of his son'seducation, similarly, Lord Kåñëa becomes very happy to see the living entitiesacquiring a sound spiritual education and thus making progress on the way back home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear Lord, for one who is being tormented on the terrible path of birth and death and is constantly overwhelmed by the threefold miseries, I do not see any possible shelter other than Your two lotus feet, which are just like a refreshing umbrella that pours down showers of delicious nectar.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa, recognizing Uddhava's highly intellectual nature, hasrepeatedly recommended to him that one should achieve perfection bycultivation of transcendental knowledge. But the Lord has also clearlydemonstrated that such knowledge must bring one to the point of lovingdevotional service to Him, for otherwise it is useless. In this verse Çré Uddhavacorroborates Lord Kåñëa's statements that actual happiness is obtained bysurrendering to His lotus feet. When the incarnation of Godhead PåthuMahäräja was crowned, the demigod Väyu presented him with an umbrellathat constantly sprayed fine particles of water. The Lord's two lotus feet aresimilarly compared here to a wonderful umbrella that produces a constantshower of delicious nectar, the bliss of Kåñëa consciousness. Normally,speculative analytic knowledge terminates in an impersonal conception of theAbsolute Truth, but the so-called bliss of merging into impersonal spiritualexistence can never be compared to the bliss of Kåñëa consciousness, as statedhere by Çré Uddhava. Kåñëa consciousness thus automatically constitutesperfect knowledge, since Lord Kåñëa is the ultimate shelter of all livingentities. The words abhihatasya and abhivarñät are significant in this verse.Abhihatasya indicates one who is being defeated on all sides by the onslaughtof material nature, whereas abhivarñät indicates a downpour of nectar thateliminates all of the problems of material existence. By our intelligence weshould look beyond the dull material body and nonsensical material mind toobserve the unlimited shower of blissful nectar coming from the two lotus feetof Lord Kåñëa. Then our real good fortune will begin.</div>

<div class="Translation"> O almighty Lord, please be merciful and uplift this hopeless living entity who has fallen into the dark hole of material existence, where the snake of time has bitten him. In spite of such abominable conditions, this poor living entity has tremendous desire to relish the most insignificant material happiness. Please save me, my Lord, by pouring down the nectar of Your instructions, which awaken one to spiritual freedom.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Material life, so much cherished by the nondevotees, is here compared to adark hole filled with poisonous snakes. In material life there is certainly noclear understanding of one's ultimate identity, of God or of the universe.Everything is vague and dark. In material life the poisonous snake of time isalways threatening, and at any moment our near and dear ones will be killedby the mortal fangs of the serpent. Ultimately, we ourselves will also be bittenand killed by the poisonous effects of time. The word sampatitam indicates thatthe falldown of the living entity is complete. In other words, he cannot get upagain. Çré Uddhava therefore appeals to the Lord to be kind to these poorfallen souls, humbly represented by his own self. If one receives the Lord'smercy, then even without any further qualification one can go back home,back to Godhead; and without the mercy of Lord Kåñëa, the most learned,austere, powerful, wealthy or beautiful man will be pathetically crushed by thematerial world's machinery of illusion. The Supreme Personality of Godhead,as described here, is mahänubhäva, or the greatest, most powerful and mostmerciful personality, whose influence extends everywhere. The Lord's mercy ismanifest in the form of His nectarean instructions such as Bhagavad-gétä andthe Uddhava-gétä, being spoken here. The word kñudra-sukhoru-tarñam revealsthe irony of material existence. Although material happiness is kñudra, orridiculous and insignificant, our desire to enjoy it is uru, tremendous. Ourdisproportionate hankering to enjoy dead matter is certainly an illusory stateof mind, and it gives us constant distress, keeping us bound up in the dark holeof material existence. Every living entity should put aside his false prestigebased on ephemeral bodily qualifications and appeal sincerely to the SupremeLord, Kåñëa, for His mercy. The Lord hears every sincere appeal, from eventhe most fallen soul, and the effects of the Lord's mercy are wonderful.Although jïänés, yogés and fruitive workers are laboriously endeavoring toachieve their respective goals, their position is precarious and uncertain.Simply by achieving the mercy of Lord Kåñëa, however, one can very easilyattain the highest perfection of life. If even one who is not a great or puredevotee of Lord Kåñëa sincerely appeals to the Lord for His mercy, the Lord is sure to give it generously.</div>

<div class="Translation"> I personally approve of that knowledge by which one sees the combination of nine, eleven, five and three elements in all living entities, and ultimately one element within those twenty-eight.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The nine elements are material nature, the living entity, the mahat-tattva,false ego, and the five objects of sense perception, namely sound, touch, form,taste and aroma. The eleven elements are the five working senses (the voice,hands, legs, anus and genital) plus the five knowledge-acquiring senses (theears, touch, eyes, tongue and nostrils), along with the coordinative sense, themind. The five elements are the five physical elements, namely earth, water,fire, air and sky, and the three elements are the three modes of materialnature—goodness, passion and ignorance. All living entities, from mightyLord Brahmä down to an insignificant weed, manifest material bodiescomposed of these twenty-eight elements. The one element within alltwenty-eight is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supersoul, who isall-pervading within the material and spiritual worlds.One can easily understand that the material universe is composed ofinnumerable causes and effects. Since Lord Kåñëa is the cause of all causes, allsecondary causes and their effects are ultimately nondifferent from thePersonality of Godhead. This understanding constitutes real knowledge, or jïäna, which is essential for perfecting one's life.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> When one no longer sees the twenty-eight separated material elements, which arise from a single cause, but rather sees the cause itself, the Personality of Godhead—at that time one's direct experience is called vijïäna, or self-realization.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The difference between jïäna (ordinary Vedic knowledge) and vijïäna(self-realization) can be understood as follows. A conditioned soul, althoughcultivating Vedic knowledge, continues to identify himself to some extent withthe material body and mind and consequently with the material universe. Intrying to understand the world he lives in, the conditioned soul learns throughVedic knowledge that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the one supremecause of all material manifestations. He comes to understand the world aroundhim, which he accepts more or less as his world. As he progresses in spiritualrealization, breaking through the barrier of bodily identification, and realizesthe existence of the eternal soul, he gradually identifies himself as part andparcel of the spiritual world, Vaikuëöha. At that time he is no longerinterested in the Personality of Godhead merely as the supreme explanation ofthe material world; rather, he begins to reorient his entire mode ofconsciousness so that the central object of his attention is the Personality ofGodhead. Such a reorientation is required, since the Supreme Lord is thefactual center and cause of everything. A self-realized soul in the stage ofvijïäna thus experiences the Personality of Godhead not merely as the creatorof the material world but as the supreme living entity existing blissfully in Hisown eternal context. As one progresses in one's realization of the SupremeLord in His own abode in the spiritual sky, one gradually becomes disinterestedin the material universe and ceases to define the Supreme Lord in terms of Histemporary manifestations. A self-realized soul in the stage of vijïäna is not atall attracted by objects that are created, maintained and ultimately destroyed.The stage of jïäna is the preliminary stage of knowledge for those stillidentifying themselves in terms of the material universe, whereas vijïäna is themature stage of knowledge for those who see themselves as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Commencement, termination and maintenance are the stages of material causation. That which consistently accompanies all these material phases from one creation to another and remains alone when all material phases are annihilated is the one eternal.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Lord here reiterates that the one Supreme Personality of Godhead isthe basis of unlimited material variety. Material activity is a chain ofcause-and-effect relationships by which innumerable objects are produced. Aparticular material effect is converted into a subsequent cause, and when thecausal phase is terminated, the effect disappears. Fire causes firewood to burnto ashes, and when the causal function of fire is finished, fire itself, which wasthe effect of a previous cause, is also terminated. The simple fact is that allmaterial objects are created, maintained and ultimately annihilated by thesupreme potency of the Lord. And when the entire field of material cause andeffect is withdrawn, so that all cause-effect relationships vanish, thePersonality of Godhead remains in His own abode. Therefore, althoughinnumerable objects may function as causes, they are not the ultimate orsupreme cause. Only the Personality of Godhead is the absolute cause.Similarly, although material things may exist, they do not always exist. ThePersonality of Godhead alone has absolute existence. By the process of jïäna,or knowledge, one should understand the supreme position of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> From the four types of evidence—Vedic knowledge, direct experience, traditional wisdom and logical induction—one can understand the temporary, insubstantial situation of the material world, by which one becomes detached from the duality of this world.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the çruti, or Vedic literature, it is clearly stated that everything emanatesfrom the Absolute Truth, is maintained by the Absolute Truth and at the endis conserved within the Absolute Truth. Similarly, by direct experience we canobserve the creation and destruction of great empires, cities, buildings, bodiesand so on. Furthermore, we find all around the world traditional wisdomwarning people that things in this world cannot last. Finally, by logicalinduction we can easily conclude that nothing in this world is permanent.Material sense gratification—up to the highest possible living standard foundin the heavenly planets or down to the lowest conditions in the mostrepugnant precincts of hell—is always unsteady and prone to collapse at anymoment. One should therefore develop vairägya, detachment, as stated here.Another meaning of this verse is that the four types of evidence cited hereare often mutually contradictory in their description of the highest truth. Oneshould therefore be detached from the duality of mundane evidence, includingthe portions of the Vedas that deal with the material world. Instead, oneshould accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the actual authority.Both in Bhagavad-gétä and here in Çrémad-Bhägavatam Lord Kåñëa ispersonally speaking, and thus there is no need to enter into the bewilderingnetwork of competing systems of mundane logic. One can directly hear fromthe Absolute Truth Himself and immediately acquire perfect knowledge. Onethereby becomes detached from inferior systems of knowledge, which cause one to hover on the material mental platform.</div>

The supremestage of conscious existence is pure love of Kåñëa, and one who is addicted toLord Kåñëa desires to constantly drink the nectar of such topics. Lord Kåñëahas given an extensive survey of many aspects of human civilization, includingthe varëäçrama-dharma system and the processes of distinguishing betweenmatter and spirit, renouncing sense gratification, and so forth. Now Uddhavais hankering to hear specifically about pure devotional service to Lord Kåñëa, and the Lord thus turns to that topic.</div>

<div class="Translation"> When one's peaceful consciousness, strengthened by the mode of goodness, is fixed on the Personality of Godhead, one achieves religiosity, knowledge, detachment and opulence.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">A pure devotee becomes peaceful, çänta, by desiring everything for theservice of the Lord and nothing for himself. He is strengthened by thetranscendental, or purified, mode of goodness and thus achieves the supremereligious principle of directly serving the Lord. He also achieves jïäna, orknowledge of the Lord's form and his own spiritual body, detachment frommaterial piety and sin, and the opulences of the spiritual world. One who isnot a pure devotee of the Lord, however, but whose devotion is mixed with afascination for mystic knowledge, is strengthened by the material mode ofgoodness. Through his meditation on the Lord he achieves the lesser results ofdharma (piety in the mode of goodness), jïäna (knowledge of spirit andmatter) and vairägya (detachment from the lower modes of nature).Ultimately, one should be a pure devotee of the Lord, since even the best thematerial world has to offer is most insignificant compared to the kingdom of God.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> When consciousness is fixed on the material body, home and other, similar objects of sense gratification, one spends one's life chasing after material objects with the help of the senses. Consciousness, thus powerfully affected by the mode of passion, becomes dedicated to impermanent things, and in this way irreligion, ignorance, attachment and wretchedness arise.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the previous verse Lord Kåñëa explained the auspicious results of fixingthe mind in Him, and now the opposite is explained. Rajas-valam indicatesthat one's passion grows so strong that one commits sinful activities and reapsall types of misfortune. Although materialistic people are blind to theirimpending wretchedness, one can confirm by all types of evidence—namelyVedic injunctions, direct observation, traditional wisdom and inductivelogic—that the result of violating the laws of God is disastrous.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Absorbing the intelligence in Me constitutes mental equilibrium, and complete discipline of the senses is self-control. Tolerance means patiently enduring unhappiness, and steadfastness occurs when one conquers the tongue and genitals. The greatest charity is to give up all aggression toward others, and renunciation of lust is understood to be real austerity. Real heroism is to conquer one's natural tendency to enjoy material life, and reality is seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead everywhere. Truthfulness means to speak the truth in a pleasing way, as declared by great sages. Cleanliness is detachment in fruitive activities, whereas renunciation is the sannyäsa order of life. The true desirable wealth for human beings is religiousness, and I, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, am sacrifice. Religious remuneration is devotion to the äcärya with the purpose of acquiring spiritual instruction, and the greatest strength is the präëäyäma system of breath control.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa here describes those qualities that are desirable for personsadvancing in human life. Çama, or "mental equilibrium," means to fix theintelligence in Lord Kåñëa. Mere peacefulness without Kåñëa consciousness is adull and useless state of mind. Dama, or "discipline," means first to controlone's own senses. If one wants to discipline one's children, disciples orfollowers without controlling one's own senses, one becomes a merelaughingstock. Tolerance means to patiently endure unhappiness, such as thatprovoked by the insults or negligence of others. One must also sometimesaccept material inconvenience to carry out the injunctions of scriptures, andthat unhappiness must also be patiently endured. If one is not tolerant of theinsults and abuse of others, nor tolerant of the inconveniences that may arisefrom following authorized religious scriptures, it is simply foolishness for himto make a whimsical show of tolerating extreme heat, cold and pain and so on,just to impress others. Concerning steadfastness, if one does not control thetongue and genitals, then any other steadfastness is useless. Real charity meansto renounce all aggression toward others. If one gives money to charitablecauses but at the same time engages in exploitative business enterprises orabusive political tactics, one's charity is worth nothing at all. Austerity meansto give up lust and sense gratification and to observe prescribed vows such asEkädaçé; it does not mean inventing whimsical methods of torturing thematerial body. Real heroism is to conquer one's lower nature. Certainlyeveryone likes to propagate his own fame as a brilliant person, but everyone isalso subject to lust, anger, greed and so forth. Therefore, if one can conquerthese lower characteristics generated from the modes of passion and ignorance,one is a greater hero than those who merely destroy their political opponents through intrigue and violence.</div>
<div class="First">One can develop equal vision by giving up jealousy and envy and byrecognizing the existence of the soul within every material body. This attitudepleases the Supreme Lord, who then reveals Himself, solidifying forever one'sequal vision. Merely describing things that exist does not constitute the lastword in the perception of reality. One must also see the true spiritual equalityof all living entities and all situations. Truthfulness means that one shouldspeak in a pleasing way so that there will be a beneficial effect. If one becomesattached to pointing out the faults of others in the name of truth, then suchfaultfinding will not be appreciated by saintly persons. The bona fide spiritualmaster speaks the truth in such a way that people can elevate themselves tothe spiritual platform, and one should learn this art of truthfulness. If one isattached to material things, his body and mind are understood to be alwayspolluted. Cleanliness therefore means to give up material attachment, notmerely to frequently rinse one's skin with water. Real renunciation is giving upone's false sense of proprietorship over one's relatives and wife, and not justgiving away material objects, while real wealth is to be religious. Sacrifice isthe Personality of Godhead Himself, because the performer of sacrifice, to besuccessful, must absorb his consciousness in the Personality of Godhead andnot in temporary, material rewards that may accrue from sacrifice. Realreligious remuneration means that one should serve saintly persons who canenlighten one with spiritual knowledge. One may offer remuneration to hisspiritual master, who has enlightened him, by distributing the same knowledgeto others, thereby pleasing the äcärya. Preaching work thus constitutes thehighest form of remuneration. By performing the präëäyäma system ofrespiratory control, one can easily subdue the mind, and one who can in thisway perfectly control the restless mind is the most powerful person.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Actual opulence is My own nature as the Personality of Godhead, through which I exhibit the six unlimited opulences. The supreme gain in life is devotional service to Me, and actual education is nullifying the false perception of duality within the soul. Real modesty is to be disgusted with improper activities, and beauty is to possess good qualities such as detachment. Real happiness is to transcend material happiness and unhappiness, and real misery is to be implicated in searching for sex pleasure. A wise man is one who knows the process of freedom from bondage, and a fool is one who identifies with his material body and mind. The real path in life is that which leads to Me, and the wrong path is sense gratification, by which consciousness is bewildered. Actual heaven is the predominance of the mode of goodness, whereas hell is the predominance of ignorance. I am everyone's true friend, acting as the spiritual master of the entire universe, and one's home is the human body. My dear friend Uddhava, one who is enriched with good qualities is actually said to be rich, and one who is unsatisfied in life is actually poor. A wretched person is one who cannot control his senses, whereas one who is not attached to sense gratification is a real controller. One who attaches himself to sense gratification is the opposite, a slave. Thus, Uddhava, I have elucidated all of the matters about which you inquired. There is no need for a more elaborate description of these good and bad qualities, since to constantly see good and bad is itself a bad quality. The best quality is to transcend material good and evil.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Supreme Personality of Godhead is naturally full of six opulences,namely unlimited beauty, wealth, fame, knowledge, strength and renunciation.Therefore the greatest profit in life is to achieve personal loving service to theLord, who is naturally the reservoir of all pleasure. Real education means togive up the false idea that anything is separate from the Lord, the source of allpotencies. Similarly, one should not falsely consider the individual soul to bedifferent or separate from the Supreme Soul. Mere bashfulness does notconstitute modesty. One should spontaneously withdraw in disgust from sinfulactivities; then one is actually modest or humble. One who is satisfied in Kåñëaconsciousness and thus does not seek material pleasure or suffer materialunhappiness is considered to be actually situated in happiness. The mostwretched person is one addicted to sex pleasure, and a wise man is one whoknows the process of freedom from such material bondage. A fool is one whogives up his eternal friendship with Lord Kåñëa and instead identifies himselfwith his own temporary material body, mind, society, community and family.The real path in life is not simply a modern interstate highway or, in moresimple cultures, a footpath free of thorns and mud. It is that path that leads toLord Kåñëa. The wrong path in life is not simply a road having many thieves ortollbooths; it is that path that leads one to utter confusion in material sensegratification. A heavenly situation is that in which the mode of goodnesspredominates, rather than that found on the planet of Indra, where passionand ignorance sometimes disturb the celestial atmosphere. Hell is anywherethe mode of ignorance is predominant, and not merely the hellish planets,where, according to Lord Çiva, a pure devotee can think of Kåñëa and remainhappy. Our actual friend in life is the bona fide spiritual master, who saves usfrom all dangers. Among all gurus, Lord Kåñëa is Himself the jagat-guru, orspiritual master of the entire universe. In material life our own material body isour immediate home, rather than some structure of bricks, cement, stone andwood. A rich man is one who possesses innumerable good qualities; he is not aneurotic fool with a large bank account. A poor man is one who is unsatisfied,which is self-explanatory. One who cannot control his senses is certainlywretched and miserable in life, whereas one who detaches himself frommaterial life is actually a lord or controller. In modern times there areremnants of aristocracy in Europe and other countries, but such so-called lordsoften display the habits of lower forms of life. A real lord is one who conquersmaterial existence by rising to the spiritual platform. A person who is attachedto material life will undoubtedly manifest the opposites of all the good qualitiesmentioned here, and he is thus the symbol of going backward in life. The Lordconcludes His analysis by stating that there is no need for further elaborationof these good and bad qualities. Indeed, the purpose of life is to transcendmaterially good and bad qualities and come to the liberated platform of pureKåñëa consciousness. This point will be further explained in the following chapter.</div>
<div class="First">Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Nineteenth Chapter, ofthe Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Perfection of Spiritual Knowledge."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">20. Pure Devotional Service Surpasses Knowledge and</div>
<div class="First"> Detachment</div>
<div class="First">The processes of karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga and bhakti-yoga are explained inthis chapter, in terms of the presence of different good and bad qualities in particular candidates.</div>
<div class="First">The Vedic çästras are the words expressing the order of the SupremePersonality of Godhead. In these Vedic literatures is found an outlook ofduality, based on such concepts as the varëäçrama system, and at the same timethe Vedas reject this dualistic vision. Uddhava, desiring to understand thereason why the scriptures contain such conflicting ideas, and how these mightbe reconciled, inquired from Lord Çré Kåñëa about this matter. In response theSupreme Lord replied that the Vedas describe the processes of karma-yoga,jïäna-yoga and bhakti-yoga for facilitating the attainment of liberation.Karma-yoga is designated for those persons who are not detached and who arefull of gross desires; jïäna-yoga is for those who are detached from the fruits ofactivity and have given up material endeavors; and bhakti-yoga is for thosepersons who have taken to the principle of yukta-vairägya, appropriaterenunciation. As long as one has not become uninterested in enjoying thefruits of one's work, or as long as one's faith in the topics of discussion of theSupreme Personality of Godhead on the path of devotional service has notawakened, then one must continue to fulfill all the prescribed duties of hiskarma. But neither the renunciant nor the devotee of the Supreme Lord need carry out ritualistic duties.</div>
<div class="First">Persons who follow their own duty, who abandon that which is forbiddenand who are free from greed and other unhealthy characteristics attain eithermonistic knowledge or else, if they are fortunate, devotion to the SupremePersonality of Godhead. Such knowledge and devotion can be achieved in thehuman form of life, which is therefore a desirable object both for those livingin hell and for the demigods. The human body, even though it awards thewhole purpose of existence in the form of knowledge and devotion, isephemeral; therefore one who is discriminating should soberly strive forliberation before death comes. The human body is like a boat, Çré Gurudeva isthe helmsman, and the mercy of the Supreme Lord is the favorable breeze. Ifthe person who has attained such a rare boat in the form of the human bodydoes not desire to cross over the ocean of material existence, he is in fact thekiller of the soul. The mind is fickle, but one should not indifferently allow itto act as it will. Rather, one should conquer the senses and the vital air and byintelligence endowed with the qualities of goodness should bring the mind under control.</div>
<div class="First">Until the mind finally becomes stable, one should continue to meditateabout the process of the creation of all material things in sequence from subtleto gross and of their destruction in reverse sequence of gross to subtle. Onewho has a sense of detachment and renunciation can give up falseidentification with the body and other sense objects by constantly studying theinstructions of his spiritual master. By the yoga practice of yama, niyama andso forth, by cultivation of transcendental knowledge and by worship of andmeditation upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can remember the Supersoul.</div>
<div class="First">Virtue, or guëa, means to remain steadfast in the object of one's particularplatform of qualification. By developing the desire to reject one's accumulatedmaterial association by pursuing the injunctions of what is good and what isbad, all of one's inauspicious material activities become diminished. Bydevotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead all perfections areachieved. Anyone who renders service to the Supreme Lord by constantdevotional service will be able to steadily fix his mind upon the Supreme Lord,and thus all desires for sense gratification sitting within the heart will bedestroyed to the root. When one directly perceives the presence of theSupreme Lord, his false ego becomes completely eradicated; all of his doubtsare shattered, and heaps of material activities become diminished to nil. Forthis reason the devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead do notconsider knowledge and renunciation to be the means for achieving thehighest benefit. Only in the heart of a person who is devoid of material desireand disinterested in material things can devotional service to the Lord arise.The piety and impiety that result from ritualistic injunctions and prohibitionscannot be applied to the unalloyed pure devotees of the Supreme Lord.</div>

<div class="First">At the end of the previous chapter, Lord Kåñëa stated, guëa-doña-dåçir doñoguëas tübhaya-varjitaù: "Focusing upon material piety and sin is itself adiscrepancy, since actual piety means to transcend both of them." Çré Uddhavanow pursues this point so that Lord Kåñëa will give a more elaborateexplanation of this difficult subject matter. Çré Uddhava here states that theVedic literatures, which constitute the laws of God, deal with piety and sin;therefore, it must be clarified how one transcends activities recommended inthe Vedas. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, Uddhavasuddenly understood Lord Kåñëa's purpose in the words He had just spoken,and to induce the Lord to elaborate upon this interesting point Uddhava outwardly challenged the Lord's statement.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> According to Vedic literature, the superior and inferior varieties found in the human social system, varëäçrama, are due to pious and sinful modes of family planning. Thus piety and sin are constant points of reference in the Vedic analysis of the components of a given situation—namely the material ingredients, place, age and time. Indeed, the Vedas reveal the existence of material heaven and hell, which are certainly based on piety and sin.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Pratiloma indicates the combination of a superior woman with an inferiorman. For example, the vaidehaka community consists of those born of a çüdrafather and brähmaëa mother, whereas the sütas are those born from a kñatriyafather and a brähmaëa mother or from a çüdra father and kñatriya mother.Anuloma indicates those born from a superior father and inferior mother. Themürdhävasikta are those born of a brähmaëa father and kñatriya mother.Ambañöhas are those born from a brähmaëa father and vaiçya mother, and theyoften become medical men. Karaëa indicates those born of a vaiçya father andçüdra mother or of a kñatriya father and vaiçya mother. That such mixing ofcastes is not very much appreciated in the Vedic culture is demonstrated in thefirst chapter of Bhagavad-gétä. Arjuna was very worried that the death of somany kñatriyas on the battlefield would lead to the mixing of superior womenwith inferior men, and on those grounds he objected to fighting. In any case,the entire Vedic social system is based on distinguishing between piety and sin,and Çré Uddhava is encouraging the Lord to explain more elaborately Hisstatement that one should transcend both piety and sin.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">One might argue that while human beings are certainly prone to ignorance,the elevated forefathers and demigods are considered to be all-knowing withinuniversal affairs. If such superior beings would communicate with the earth,then everyone could bypass Vedic knowledge in achieving his personal desire.This concept is denied here by the words vedaç cakñuù. Even the demigods andforefathers have at best an ambiguous conception of supreme liberation, andeven in material affairs they are subject to personal frustration. Although thedemigods are all-powerful in awarding material benedictions to inferior speciessuch as human beings, they are sometimes thwarted in their personal programsof sense gratification. A rich businessman, for example, may have no difficultypaying the insignificant salary of one of his innumerable workers, but the samewealthy man may be completely frustrated in his dealings with his own familyand friends and may also be defeated in his attempts to expand his fortune byfurther investments. Although a rich man appears to be all-powerful to hissubordinate workers, he must personally struggle to fulfill his personal desires.Similarly, the demigods and forefathers encounter many difficulties inmaintaining and expanding their celestial standard of living. They musttherefore constantly take shelter of superior Vedic knowledge. Even in theadministration of cosmic affairs, they strictly follow the guidelines of theVedas, which are the laws of God. If such fabulous entities as demigods musttake shelter of the Vedas, we can just imagine the position of human beings,who are frustrated at virtually every step of their lives. Every human beingshould accept Vedic knowledge as the highest evidence in material andspiritual affairs. Uddhava points out to the Lord that if one accepts theauthority of Vedic knowledge, it is seemingly impossible to reject the conceptof material piety and sin. Thus Uddhava persists in examining the Lord'scontroversial statement at the end of the last chapter.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear Lord, the distinction observed between piety and sin comes from Your own Vedic knowledge and does not arise by itself. If the same Vedic literature subsequently nullifies such distinction between piety and sin, there will certainly be confusion.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the Bhagavad-gétä (15.15) Lord Kåñëa states, vedaiç ca sarvair aham evavedyaù: "By all the Vedas I am to be known. Indeed, I am the compiler ofVedanta, and I know the Veda as it is." Vedic knowledge emanates from thebreathing of the Personality of Godhead; therefore, whatever Lord Kåñëaspeaks is Veda, or perfect knowledge. The Vedic literatures are full ofdescriptions of piety and sin, but Lord Kåñëa's statement that one shouldtranscend piety and sin is also to be understood as Vedic knowledge. ÇréUddhava has understood this point and therefore requests Lord Kåñëa to clearup an apparent contradiction. Ultimately, the material world gives the livingentities a chance to satisfy their perverted desires and at the same timegradually achieve the liberation of going back home, back to Godhead. Thusmaterial piety must be considered a means and never an absolute end, sincethe material world itself is not absolute, being temporary and limited. ThePersonality of Godhead is Himself the reservoir of all virtue and goodness.Those persons and activities that please the Lord are to be considered virtuous,and those that displease Him are to be considered sinful. There cannot be anyother permanent definition of these terms. If one becomes a mundanemoralist, forgetting the Supreme Lord, one's position is certainly imperfect,and one will not achieve the ultimate goal of piety, going back home, back toGodhead. On the other hand, there is great fear among moralists that if thedistinction between piety and sin is minimized, people will commit manyatrocities in the name of God. In the modern world there is no clearunderstanding of spiritual authority, and moral men consider any appeal totranscend morality to be an invitation to fanaticism, anarchy, violence andcorruption. Thus they regard material moral principles as more important thandirectly trying to please God. Because this point is controversial, Uddhava isanxiously requesting the Lord to give a clear explanation.</div>

Besides these three there is absolutely no other means of elevation.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Ultimately, the goal of philosophical speculation, pious regulated work anddevotional service is the same—Kåñëa consciousness. As stated by the Lord in</div>

<div class="First">"All of them—as they surrender unto Me—I reward accordingly. Everyonefollows My path in all respects, O son of Påthä." Although all authorizedprocesses of human perfection ultimately lead to Kåñëa consciousness, or loveof God, various performers have specific propensities and qualifications andthus gravitate to different methods of self-realization. Lord Kåñëa heredescribes the three authorized processes together in order to emphasize thattheir ultimate goal is one. At the same time, philosophical speculation andregulated pious work can never be considered equal to pure love of Godhead,as the Lord has elaborately clarified in the previous chapters. The word trayaù,or "three," indicates that despite their ultimate oneness of purpose, the threepaths display diversity in progress and achievement. One cannot achieve thesame result by mere speculation or piety that one achieves by directlysurrendering to the Personality of Godhead, depending completely on Hismercy and friendship. The word karma here indicates work dedicated to thePersonality of Godhead. As described in Bhagavad-gétä (3.9),</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yajïärthät karmaëo 'nyatra</div>

<div class="First">"Work done as a sacrifice for Viñëu has to be performed, otherwise work bindsone to this material world. Therefore, O son of Kunté, perform your prescribedduties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always remain unattachedand free from bondage." In the process of jïäna, one seeks impersonalliberation by merging into the glaring effulgence of the Personality ofGodhead. Such liberation is considered hellish by the devotees, because bymerging one loses all awareness of the supreme blissful feature of the Lord asBhagavän, the supreme person. The performers of karma, or regulated work,seek the three aspects of human progress other than liberation—namelyreligiosity, economic development and sense gratification. The fruitiveworkers think that by exhausting each of their innumerable material desiresthey will gradually come out of the dark tunnel of material existence into theclear light of spiritual liberation. This process is very dangerous and uncertain,because not only is there virtually no limit to material desires, but even a slightflaw in the process of regulated work constitutes sin and throws one off thepath of progressive life. The devotees directly aim for love of Godhead and aretherefore most pleasing to the Supreme Lord. In any case, all three divisions ofVedic elevation depend completely on the mercy of Lord Kåñëa. One cannotprogress along any one of these paths without the blessings of the Lord. OtherVedic processes, such as austerity, charity and so forth, are included within the three primary divisions described here.</div>

The devotee thusbecomes fearless by meditating on the Lord's promise of protection. Those,however, who are materially attached are frightened by the prospect of fullsurrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, thereby revealing their inimical mentality toward the Lord.</div>

<div class="First">The perfection of karma-yoga is described here. One who does not desirefruitive rewards for his religious activities does not waste time going to theheavenly planets for celestial sense gratification.

Thus avoiding material rewards andpunishments, such a desireless person can be promoted to the platform of pure devotional service to Lord Kåñëa.</div>

<div class="First">Asmin loke indicates one's present duration of life. Before the death of one'spresent body one can obtain transcendental knowledge or, by great fortune,pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord. The word yadåcchayä indicatesthat if one somehow or other gets the association of pure devotees and hearsfrom them faithfully, one can achieve Kåñëa consciousness, the highestperfection of life. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, throughtranscendental knowledge one obtains liberation, whereas through puredevotional service one can achieve love of Godhead, in which liberation isautomatically included. Both results are certainly superior to ordinary, fruitiveactivities, by which one tries to enjoy much the same things that animals do. Ifone's devotional service is mixed with a tendency toward fruitive activities ormental speculation, then one may achieve the neutral stage of love ofGodhead, whereas those who are inclined to serve only Lord Kåñëa advance tothe higher stages of love of Godhead in servitude, friendship, parental love and the conjugal relationship.</div>

<div class="First">One who has achieved human life on the earth has an excellentopportunity to attain spiritual liberation through Kåñëa consciousness, ordevotional service to the Lord. Thus one should not desire promotion toheaven or risk residence in hell, where excessive enjoyment or punishmentdeviate one's mind from self-realization. On the other hand, one should notthink, "The earth is so nice, I can stay here forever." One should developthorough detachment from all aspects and categories of material existence andgo back home, back to Godhead, where life is eternal and full of bliss and knowledge.</div>
<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa now begins to develop His conclusive proof that actual humanprogress lies beyond material piety and sin. The Lord first clarified that thereare basically three methods of human elevation, namely jïäna, karma andbhakti, and that the goal is transcendental knowledge and ultimately love ofGodhead. Now the Lord explains that promotion to heavenly planets (thefinal goal of piety) as well as residence in hell (the result of sinful activities)are both useless in fulfilling the actual purpose of life. Neither material pietynor sin establish the eternal living entity in his constitutional position;therefore something more is required to achieve the actual perfection of life.</div>

One should then carefully bring the mind back under the control ofthe self. It is stated in Bhagavad-gétä that if one is too austere or too sensuousone cannot control the mind. Sometimes one may bring the mind undercontrol by allowing the material senses limited satisfaction. For example,although one may eat austerely, from time to time one may accept a reasonableamount of mahä-prasädam, opulent foods offered to the temple Deities, so thatthe mind will not become disturbed. Similarly, one may occasionally relax withother transcendentalists through joking, swimming and so forth. But if suchactivities are performed excessively, they will lead to a setback in spiritual life.When the mind desires sinful gratification such as illicit sex or intoxication,one must simply tolerate the mind's foolishness and by strenuous effort pushon with Kåñëa consciousness. Then the waves of illusion will soon subside, and the path of advancement will again open wide.</div>

<div class="Translation"> If, because of momentary inattention, a yogi accidentally commits an abominable activity, then by the very practice of yoga he should burn to ashes the sinful reaction, without at any time employing any other procedure.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The word yogena here indicates jïänena yogena and bhaktyä yogena, sincethese two transcendental systems have the power to burn sinful reactions toashes. It should be clearly understood that the word aàhas, or "sin," here refersto an accidental falldown against one's desire. Premeditated exploitation of the mercy of the Lord can never be excused.</div>
<div class="First">Significantly, the Lord forbids any extraneous purificatory rites, since thetranscendental yoga systems are themselves the most purifying processes,especially bhakti-yoga. If one gives up one's regular prescribed duties to performa special ritual or penance, trying to purify a sinful reaction, then one will beguilty of the additional fault of giving up one's prescribed duties. One shouldpick oneself up from an accidental falldown and go on vigorously with one'sprescribed duties in life without being unnecessarily discouraged. One shouldcertainly lament and feel ashamed, or there will be no purification. However,if one becomes overly depressed at an accidental falldown one will not havethe enthusiasm to go on to perfection. Lord Kåñëa also states in the</div>

<div class="Translation"> It is firmly declared that the steady adherence of transcendentalists to their respective spiritual positions constitutes real piety and that sin occurs when a transcendentalist neglects his prescribed duty. One who adopts this standard of piety and sin, sincerely desiring to give up all past association with sense gratification, is able to subdue materialistic activities, which are by nature impure.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa here explains more clearly that those persons directly engagedin self-realization either through jïäna-yoga or bhakti-yoga need not give uptheir regular duties and perform special penances to atone for an accidentalfalldown. The actual purpose of Vedic literature is to direct one back home,back to Godhead, and not to encourage material sense gratification. Althoughthe Vedas recommend innumerable rituals for promotion to heavenly planetsand enjoyment of all varieties of material opulence, such materialistic rewardsare meant only to engage materialistic people, who otherwise would becomedemoniac. To purify an accidental falldown, one who is engaged intranscendental realization need not adopt any procedure beyond his ownspiritual practice. The words saìgänäà tyäjanecchayä indicate that one shouldnot practice Kåñëa consciousness or self-realization superficially or casually;rather, one should sincerely and earnestly desire freedom from one's past sinfullife. Similarly, the words yä niñöhä indicate that one must constantly practiceKåñëa consciousness. Thus, essential piety is to give up material sensegratification and engage in the loving service of the Lord. One who engageshis senses, mind and intelligence twenty-four hours a day in the Lord's serviceis the most pious person, and the Lord personally protects such a surrendered soul.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Having awakened faith in the narrations of My glories, being disgusted with all material activities, knowing that all sense gratification leads to misery, but still being unable to renounce all sense enjoyment, My devotee should remain happy and worship Me with great faith and conviction. Even though he is sometimes engaged in sense enjoyment, My devotee knows that all sense gratification leads to a miserable result, and he sincerely repents such activities.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The beginning stage of pure devotional service is described here by theLord. A sincere devotee has practically seen that all material activities leadonly to sense gratification and all sense gratification leads only to misery. Thusa devotee's sincere desire is to engage twenty-four hours a day in the lovingservice of Lord Kåñëa without any personal motivation. The devotee sincerelydesires to be established in his constitutional position as the Lord's eternalservitor, and he prays to the Lord to elevate him to this exalted position. Theword anéçvara indicates that because of one's past sinful activities and badhabits one may not immediately be able to completely extinguish the enjoyingspirit. The Lord here encourages such a devotee not to be overly depressed ormorose but to remain enthusiastic and to go on with his loving service. Theword nirviëëa indicates that a sincere devotee, although somewhat entangledin the remnants of sense gratification, is completely disgusted with materiallife and under no circumstances willingly commits sinful activities. In fact, heavoids every kind of materialistic activity. The word kämän basically refers tosex attraction and its by-products in the form of children, home and so forth.Within the material world, the sex impulse is so strong that even a sincerecandidate in the loving service of the Lord may sometimes be disturbed by sexattraction or by lingering sentiments for wife and children. A pure devoteecertainly feels spiritual affection for all living entities, including the so-calledwife and children, but he knows that material bodily attraction leads to nogood, for it simply entangles one and one's so-called relatives in a miserablechain reaction of fruitive activities. The word dåòha-niçcaya ("steadfastconviction") indicates that in any circumstance a devotee is completelydetermined to go on with his prescribed duties for Kåñëa. Thus he thinks, "Bymy previous shameful life my heart is polluted with many illusory attachments.Personally I have no power to stop them. Only Lord Kåñëa within my heartcan remove such inauspicious contamination. But whether the Lord removessuch attachments immediately or lets me go on being afflicted by them, I willnever give up my devotional service to Him. Even if the Lord places millions ofobstacles in my path, and even if because of my offenses I go to hell, I willnever for a moment stop serving Lord Kåñëa. I am not interested in mentalspeculation and fruitive activities; even if Lord Brahmä personally comesbefore me offering such engagements, I will not be even slightly interested.Although I am attached to material things I can see very clearly that they leadto no good because they simply give me trouble and disturb my devotionalservice to the Lord. Therefore, I sincerely repent my foolish attachments to somany material things, and I am patiently awaiting Lord Kåñëa's mercy."The word préta indicates that a devotee feels exactly like the son or subjectof the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is very attached to his relationshipwith the Lord. Therefore, although sincerely lamenting occasional lapses intosense enjoyment, he never gives up his enthusiasm to serve Lord Kåñëa. If adevotee becomes too morose or discouraged in devotional service, he may driftinto an impersonal consciousness or give up his devotional service to the Lord.Therefore, the Lord here advises that although one should sincerely repent, heshould not become chronically depressed. One should understand that becauseof his past sins he must occasionally suffer disturbances from the material mindand senses, but one should not therefore become a devotee of detachment, asdo the speculative philosophers. Although one may desire detachment topurify one's devotional service to the Lord, if one becomes more concernedwith renunciation than with acting for the pleasure of Lord Kåñëa, he ismisunderstanding the position of loving devotional service. Faith in LordKåñëa is so powerful that in due course of time it will automatically awarddetachment and perfect knowledge. If one gives up Lord Kåñëa as the centralobject of one's worship and concentrates more on knowledge and detachment,one will become deviated from one's progress in going back home, back toGodhead. A sincere devotee of the Lord must be sincerely convinced thatsimply by the strength of devotional service and the mercy of Lord Kåñëa hewill achieve everything auspicious in life. One must believe that Lord Kåñëa isall-merciful and that He is the only real goal of one's life. Such determinedfaith combined with a sincere desire to give up sense enjoyment will carry one past the obstacles of this world.</div>
<div class="First">The words jäta-çraddhaù mat-kathäsu are most significant here. By faithfulhearing of the mercy and glories of the Lord one will gradually be freed fromall material desire and clearly see at every moment the utter frustration ofsense gratification. Chanting the glories of the Lord with firm faith andconviction is a tremendously powerful spiritual process that enables one to give up all material association.</div>
<div class="First">There is actually nothing inauspicious in the devotional service of the Lord.Occasional difficulties experienced by a devotee are due to his previousmaterial activities. On the other hand, the endeavor for sense gratification iscompletely inauspicious. Thus sense gratification and devotional service aredirectly opposed to each other. In all circumstances one should thereforeremain the Lord's sincere servant, always believing in His mercy. Then one will certainly go back home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="First">The material senses are engaged in gratifying the concoctions of the mind,causing many types of material desires to become prominent, one afteranother. One who constantly engages in the devotional service of the Lord byhearing and chanting the Lord's transcendental glories with firm faith getsrelief from the harassment of material desires. By serving the Lord onebecomes strengthened in the conviction that Çré Kåñëa is the only actualenjoyer and all others are meant to share the Lord's pleasure throughdevotional service. A devotee of the Lord situates Çré Kåñëa on a beautifulthrone within his heart and there offers the Lord constant service. Just as therising sun gradually eliminates all trace of darkness, the Lord's presence withinthe heart causes all material desires there to weaken and eventually disappear.The words mayi hådi sthite ("when the heart is situated in Me") indicate that anadvanced devotee sees Lord Kåñëa not only within his own heart but withinthe hearts of all living creatures. Thus a sincere devotee who chants and hearsthe glories of Çré Kåñëa should not be discouraged by the remnants of materialdesires within the heart. He should faithfully wait for the devotional process to naturally purify the heart of all contamination.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The knot in the heart is pierced, all misgivings are cut to pieces and the chain of fruitive actions is terminated when I am seen as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Hådaya-granthi indicates that one's heart is bound to illusion by falseidentification with the material body. One thus becomes absorbed in materialsex pleasure, dreaming of innumerable combinations of male and femalebodies. A person intoxicated by sex attraction cannot understand that theSupreme Personality of Godhead is the reservoir of all pleasure and thesupreme enjoyer. When a devotee achieves steadiness in devotional service,feeling transcendental pleasure at every moment in the execution of his lovingservice to the Lord, the knot of false identification is pierced and all hismisgivings are cut to pieces. In illusion we imagine that the living entitycannot be fully satisfied without material sense gratification and speculativedoubting of the Absolute Truth. Materialistic persons consider senseenjoyment and speculative doubting to be essential for civilized life. A puredevotee, however, realizes that Lord Kåñëa is an unlimited ocean of happinessand the personification of all knowledge. This realization of Lord Kåñëacompletely eradicates the twin tendencies of sense gratification and mentalspeculation. Thus the chain of fruitive activities, or karma, automaticallycollapses, just as a fire collapses and goes out when its fuel is removed.Advanced devotional service automatically awards one liberation frommaterial bondage, as confirmed by Lord Kapila: jarayaty äçu yä koçaà nigérëamanalo yathä. "Bhakti, devotional service, dissolves the subtle body of the livingentity without separate effort, just as fire in the stomach digests all that weeat." (SB 3.25.33) Çréla Prabhupäda states in his purport to this verse, "Adevotee does not have to try separately to attain liberation. That very serviceto the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the process of liberation, because toengage oneself in the service of the Lord is to liberate oneself from materialentanglement. Çré Bilvamaìgala Öhäkura explained this position very nicely.He said, 'If I have unflinching devotion unto the lotus feet of the SupremeLord, then mukti, or liberation, serves me as my maidservant. Mukti themaidservant is always ready to do whatever I ask.' For a devotee, liberation isno problem at all. Liberation takes place without separate endeavor."</div>

<div class="Translation"> Therefore, for a devotee engaged in My loving service, with mind fixed on Me, the cultivation of knowledge and renunciation is generally not the means of achieving the highest perfection within this world.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">A surrendered devotee of Lord Kåñëa does not seek perfection through thecultivation of knowledge and renunciation outside the loving service of theLord. Devotional service to Lord Kåñëa, being itself the supremetranscendental process, never depends upon the secondary methods involvingthe cultivation of knowledge and renunciation. By chanting and hearing theglories of the Personality of Godhead a devotee automatically realizes allknowledge, and as the devotee's attachment to the Lord increases, heautomatically gives up attachment for the inferior material nature. The Lordhas explicitly declared in the previous verses that a devotee should not try tosolve his lingering problems by means other than devotional service. Althougha sincere devotee has surrendered heart and soul in loving service to the Lord,there may be lingering material attachments that prevent the devotee fromperfectly realizing transcendental knowledge. Devotional service, however,will automatically eradicate such lingering attachments in due course of time.If the devotee tries to purify himself through cultivation of knowledge andrenunciation, which fall outside the scope of devotional service, there isdanger of his being deviated from the Lord's lotus feet and falling downcompletely from the transcendental path. One who endeavors for purificationoutside the loving service of the Lord has not actually understood thetranscendental potency of bhakti-yoga and does not appreciate the extent of Lord Kåñëa's mercy.</div>
<div class="First">Within this world one's heart is bound by sex attraction, which disturbsone's meditation on the lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa. Intoxicated by contact withwomen, the conditioned soul becomes artificially proud and forgets his lovingservitude to the Lord. Through determined cultivation of knowledge anddetachment, a conditioned soul may try to purify himself without the mercy ofLord Kåñëa, but such false pride is to be given up, just as one must give up thefalse pride of material attraction. When pure devotional service to the Lord isavailable to a conditioned soul, attraction to other processes is certainly adeviation in his devotional career. Material desire stubbornly residing withinthe heart can be vanquished by taking full shelter of the Supreme Personalityof Godhead. Without false confidence in one's own cultivation of knowledgeand renunciation, one should depend fully on the mercy of Lord Kåñëa and atthe same time strictly follow the rules and regulations of bhakti-yoga, as instructed by the Lord Himself.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa here reveals the transcendental glories of devotional service tothe Lord. Although pure devotees are desireless, desiring only the Lord'sservice, sometimes a great devotee may desire the Lord's benediction tofacilitate his loving service. In the Sixth Canto of the Bhägavatam we find thatÇré Citraketu, a great devotee of the Lord, desired promotion to heaven so thataccompanied by the most attractive ladies of the Vidyädhara planet he couldbeautifully chant the glories of the Lord. Similarly, Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé, thegreat narrator of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, desiring to avoid entanglement in theillusory potency of the Lord, would not come out of his mother's womb. Inother words, Çukadeva Gosvämé desired apavargam, or liberation from mäyä, sothat his devotional service would not be disturbed. Lord Kåñëa personally sentthe illusory energy far away so that Çukadeva Gosvämé would come out of hismother's womb. Because of intense loving desire to serve the lotus feet of theLord, a devotee may also desire promotion to the spiritual world.According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, a devotee, having givenup the independent cultivation of knowledge and detachment, may have firmfaith in the devotional service of the Lord and yet remain slightly attached tothe fruits of such activities. By expert fruitive activities one gains residence inmaterial heaven, and by cultivation of detachment one is relieved of all bodilydistress. If Lord Kåñëa detects within a devotee's heart the desire for suchbenedictions, the Lord can easily award them to His devotee.The word itaraiù in this verse indicates visiting holy places, acceptingreligious vows and so forth. Several auspicious processes of elevation arementioned in the verse preceding this, but all the auspicious results of theseprocesses are easily achieved by loving service to the Lord. Thus all devotees ofthe Lord, in whatever stage of advancement, should dedicate their energyexclusively to the Lord's service, as affirmed in the Second Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam by Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé:</div>

One who chants LordKåñëa's holy name or superficially serves the Lord with the motive of achievingimpersonal liberation or material sense gratification cannot be considered atranscendental devotee of the Lord. As long as one desires mundanereligiosity, economic development, sense gratification or liberation, onecannot achieve the platform of samädhi, or perfect self-realization. Everyliving entity is actually the eternal servant of Lord Kåñëa and isconstitutionally meant to engage in the loving service of the Lord withoutpersonal desire.

ÇrélaPrabhupäda remarks in this regard, "As the unmixed sun ray is very forcefuland is therefore called tévra, similarly, unmixed bhakti-yoga of hearing,chanting, etc., may be performed by one and all regardless of inner motive."Undoubtedly, in this age of Kali people are generally very fallen and pollutedby material lust, greed, anger, lamentation and so forth. In this age most peopleare sarva-käma, or full of material desires. Still we must understand that simplyby taking shelter of Lord Kåñëa we will achieve everything in life. The livingentity should not engage in any process except the loving service of the Lord.One must accept that Lord Kåñëa is the reservoir of all pleasure and that onlyLord Kåñëa within our heart can fulfill our real desire. This simple faith thatone will achieve everything by approaching Lord Kåñëa is the essence of allknowledge and carries even a fallen person over the painful hurdles of this difficult age.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The words buddheù param indicate that the material modes of naturecannot be found within a pure devotee absorbed in the transcendentalqualities of the Lord. In the Second Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä, Lord Kåñëaclearly explains that a pure devotee is recognized by complete detachmentfrom personal desire; therefore, a pure devotee constantly engaged in selflessservice to Lord Kåñëa may not always observe the innumerable details of Vedicrituals and regulations. Such occasional negligence is not to be considered atransgression. Similarly, observance of ordinary material piety does notconstitute the ultimate qualification of a soul surrendered to God. Love ofKåñëa and absolute surrender to the Lord's will raise one immediately to thetranscendental platform, where activities performed on the Lord's behalf areabsolute, being an expression of God's will. Ordinary materialistic personssometimes falsely claim this exalted status for their whimsical, immoralactivities and cause a great disturbance in society. However, just as an ordinaryperson should not falsely claim the executive privileges of the personalassistants of a national leader, similarly, an ordinary conditioned soul may notfoolishly claim that his immoral, whimsical or speculative activities aresheltered by divine right, being the will of God. One must actually be a puredevotee of the Lord, empowered by the Lord Himself and completelysurrendered to the will of the Lord, before one may be accepted as transcendental to ordinary piety and sin.</div>

<div class="First">A momentary falldown by a sincere devotee of the Lord cannot change theLord's feelings toward such a person. Even an ordinary father or motherquickly excuses a momentary transgression by their child. Just as children andparents enjoy mutual love, the Lord's surrendered servants enjoy a lovingrelationship with the Lord. An unpremeditated, accidental falldown is quicklyexcused by the Lord, and all members of society must share in the Lord's ownfeelings, excusing such a sincere devotee. An advanced devotee should not bebranded as materialistic or sinful because of accidental falldown. A devoteeimmediately returns to the platform of saintly service and begs the Lord'sforgiveness. However, one who permanently remains in a fallen condition canno longer be accepted as a highly elevated devotee of the Lord.</div>

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Twentieth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Pure Devotional Service Surpasses Knowledge and Detachment."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">21. Lord Kåñëa's Explanation of the Vedic Path</div>
<div class="First">There are persons who are unfit for all three of the forms of yoga-karma,jïäna and bhakti. They are inimical to Lord Kåñëa, attached to sensegratification, and are dominated by fruitive activities aimed at fulfillment ofmaterial desires. This chapter describes their faults in terms of place, time, substance and beneficiary of actions.</div>
<div class="First">For those who are perfect in knowledge and devotion to the Lord, there areno materially good qualities or faults. But for a candidate endeavoring on theplatform of karma to achieve cessation of material life, execution of regularand special fruitive duties is good and the failure to execute such is evil. Thatwhich counteracts sinful reaction is also good for him.For one on the platform of knowledge in the pure mode of goodness and forone on the platform of devotion, the proper actions are, respectively,cultivation of knowledge and practice of devotional service consisting ofhearing, chanting and so forth. For both, everything detrimental to theirproper actions is bad. But for persons who are not candidates fortranscendental advancement or who are not perfected souls, namely those whoare completely inimical to spiritual life and are devoted exclusively to fruitivework for fulfillment of lusty desires, there are numerous considerations ofpurity and impurity and auspiciousness and inauspiciousness. These are to bemade in terms of one's body, the place of activity, the time, the objects utilized,the performer, the mantras chanted and the particular activity.In actuality, virtue and fault are not absolute but are relative to one'sparticular platform of advancement. Remaining fixed in the type ofdiscrimination suitable to one's level of advancement is good, and anythingelse is bad. This is the basic understanding of virtue and fault. Even amongobjects belonging to the same category, there are different considerations oftheir purity or impurity in relation to performance of religious duties, worldlytransactions, and the maintenance of one's life. These distinctions are described in various scriptures.</div>
<div class="First">The doctrine of varëäçrama codifies precepts of bodily purity and impurity.With respect to place, purity and impurity are distinguished by such facts asthe presence of black deer. In connection with time, there are distinctions ofpurity and impurity either in terms of the time itself or in terms of its specificrelation with various objects. In connection with physical substances,distinctions of purity and impurity are made in terms of sanctification ofobjects and words and by such activities as bathing, giving charity, performingaustere penances and remembering the Supreme Lord. There are alsodistinctions of the purity and impurity of the performers of actions. Whenone's knowledge of mantras is received from the lips of the bona fide spiritualmaster, one's mantra is considered pure, and one's work is purified by offeringit unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If the six factors of place, timeand so forth are purified, then there is dharma, or virtue, but otherwise there is adharma, or fault.</div>
<div class="First">Ultimately, there is no substantial basis in distinctions of virtue and fault,because they transform according to place, time, beneficiary and so on. Inregard to the execution of prescribed duties for sense gratification, the actualintent of all the scriptures is the subduing of materialistic propensities; such isthe actual principle of religion that destroys sorrow, confusion and fear andbestows all good fortune. Work performed for sense gratification is not actuallybeneficial. The descriptions of such fruitive benefits offered in variousphala-çrutis are actually meant to help one gradually cultivate a taste for thehighest benefit. But persons of inferior intelligence take the flowerybenedictory verses of the scriptures to be the actual purport of the Vedas; thisopinion, however, is never held by those in factual knowledge of the truth ofthe Vedas. Persons whose minds are agitated by the flowery words of the Vedashave no attraction for hearing topics about Lord Hari. It should be understoodthat there is no inner purport to the Vedas apart from the original Personalityof Godhead. The Vedas focus exclusively upon the Supreme Absolute Truth,the Personality of Godhead. Because this material world is simply the illusoryenergy of the Supreme Lord, it is by refuting material existence that one gains disassociation from matter.</div>

<div class="First">As clearly explained by Lord Kåñëa in the previous chapters, philosophicalanalysis and also the performance of prescribed duties are ultimately meant forachieving Kåñëa consciousness, or pure love of God. Devotional service, basedon hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord, directly engages theconditioned soul in the Lord's loving service and thus is the most efficientmeans of achieving the Lord. All three processes, however, share a commongoal, Kåñëa consciousness. Now the Lord describes those who, beingcompletely absorbed in material sense gratification, do not adopt anyauthorized means to achieve the Lord's mercy. Currently, hundreds of millionsof unfortunate human beings fit squarely into this category and, as describedhere, perpetually suffer the bondage of material existence.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the previous verse Lord Kåñëa explained that the path of spiritualprogress begins with working without fruitive desires, advances to the stage ofrealized spiritual knowledge, and culminates in direct engagement in thedevotional service of the Lord. Here the Lord emphasizes that a conditionedsoul should not artificially disrupt the natural evolution of his Kåñëaconsciousness by deviating from those duties prescribed by the Lord Himself.In the lower stages of human life one is entangled in false identification withthe gross material body and desires to execute material fruitive activities basedon society, friendship and love. When such materialistic activities are offeredin sacrifice to the Supreme Lord, one becomes situated in karma-yoga. Byregulated sacrifice one gradually gives up the gross bodily concept of life andadvances to the stage of realization of spiritual knowledge, whereby oneunderstands oneself to be an eternal spirit soul completely different from thematerial body and mind. Feeling relief from the pangs of materialism onebecomes very attached to one's spiritual knowledge, and thus one is situated inthe stage of jïäna-yoga. As the candidate further advances on the spiritualpath, he understands himself to be part and parcel of the Supreme Soul, thePersonality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa. He then sees that his conditional life aswell as his spiritual knowledge was obtained from the Personality of Godhead,who awards the results of all types of activities, both pious and sinful. Bydirectly engaging in the loving service of the Supreme Lord and understandingoneself to be the Lord's eternal servant, one's attachment evolves into purelove of Godhead. Thus one first gives up the lower stage of attachment to thematerial body and then subsequently gives up attachment to cultivation ofspiritual knowledge. This relieves one of material life. Finally one recognizesthe Lord Himself as the resting place of one's eternal love and fully surrenders to God in full Kåñëa consciousness.</div>
<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa explains in this verse that one who is still attached to thematerial body and mind cannot artificially give up the prescribed duties ofkarma-yoga. In the same way, one who is a spiritual neophyte, just beginning torealize the illusion of material life, should not artificially try to think of theLord's intimate pastimes twenty-four hours a day, imitating the stage ofprema-bhakti. Rather, he should cultivate analytic knowledge of the materialworld, by which one gives up attachment to the material body and mind. InÇrémad-Bhägavatam we find many analytic descriptions of the material world,and they can free the conditioned soul from false identification with matter.One who has achieved the perfect stage of love of Godhead, however, beingfreed from all gross and subtle attachments to the material world, may give upthe lower stages of karma-yoga and jïäna-yoga and engage directly in the Lord's loving service.</div>
<div class="First">In Chapter Nineteen, verse 45, Lord Kåñëa states, guëa-doña-dåçir doñoguëas tübhaya-varjitaù. One should not see material good and evil within adevotee of the Lord. Indeed, one becomes pious by giving up such mundaneconceptions. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura points out that occasionallya neophyte devotee may be polluted by association with those enthusiasticallyexecuting fruitive activities and mental speculation. Such a devotee's religiousactivities may be affected by mundane tendencies. Similarly, an ordinaryperson who observes the exalted status of a pure devotee sometimes externallyimitates the devotee's activities, considering himself to be on the same exaltedplatform of pure devotional service. These imperfect practitioners ofbhakti-yoga are not exempt from criticism, since their fruitive activities,mental speculation and false prestige are material intrusions in the pure lovingservice of the Lord. A pure devotee engaged exclusively in the Lord's serviceshould not be criticized, but a devotee whose devotional service is mixed withmaterial qualities may be corrected so that he can rise to the platform of puredevotional service. Innocent persons should not be misled by the mixeddevotional service of those not engaged exclusively in the bhakti-yoga system,but those unable to fully engage in Kåñëa consciousness should neverthelessnot give up their regular prescribed duties, declaring them to be illusion. Forexample, one unable to fully engage in pure Kåñëa consciousness should notgive up his family, considering it an illusion, for by doing so he will fall intoillicit sex life. Material piety and analytic knowledge of the material worldmust therefore be cultivated until one comes to the stage of directly practicing Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> O sinless Uddhava, in order to understand what is proper in life one must evaluate a given object within its particular category. Thus, in analyzing religious principles one must consider purity and impurity. Similarly, in one's ordinary dealings one must distinguish between good and bad, and to insure one's physical survival one must recognize that which is auspicious and inauspicious.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In religious activities, ordinary dealings and personal survival one cannotavoid value judgements. Morality and religion are perennial necessities incivilized society; therefore distinctions between purity and impurity, piety andimpiety, morality and immorality must somehow be ascertained. Similarly, inour ordinary, worldly activities we distinguish between palatable and tastelessfood, good and bad business, high-class and low-class residences, good and badfriends, and so forth. And to insure our physical health and survival, we mustconstantly distinguish between what is safe and unsafe, healthy and unhealthy,profitable and unprofitable. Even a learned person must constantly distinguishbetween good and bad within the material world, but at the same time he mustunderstand the transcendental position of Kåñëa consciousness. Despite one'scareful calculation of that which is materially healthy and unhealthy, thephysical body will collapse and die. Despite careful scrutiny of the sociallyfavorable and unfavorable, one's entire social milieu will vanish with thepassing of time. In the same way, great religions arise and disappear in thecourse of history. Thus mere religiosity, social and financial expertise orphysical fitness cannot award the actual perfection of life. There is atranscendental good beyond the relative good of the material world. Any saneperson accepts the practical and immediate necessity of materialdiscrimination; yet one must come ultimately to the transcendental stage ofKåñëa consciousness, where life is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge. LordKåñëa, in His elaborate teachings to Çré Uddhava, is gradually clarifying thetranscendental position of Kåñëa consciousness beyond the endless variety of material good and evil.</div>

<div class="First">Ordinary religious principles, prescribing innumerable rules, regulationsand prohibitions, are undoubtedly a great burden for those bereft of Kåñëaconsciousness. In the First Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.1.11) it is stated,bhüréëi bhüri-karmäëi çrotavyäni vibhägaçaù: there are countless religiousscriptures in the world prescribing countless religious duties. The authorizedscriptures are those spoken by the Lord Himself or His representatives, asstated in this verse. In the last chapter of Bhagavad-gétä (18.66) Lord Kåñëastates, sarva-dharmän parityajya mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja: [Bg. 18.66] oneshould give up the troublesome burden of mundane piety and directly take tothe loving service of the Lord, in which everything is simplified. Lord Kåñëaalso states in Bhagavad-gétä (9.2), su-sukham kartum avyayam: the bhakti-yogaprocess, which depends completely upon the mercy of the Lord, is very joyfuland easily performed. Similarly, Locana däsa Öhäkura sings,</div>

<div class="First">Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, who is Lord Kåñëa Himself, appeared five hundredyears ago to distribute the sublime method of chanting the holy names of theLord. In this way, rather than bearing the burden of artificial austerity, onecan directly take to the Lord's service, cleansing one's heart and immediatelyexperiencing transcendental bliss. Those who have taken to CaitanyaMahäprabhu's movement follow four basic principles: no illicit sex, no eatingof meat, fish or eggs, no intoxication and no gambling. They rise early in themorning, chant Hare Kåñëa and spend the day happily engaged in the Lord'sservice. Those who follow the ritualistic karma-käëòa section of the Vedas,however, are burdened with innumerable regulations, rituals and ceremonies,which must be personally performed by the worshipers or performed on theirbehalf by qualified brähmaëas. At any moment there is danger of discrepancyresulting in the total loss of their accumulated piety. Similarly, those on thephilosophical path must painstakingly define, refine and adjust philosophicalcategories, a process that generally ends in confusion and hopelessness. Thepractitioners of mystic yoga undergo grueling penances, subjecting themselvesto severe heat and cold, near starvation and so on. All such materialisticpersons have personal desires to fulfill, whereas the devotees of the Lord, whodesire the Lord's pleasure, simply depend upon the Lord's mercy and go backhome, back to Godhead. In the previous verse the Lord mentioned that in thematerial world there are endless distinctions and value judgements to be madein the course of one's life. A devotee, however, sees Kåñëa within everythingand everything within Kåñëa, remaining humble, simple and blissful in theLord's service. He does not perform elaborate religious ceremonies, nor does hebecome antisocial or immoral. The devotee simply chants the holy name ofKåñëa and easily achieves the highest perfection of life. Ordinary personsendeavor for bodily maintenance, but a devotee is automatically maintained bythe Lord's mercy. A devotee's ordinary dealings and religious activities are alsoall dedicated to the Personality of Godhead; thus there is nothing but Kåñëa ina devotee's life. Kåñëa gives all protection and maintenance, and the devoteegives everything to Kåñëa. This natural liberated situation is called Kåñëaconsciousness. It is the ultimate absolute good, as explained by the Lord throughout this canto.</div>

<div class="First">All material bodies are composed of different proportions of the same fivegross elements, which emanate from the one Personality of Godhead and coverthe living entities, who are all in the jéva category.The concepts of good and bad depend on the choice of the Supreme Lordand not on inherent qualitative differences in material objects. A Kåñëaconscious person ultimately sees all material phenomena as one. The devotee'sgood behavior, intelligent discrimination and artistic sense within the materialworld are all based on the will of God. The material elements, beingemanations from the Supreme Lord, are ultimately all nondifferent. However,advocates of mundane piety fear that if the material duality of good and bad isminimized, people will become immoral or anarchistic. Certainly theimpersonal and atheistic philosophy preached by modern scientists, in whichmaterial variety is reduced to mere mathematical descriptions of molecular andatomic particles, leads to immoral society. Although both material science andVedic knowledge uncover the illusion of material variety and reveal theultimate oneness of all material energy, only the devotees of Lord Kåñëa aresurrendered to the supreme absolute piety of God's will. Thus they always actfor the benefit of all living entities, accepting material variety in the Lord'sservice, according to the Lord's desire. Without Kåñëa consciousness, or Godconsciousness, people cannot understand the absolute position of spiritualgoodness; instead they artificially try to construct a civilization based oninterdependent self-interest on the material platform. Such a foolisharrangement easily collapses, as evidenced by widespread social conflict andchaos in the modern age. All members of a civilized society must accept theabsolute authority of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and then socialpeace and harmony will not rest on the flimsy relative platform of mundane piety and sin.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The words näma-rüpäëi viñamäëi refer to the system of varëäçrama-dharma,in which members of human society are designated according to four socialand four occupational divisions. Those dedicated to intellectual or religiousperfection are called brähmaëas, those dedicated to political perfection arecalled kñatriyas, those dedicated to financial perfection are called vaiçyas, andthose dedicated to eating, sleeping, sex and honest work are called çüdras. Suchpropensities arise from the three modes of material nature (goodness, passionand ignorance), because the pure soul is not materially intellectual, ambitiousfor power, enterprising or servile. Rather, the pure soul is always absorbed inloving devotion to the Supreme Lord. If the various propensities of aconditioned soul are not engaged in the varëäçrama system, they will certainlybe misused, and thus that person will fall down from the standard of humanlife. The Vedic system is designed by the Lord so that conditioned souls maypursue their individual achievements and at the same time advance toward theultimate goal of life, Kåñëa consciousness. Just as a doctor deals with a crazyman by speaking to him sympathetically in terms of his false conception of life,one who understands the Vedic literature engages the living entities accordingto their illusory identification with the elements of matter. Although allmaterial bodies are composed of the same material elements and are thusqualitatively identical, as described here by the word sameñu, the Vedic socialsystem, varëäçrama, is created to engage all human beings in Kåñëaconsciousness according to their various degrees of material identification.The absolute good is the Supreme Lord Himself, and that which approachesthe Supreme Lord becomes similarly good. Because the sun is the source ofheat within this world, an object that approaches the sun becomes hotter andhotter until it merges into fire. In the same manner, as we approach thetranscendental nature of the Personality of Godhead, we automaticallybecome surcharged with absolute goodness. Although this knowledge is thereal basis of the Vedic literature, mundane piety is enjoined and sin isprohibited so that one can gradually come to the platform of materialgoodness, whereupon spiritual knowledge becomes visible.</div>

<div class="First">The word niyamärtham ("in order to restrict") is significant in this verse. Aconditioned soul falsely identifies with his material senses and thus considersanything giving immediate satisfaction to the body to be good and anythinginconvenient or disturbing to be bad. By higher intelligence, however, onerecognizes long-term self-interest and danger. For example, medicine may beimmediately bitter, but by calculating one's long-term interest one accepts thebitter medicine to cure a disease that is not immediately troublesome butultimately fatal. Similarly, Vedic literature restricts the sinful propensities ofhuman beings by establishing what is proper and what is improper among allthe objects and activities of the material world. Because everyone must eat, theVedas prescribe foods in the mode of goodness and not those which are sinful,such as meat, fish and eggs. Similarly, one is advised to live in a peaceful andpious community and not in association with sinful persons, nor in an uncleanor turbulent environment. By designating and restricting the exploitation ofthe material world, Vedic knowledge gradually brings a conditioned soul to theplatform of material goodness. At that stage one becomes eligible to serve theSupreme Personality of Godhead and enter the transcendental stage of life. Itshould be remembered that such mere eligibility does not constitute actualqualification; without Kåñëa consciousness mere mundane piety can neverqualify a conditioned soul to go back home, back to Godhead. Within thisworld we are all infected by false pride, which must be diminished throughsubmission to the Vedic injunctions. One who is completely engaged in theloving service of the Lord need not adopt these preliminary methods, for hedirectly contacts the Personality of Godhead through the spontaneous processof surrender. In the previous verse the Lord explained why Vedic literaturesassign different values to the bodies of different living entities, and here theLord explains the Vedic value system in regard to the material objects that interact with these bodies.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Among places, those bereft of the spotted antelope, those devoid of devotion to the brähmaëas, those possessing spotted antelopes but bereft of respectable men, provinces like Kékaöa and places where cleanliness and purificatory rites are neglected, where meat-eaters are prominent or where the earth is barren, are all considered to be contaminated lands.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The word kåñëa-sära refers to the spotted antelope, whose hide is used bybrahmacärés while residing in the äçrama of the spiritual master. Brahmacärésnever hunt in the forest, but rather accept skins from those animals alreadydeceased. The skin of the black or spotted antelope is also used as a garment bythose receiving instruction in the execution of Vedic sacrifice. Therefore,since sacrifice cannot be properly performed in areas bereft of such creatures,these places are impure. Furthermore, although the inhabitants of a particularplace may be expert in performing fruitive activities and ritualistic sacrifices, ifthey are inimical to the devotional service of the Lord, such a place is alsopolluted. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura explains that previously theprovinces of Bihar and Bengal were bereft of devotional service to the Lordand were considered impure. Then great Vaiñëavas such as Jayadeva appearedin these territories, converting them into holy places.The word asauvéra indicates those places without suvéras, respectable saintlypersons. Ordinarily, a person who obeys the state laws is considered arespectable citizen. In the same way, one who strictly obeys the law of God isconsidered to be a cultured or decent man, suvéra. The place where suchintelligent persons reside is called sauvéram. Kékaöa refers to the modern stateof Bihar, which traditionally has been known as a territory of uncivilized men.Even in such provinces, however, any place where saintly persons gather isconsidered to be holy. On the other hand, a province of generally respectablepersons is immediately polluted by the presence of sinful men. Asaàskåtaindicates lack of external cleanliness, as well as the absence of purificatoryceremonies for internal cleanliness. Çréla Madhväcärya quotes from theSkanda Puräëa as follows: "Religious persons should reside within aneight-mile radius of rivers, oceans, mountains, hermitages, forests, spiritualcities or places where the çälagräma-çélä is found. All other places should beconsidered kékaöa, or contaminated. But if even in such contaminated placesblack and spotted antelopes are found, one may reside there as long as sinfulpersons are not also present. Even if sinful persons are present, if the civilpower rests with respectable authorities, one may remain. Similarly, one maydwell wherever the Deity of Viñëu is duly installed and worshiped."The Lord here elaborates upon the theme of piety and sin, which are basedon purity and impurity. Thus pure and contaminated places of residence are described here.</div>

<div class="First">Having discussed pure and impure places, the Lord now discusses differentqualities of time. Certain times, such as the brähma-muhürta, the last fewhours before sunrise, are always auspicious for spiritual advancement. Othertimes, not auspicious in themselves, become so by achievement of material prosperity that facilitates one's mission in life.</div>
<div class="First">Political, social or economic disturbances that obstruct the execution ofone's religious duties are considered inauspicious times. Similarly, a woman isconsidered contaminated just after childbirth or during her menstrual period.She cannot perform ordinary religious activities at such times, which aretherefore inauspicious and impure. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkuraexplains that the most auspicious of all times is the moment one achieves themercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one neglects the lovingservice of the Lord, being carried away by sense gratification, he is certainlyliving in most inauspicious times. Therefore that moment in which oneachieves the association of the Supreme Lord or the Lord's pure devotee is themost auspicious time, whereas the moment of losing such association is mostinauspicious. In other words, the perfection of life is simply Kåñëaconsciousness, by which one transcends the dualities of time and space caused by the three modes of material nature.</div>

<div class="First">Cloth is purified by application of clean water and contaminated byapplication of urine. The words of a saintly brähmaëa are pure, but the soundvibration of a materialistic person is contaminated by lust and envy. A saintlydevotee explains actual purity to others, whereas a nondevotee makes falsepropaganda that leads innocent people to commit polluted, sinful activities.Pure rituals are those meant for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, whilematerialistic ceremonies are those that lead their followers into materialisticand demoniac activities. The word saàskäreëa also indicates that the purity orimpurity of a particular object is ascertained according to the regulations ofritualistic performances. For example, a flower to be offered to the Deity mustbe purified with water. Flowers or food cannot be offered to the Deity,however, if they have been contaminated by being smelled or tasted before theoffering. The word kälena indicates that certain substances are purified bytime and others contaminated by time. Rainwater, for example, is consideredpure after ten days' time, and after three days in cases of emergency. On theother hand, certain foods decay in time and thus become impure. Mahatvaindicates that great bodies of water do not become contaminated, and alpatayämeans that a small amount of water can easily become polluted or stagnant. Inthe same way, a great soul is not polluted by occasional contact withmaterialistic persons, whereas one whose devotion to God is very small is easilycarried away and put into doubt by bad association. In terms of combinationwith other substances, and in terms of speech, ritual, time and magnitude, thepurity and impurity of all objects can be ascertained.Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura remarks that impure or decayed foodis certainly forbidden for normal persons but is permissible for those who have no other means of subsistence.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Lord has described the purity and impurity of different places, timesand material objects. According to the laws of nature, that which is impurecontaminates a particular person in accordance with that person's situation, asdescribed here. For example, on certain occasions, such as a solar eclipse or justafter childbirth, one must restrict the intake of food according to ritualisticinjunctions. One who is physically weak, however, may eat without beingconsidered impious. Ordinary persons consider the ten days followingchildbirth to be most auspicious, whereas one who is learned knows that thisperiod is actually impure. Ignorance of the law does not save one from beingpunished, but one who consciously commits sinful activities is considered mostfallen. Concerning opulence (samåddhi), worn-out, dirty clothing or a messyresidence are considered impure for a rich man but acceptable for one who ispoor. The word deça indicates that in a safe and peaceful place one is obligatedto strictly perform religious rituals, whereas in a dangerous or chaotic situationone may be excused for occasional negligence of secondary principles. Onewho is physically healthy must offer obeisances to the Deities, attend religiousfunctions and execute his prescribed duties, but a young child or sickly personmay be excused from such activities, as indicated by the word avasthä.</div>

<div class="First">The word avasthä indicates that when boys and girls are young they arekept pure by youthful innocence and that as they grow up they are kept purethrough proper education and engagement. By one's individual potency oneshould avoid sinful activities and the association of those inclined towardsense gratification. The word karma here refers to prescribed duties, such asworshiping the spiritual master and the Deity, chanting the Gäyatré mantrathree times daily and accepting spiritual initiation. The prescribed duties ofthe varëäçrama system automatically purify one from the covering of false egoby dovetailing one's bodily designation in appropriate religious activities.There are specific duties for brähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas, çüdras, brahmacärés,gåhasthas, vänaprasthas and sannyäsés, as described previously in this canto bythe Lord Himself. The most significant word here is mat-småtyä ("byremembrance of Me"). Ultimately, one cannot avoid the infection of illusionthrough any process except Kåñëa consciousness. The three modes of natureperpetually interact, and one must sometimes fall into the mode of ignoranceand sometimes rise to the mode of goodness, uselessly rotating within thekingdom of illusion. But by Kåñëa consciousness, remembrance of thePersonality of Godhead, one can actually uproot one's tendency to act againstthe will of the Absolute Truth. Then one becomes freed from the clutches ofmäyä and goes back home, back to Godhead. As stated in the Garuòa Puräëa,</div>

<div class="First">The Lord clearly explains here that material piety and sin are alwaysrelative considerations. For example, if a neighbor's house is on fire and onechops a hole in the roof so that the trapped family may escape, one isconsidered to be a pious hero because of the dangerous condition. In normalconditions, however, if one chops a hole in his neighbor's roof or breaks theneighbor's windows, he is considered a criminal. Similarly, one who abandonsone's wife and children is certainly irresponsible and thoughtless. If one takessannyäsa, however, and remains fixed on a higher spiritual platform, he isconsidered to be a most saintly person. Piety and sin therefore depend uponparticular circumstances and are at times difficult to distinguish.According to Çréla Madhväcärya, persons above the age of fourteen areconsidered capable of distinguishing between good and bad and are thusresponsible for their pious and sinful activities. Animals, on the other hand,being merged in ignorance, cannot be blamed for their offenses or praised fortheir so-called good qualities, which all arise ultimately from ignorance.Human beings who act like animals, with the idea that one should not feel anyguilt but should do whatever one likes, will certainly take birth as animalsabsorbed in ignorance. And there are other foolish people who, observing therelativity of material piety and sin, conclude that there is no absolute good. Itshould be understood, however, that Kåñëa consciousness is absolutely goodbecause it involves complete obedience to the Absolute Truth, the SupremePersonality of Godhead, whose goodness is eternal and absolute. Those whoare inclined to study material piety and sin ultimately experience frustrationdue to the relativity and variability of the subject matter. One shouldtherefore come to the transcendental platform of Kåñëa consciousness, which is valid and perfect in all circumstances.</div>

Similarly, a brähmaëa who drinks liquor is considered to becommitting a most abominable act, whereas a çüdra, a low-class man, who canmoderate his drinking is considered to be self-controlled. Piety and sin on thematerial level are thus relative considerations. Any member of society,however, who receives dékñä, initiation into the chanting of the Lord's holynames, must strictly obey the four regulative principles: no eating of meat, fishor eggs, no illicit sex, no intoxication and no gambling. A spiritually initiatedperson neglecting these principles will certainly fall from his elevated position of liberation.</div>

<div class="Translation"> One who accepts material sense objects as desirable certainly becomes attached to them. From such attachment lust arises, and this lust creates quarrel among men.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The actual goal of human life should not be material sense gratification, forit is the basis of conflict in human society. Although the Vedic literaturesometimes sanctions sense gratification, the ultimate purpose of the Vedas isrenunciation, since Vedic culture cannot possibly recommend anything thatdisturbs human life. A lusty person is easily angered and becomes inimical toanyone frustrating his lusty desires. Since his sex desire can never be satisfied,a lusty person ultimately becomes frustrated with his own sex partner, and thusa "love-hate" relationship develops. A lusty person considers himself to be theenjoyer of God's creation and is therefore full of pride and false prestige. Thelusty, proud person will not be attracted to the process of humble submission atthe lotus feet of the bona fide spiritual master. Attraction to illicit sex is thusthe direct enemy of Kåñëa consciousness, which depends upon humblesubmission to the representative of the Supreme Lord. Lord Kåñëa also statesin Bhagavad-gétä that desire for illicit sex is the all-devouring, sinful enemy of this world.</div>
<div class="First">Because modern society sanctions unrestricted mixing of men and women,its citizens cannot possibly achieve peace; rather, the regulation of conflictbecomes the basis of social survival. This is the symptom of an ignorant societyfalsely accepting the material body as the highest good, as described here bythe words viñayeñu guëädhyäsät. One who is too affectionate to his own body will inevitably be seized by sex desire.</div>

<div class="First">The desire for material association arises from one's propensity to deny thateverything is God's energy. Falsely imagining material sense objects to beseparate from the Supreme Lord, one desires to enjoy them; such desire givesrise to conflict and quarrel in human society. This conflict inevitably gives riseto great anger, which makes human beings become foolish and destructive.Thus the actual goal of human life is quickly forgotten.</div>

<div class="First">Kåñëa consciousness is so vital and essential that one who has deviated fromthis progressive path of self-realization is considered to be virtuallyunconscious, or like a dead person. Since every living entity is part and parcelof Kåñëa, anyone who falsely identifies with the external body is actuallyunconscious of his real position. Thus it is stated, çünyäya kalpate: pursuingthat which has no factual existence, he is devoid of any tangible progress orbenefit in life. One whose consciousness is absorbed in the nonexistentbecomes himself practically nonexistent. In this way, the eternal living entitiesbecome fallen, lost in the ocean of material existence, and it is only by thespecial mercy of the pure devotees of the Lord that they can be rescued. TheLord's devotees therefore instruct the fallen people to chant Hare Kåñëa, HareKåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, HareHare. By this process our real consciousness and life can be quickly revived.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the previous verse Lord Kåñëa stated that persons absorbed in sensegratification certainly deviate from the real purpose of human life. But sincethe Vedas themselves promise heavenly sense gratification as the result ofsacrifice and austerity, how can such promotion to heaven be considered adeviation from the goal of life? The Lord here explains that the fruitiverewards offered in religious scriptures are merely inducements, like candy thatis used to induce a child to take medicine. It is actually the medicine that isbeneficial, and not the candy. Similarly, in fruitive sacrifices it is the worshipof Lord Viñëu that is beneficial, not the fruitive reward itself. According toBhagavad-gétä, those professing fruitive rewards to be the ultimate goal ofreligious scripture are certainly less intelligent fools inimical to the purpose ofthe Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord desires that all conditionedsouls be purified and come back home, back to Godhead, for an eternal life ofbliss and knowledge. One who opposes the Lord's purpose in the name ofreligiosity is certainly bewildered about the purpose of life.</div>

Activities performed in ignorance are beneficialneither for oneself nor others, just as the charitable activities one may performin a dream bestow no tangible benefit on real people. The conditioned soul isdreaming of a world separate from God, but any advancement experienced inthis dream world is merely hallucination. The Lord states in Bhagavad-gétä,sarva-loka-maheçvaram: [Bg. 5.29] He is the supreme enjoyer and Lord of allplanets and worlds.

<div class="Translation"> Those ignorant of their real self-interest are wandering on the path of material existence, gradually heading toward darkness. Why would the Vedas further encourage them in sense gratification if they, although foolish, submissively pay heed to Vedic injunctions?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Materialistic persons are not prepared to renounce society, friendship andlove, which are all based on sex indulgence, to instead take to a life ofrenunciation and self-realization. In order to bring such foolish persons underthe canopy of Vedic injunctions, the Vedas promise innumerable materialrewards, even promotion to heavenly planets, to those who faithfully executethe Vedic injunctions. As explained by the Lord, such rewards are like thecandy offered to a child, who then faithfully takes his medicine. Materialenjoyment is certainly the cause of suffering, since all enjoyable objects aresubject to destruction along with the so-called enjoyer. Material life is simplypainful and full of anxiety, frustration and lamentation. We become agitatedby seeing a so-called enjoyable object, such as the naked body of a woman, abeautiful residence, a sumptuous tray of food or the expansion of our ownprestige, but actually such imagined happiness is simply the intenseexpectation of a satisfaction that never comes. One remains perpetuallyfrustrated in material existence, and the more one tries to enjoy, the moreone's frustration increases. Therefore, the Vedic knowledge, which aims atultimate peace and happiness on the spiritual platform, cannot possiblyauthorize the materialistic way of life. Material rewards are employed by theVedas merely as inducements for the conditioned soul to take the medicine,submission to the Supreme Lord, Viñëu, through various types of sacrifice.Those who are veda-väda-rata claim that religious scriptures are meant tofacilitate sense gratification in the ignorance of conditioned life. The true goalof religion, however, is spiritual liberation, in which material sensegratification ceases to exist. The darkness of bodily attachment cannot exist inthe effulgent light of spiritual knowledge. In the ocean of spiritual bliss, theanxiety-ridden apparent pleasure of this world vanishes completely. The truemeaning of veda, or perfect knowledge, is to surrender to the Supreme Lord infull Kåñëa consciousness for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge as the Lord's faithful servant.</div>

As explained by the Lord to Çré Uddhava in aprevious chapter, there is no actual happiness in the material world, since onewill inevitably rotate throughout the various planetary environmentsstretching from heaven to hell and thus always be disturbed within thematerial atmosphere. Although the doctor may give a child candy-coveredmedicine, one who urges the child to eat the candy and throw away themedicine is certainly a great fool. In the same way, the flowery statements ofthe Vedas describing heavenly enjoyment do not award the real fruit of Vedicknowledge but merely supply decorative blossoms of sense gratification.

Even the demigods, who are permanent residents of heaven, arealways looking to the eternal abode of the Supreme Lord.

<div class="First">The word uktha-çasträù refers to the chanting of certain Vedic hymns, bywhich one obtains fruitive results in this world and the next.

Persons exploiting Vedicknowledge for bodily gratification are slaughtering themselves with theweapon of materialistic religious principles. They are also compared to thosetrying to see within a dense fog. The false bodily concept of life, in which oneignores the eternal soul within the body, is a dense fog of ignorance that blocksour vision of God. Lord Kåñëa therefore begins His instruction inBhagavad-gétä by clearing away the dense ignorance of the bodily concept oflife. Religion means the law of God. The Lord's final order, or law, is that everyconditioned soul surrender unto Him, learn to serve and love Him, and thus goback home, back to Godhead.

Being materialistic, they desire to attain the planets of theforefathers or demigods and thus worship such beings. Sometimes materialisticpersons are attracted to the subtle life-style of ghosts and worship ghostlycreatures. These methods constitute gross ignorance of the SupremePersonality of Godhead, who is the actual enjoyer of all sacrifice and austerity.The demons perform Vedic sacrifice but are inimical to Lord Näräyaëa, forthey consider the demigods, the forefathers or Lord Çiva to be equal to God.Although understanding the authority of Vedic rituals, they do not accept theultimate Vedic conclusion and therefore never surrender to God. Thus falsereligious principles flourish in the demoniac societies of the animal-killers.Although in countries like America people outwardly profess to be followers ofGod alone, actual worship and glorification is offered to innumerable popularheroes such as entertainers, politicians, athletes and other equally insignificantpersons. Animal-killers, being grossly materialistic, are inevitably attracted tothe extraordinary features of material illusion; they cannot understand thereal platform of Kåñëa consciousness, or spiritual life.</div>

<div class="First">Although the demigods are part and parcel of the Supreme Personality ofGodhead, demigod worship fosters the false idea that the demigods exist apartfrom the Supreme Lord. Such worship is avidhi-pürvakam, or an improperapproach to the Absolute Truth. Çréla Madhväcärya quotes from theHari-vaàça that among those primarily in the mode of ignorance there aresometimes manifestations of passion and goodness. Ignorant persons possessinga tendency toward goodness may go to hell but are also allowed a littleheavenly pleasure. Thus it can be seen that a man suffering in miserablefinancial or political conditions sometimes enjoys the company of a beautifulwife, though his general condition is hellish. Those in ignorance mixed slightlywith passion simply go to hell, and those purely in the mode of ignorance glidedown to the darkest region of hell. Those devoid of devotion to the SupremeLord are in ignorance in these three categories. Sometimes persons situated inthe mode of goodness accept the supremacy of the Supreme Lord but are moreattracted to the demigods, believing that through Vedic rituals they canachieve the same standard of living as the demigods. This proud tendency iscertainly an obstacle in the loving service of the Supreme Lord and ultimately causes falldown.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The Vedas, divided into three divisions, ultimately reveal the living entity as pure spirit soul. The Vedic seers and mantras, however, deal in esoteric terms, and I also am pleased by such confidential descriptions.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the previous verses Lord Kåñëa clearly refuted the concept that Vedicknowledge is meant for material enjoyment, and here the Lord summarizes theactual purpose of Vedic literature: self-realization. Although the conditionedsouls are struggling in the network of material energy, their actual existence istranscendental freedom in the kingdom of God. The Vedas gradually lift theconditioned soul out of the darkness of illusion and establish him in theeternal loving service of the Lord. As stated in the Vedänta-sütra (4.4.23),anävåttiù çabdät: "One who properly hears Vedic knowledge does not have to return to the cycle of birth and death."</div>
<div class="First">One may ask why the Lord Himself as well as the Lord's representatives, theVedic seers and mantras, speak in esoteric or indirect terms. As the Lord statesin Bhagavad-gétä, näham prakäçaù sarvasya: [Bg. 7.25] the Supreme Lord doesnot allow Himself to be taken cheaply, and thus He is not manifest tosuperficial or inimical people. Those who are polluted by the materialatmosphere are induced to purify themselves through Vedic rituals that offerfruitive results, just as a child is induced to take medicine by the offer of acandy reward. Because of the confidential nature of Vedic exposition, lessintelligent persons cannot appreciate the ultimate transcendental purpose ofthe Vedas, and consequently they fall down to the platform of sense gratification.</div>
<div class="First">The term brahmätma ("spirit soul") ultimately indicates the SupremePersonality of Godhead, who states in Bhagavad-gétä that knowledge of Him isräja-guhyam, the most confidential of all secrets. One who depends uponmaterial sense perception remains in gross ignorance of the Absolute Truth.One who depends upon mental and intellectual speculation may get a clue thatthe eternal soul and Supersoul are both within the material body. But one whodepends upon the Lord Himself, faithfully hearing the Lord's own message inBhagavad-gétä, perfectly understands the entire situation and goes back home,back to Godhead, having fulfilled the true purpose of Vedic knowledge.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to Vedic knowledge, the Vedic sound is divided into four phases,which can be understood only by the most intelligent brähmaëas. This isbecause three of the divisions are internally situated within the living entityand only the fourth division is externally manifested, as speech. Even thisfourth phase of Vedic sound, called vaikharé, is very difficult to understand forordinary human beings. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains thesedivisions as follows. The präëa phase of Vedic sound, known as parä, is situatedin the ädhära-cakra; the mental phase, known as paçyanté, is situated in thearea of the navel, on the maëipüraka-cakra; the intellectual phase, known asmadhyamä, is situated in the heart area, in the anähata-cakra. Finally, themanifest sensory phase of Vedic sound is called vaikharé.Such Vedic sound is ananta-pära because it comprehends all vital energieswithin the universe and beyond and is thus undivided by time or space.Actually, Vedic sound vibration is so subtle, unfathomable and deep that onlythe Lord Himself and His empowered followers such as Vyäsa and Närada canunderstand its actual form and meaning. Ordinary human beings cannotcomprehend all of the intricacies and subtleties of Vedic sound, but if onetakes to Kåñëa consciousness one can immediately understand the conclusionof all Vedic knowledge, namely Lord Kåñëa Himself, the original source ofVedic knowledge. Foolish persons devote their vital air, senses and mind tosense gratification and thus do not understand the transcendental value of theholy name of God. Ultimately, the essence of all Vedic sound is the holy nameof the Supreme Lord, which is not different from the Lord Himself. Since theLord is unlimited, His holy name is equally unlimited. No one can understandthe transcendental glories of the Lord without the Lord's direct mercy. Byoffenselessly chanting the holy names Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa,Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, one can enterinto the transcendental mysteries of Vedic sound. Otherwise the knowledge ofthe Vedas will remain durvigähyam, or impossible to penetrate.</div>

The Vedic sound branches out in thousands of directions, adorned with the different letters expanded from the syllable oà: the consonants, vowels, sibilants and semivowels. The Veda is then elaborated by many verbal varieties, expressed in different meters, each having four more syllables than the previous one.

Vedic soundemanates from the Supreme Lord and is vibrated to glorify and understandHim. The conclusion of all Vedic sound vibration is found in Bhagavad-gétä,wherein the Lord states, vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù: [Bg. 15.15] all Vedicknowledge is simply meant to teach us to know and love God.

The Vedas, elaborately analyzing all material duality as nothing but My illusory potency, ultimately completely negate this duality and achieve their own satisfaction.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Lord declared in the previous verse that He alone knows the ultimatepurpose of the Vedas, and now the Lord reveals that He alone is the ultimatebasis and purpose of all Vedic knowledge. The karma-käëòa section of theVedas prescribes ritualistic sacrifices for promotion to heaven. Such sacrificesare the Lord Himself. Similarly, the upäsanä-käëòa section of the Vedasdesignates different demigods as objects of ritualistic worship, and these deitiesare not different from the Lord Himself, being expansions of the Lord's body.In the jïäna-käëòa section of the Vedas different philosophical methods ofanalysis are presented and refuted. Such knowledge, which analyzes thepotency of the Supreme Lord, is not different from Him. Ultimately LordKåñëa is everything, because everything is part and parcel of the Lord'smultipotencies. Although Vedic literature entices those absorbed in materialduality to begin the Vedic way of life by offering them materially desirablerewards, the Vedas eventually refute all material duality by bringing one to thestage of God consciousness, wherein there is nothing different from the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="First">Within the Vedic literature there are various injunctions stating that at aparticular stage of life one should give up fruitive rituals and take to the pathof knowledge. Similarly, other injunctions declare that a self-realized soulshould give up the path of speculative knowledge and take directly to theshelter of the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. But nowhere isthere an injunction recommending that one give up the loving service of theLord, because that is the eternal constitutional position of every living entity.Different philosophical theses are presented and rejected in the Vedas, sinceone who is progressing must give up each previous stage in the advancement ofknowledge. For example, one who is addicted to sex enjoyment is taught toaccept religious marriage and enjoy sex pleasure with his wife. Such ritualisticknowledge is to be given up when one attains the stage of detachment,whereupon one is recommended to take the renounced order of life. In thatstage of life one is forbidden to see or speak with women. When, however, onereaches the perfection of Kåñëa consciousness, wherein the Lord is manifesteverywhere, one may engage all living entities, including women, in the lovingservice of the Lord without danger of spiritual falldown. Thus differentinjunctions based on progressive stages of spiritual vision are presented andrefuted in Vedic literature. Since all such injunctions and processes areultimately meant for the achievement of Kåñëa consciousness, the lovingservice of the Lord, they are not different from Lord Kåñëa Himself. Theconditioned soul, therefore, should not prematurely stop his progressive marchback home, back to Godhead, by foolishly mistaking an intermediate orpreliminary stage of advancement as the actual goal of life. One mustunderstand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, is the source,maintenance and resting place of everything, and that every living entity isthe Lord's eternal servant. In this way one should continue on the Vedic pathall the way back home, back to Godhead, for eternal life of bliss and knowledge.</div>
<div class="First">Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Twenty-first Chapter,of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Lord Kåñëa's Explanation of the Vedic Path."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">22. Enumeration of the Elements of Material Creation</div>
<div class="First">This chapter enumerates and categorizes the natural elements, explains thedifference between the male and female natures and describes birth and death.There are many opinions concerning the number of material elements. Butthis difference of opinions, brought about by the influence of the illusoryenergy, is not illogical. All the elements of nature exist everywhere; soauthorities who have accepted the illusory potency of the Supreme Personalitymay propose a variety of theories. The insurmountable illusory energy of Godis the root cause of their mutually contradictory arguments.There is no difference between the ultimate enjoyer and the supremecontroller. To presuppose any distinction between them is senseless. Ordinaryknowledge is simply a quality of material nature, not of the soul proper. Theraw substance of material nature is designated according to its differentphases. In the mode of goodness, it is known as knowledge, in the mode ofpassion as activity, and in the mode of darkness as ignorance. Time is anothername of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and another name for materialpropensity is sütra or mahat-tattva. The twenty-five elements of nature are theLord, nature, the mahat, false ego, ether, air, fire, water, earth, the eyes, theears, the nose, the tongue, the skin, speech, the hands, the feet, the genitals,the anus, the mind, sound, touch, form, taste and smell.The unmanifest Supreme Personality merely glances at nature. Materialnature, which is under the control of the Supreme Lord, then assumes theforms of causes and effects and carries out the creation, maintenance anddestruction of the material world. Even though the puruña and prakåti appearnondifferent to superficial vision, there is an ultimate difference between thetwo. Material creation is produced from the modes of prakåti, and its quality istransformation. The living entities who are inimical to the SupremePersonality of Godhead take on and give up various kinds of material bodiesthrough the agency of their own material work. But those who are ignorant ofthe self, because of being bewildered by illusion, do not understand this. Themind, which is filled with ideas of fruitive work, simply takes the senses with itfrom one body to another, while the soul follows along. Nevertheless, onaccount of being totally absorbed in sense gratification, one cannot remember his past existence.</div>
<div class="First">The body undergoes nine stages of manifestation, which are brought aboutby association with the qualities of material nature. These are impregnation,gestation, birth, childhood, youth, maturity, middle age, old age and death.From the death of one's father and the birth of one's son, a person can easilycomprehend the rise and fall of his own body. The soul, who is the perceiver, isdifferent from this body. But when there is no knowledge of the true facts, theliving entity, confused by the objects of sense gratification, achieves hisdestinations within the cycle of material existence. Thus the living entitycontinuously wanders under the spell of material work, taking birth as a sageor a demigod when he is predominated by the mode of goodness, among thedemons or human beings when he is predominantly influenced by the mode ofpassion, and in the species of ghosts, spirits or animals when he ispredominated by the mode of ignorance. The spirit soul does not engage in theenjoyment of sense objects; rather, it is the senses that perform this activity.Therefore the living being has no actual need for sense gratificatory pleasures.With the exception of those peaceful personalities who have taken shelter ofthe lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and are dedicated to thedivine duty of His service, everyone, including so-called learned scholars, isinevitably overcome by the all-powerful material nature.</div>

Different philosophers havehistorically disagreed over the exact number of material elements, about theexistence and nonexistence of particular external objects and about theexistence of the soul itself. The jïäna-käëòa section of the Vedas aims atliberation through analytic understanding of the material world and of thespirit soul as a transcendental element beyond matter. Ultimately the SupremeLord Himself stands above all elements and maintains them by His personalpotency. Uddhava mentions in numerical terms different methodologies ofvarious sages, citing first the Lord's own opinion. The word äyuñman, or"possessing eternal form," is significant in this regard. Since Lord Kåñëa iseternal, He possesses all knowledge of past, present and future and is thus the original and supreme philosopher.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the different analyticapproaches mentioned by Çré Uddhava are actually not contradictory, sincethey are different methods of categorizing the same reality. Atheisticspeculation on reality does not recognize the existence of God; consequently itis a worthless attempt to explain the truth. The Lord Himself empowersdifferent living entities to speculate and speak on reality in different ways.The actual reality, however, is the Lord Himself, who will now speak to Çré Uddhava.</div>

<div class="First">The words santi sarvatra in this verse indicate that all material elements arefound within each other in gross and subtle forms. In this way there areinnumerable ways to categorically describe them. The material world isultimately illusory, undergoing constant transformation. It may be measured indifferent ways, just as the mirage of an oasis may be described in differentways, but the Lord's own analysis of twenty-eight elements is perfect andshould be accepted. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé states that the word mäyä in this versedoes not refer to mahä-mäyä, or the potency of ignorance, but to the Lord'sinconceivable mystic power, which shelters the learned followers of Vedicknowledge. Each of the philosophers mentioned here reveals a particularaspect of truth, and their theories are not contradictory, since they are simplydescribing the same phenomena with different categorical systems. Suchphilosophical disagreement is endless within the material world; thus everyoneshould unite on the platform of the Lord's own opinion, as stated in this verse.Similarly, in Bhagavad-gétä Lord Kåñëa requests all conditioned souls to give uptheir various forms of worship and surrender unto Him in full Kåñëaconsciousness, becoming His devotees. Thus the whole universe can be unitedin love of Godhead by chanting Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, HareHare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. By the Lord'srevealing Himself to a sincere devotee, the controversy of analytic philosophy is ended.</div>

Such logicalor rational proposing, doubting, counter-proposing, counteracting, etc., takethousands of different forms and become the basis of argument. Actually, theSupreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa, is the basis of all existence,since everything emanates from the Lord, is maintained by the Lord and at theend is merged to rest within the Lord. Lord Kåñëa is para-tattva, the highesttruth underlying all other dependent truths. In a society of learned personswho have understood the Personality of Godhead to be everything, there is nofurther cause of philosophical quarrel. Such unity of opinion is not based onthe absence of philosophical inquiry, nor on the stifling of rational discussion,but is the natural result of spiritual enlightenment. So-called philosophersproudly boast that they are searching and researching for the Absolute Truth,yet they somehow consider one who has found the Absolute Truth to be lessintelligent than one who has not found it but is searching. Because Lord Kåñëais the Absolute Truth, one who fully surrenders to the Lord becomes the most learned person.</div>

The examplemay be given that we find the dormant existence of an earthen pot within mudand also the existence of mud within the earthen pot. Similarly, one element ispresent within another, and ultimately all elements rest within the SupremePersonality of Godhead, who is simultaneously within everything. By suchexplanations, Kåñëa consciousness constitutes the ultimate scientificmethodology for factually understanding this universe.</div>

<div class="First">Although the Lord tolerates different methods of calculating materialcauses within their effects and material effects within their causes, therecannot be any speculation regarding the two spiritual elements found in thisuniverse, namely the individual soul and the Supersoul. Lord Kåñëa clearlystates in this verse that the living entity is incapable of effecting his ownenlightenment. The Supreme Lord is tattva-jïa, omniscient, and jïäna-da, thespiritual master of the entire universe. Çré Uddhava mentioned that somephilosophers describe twenty-five elements and others twenty-six. Thedifference is that the twenty-six elements include a separate category for theindividual soul and the Supreme Soul, Lord Kåñëa, whereas the proponents oftwenty-five elements artificially merge the two transcendental categories ofjéva-tattva and viñëu-tattva, hiding the eternal supremacy of the Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="First">Knowledge based on the three modes of material nature cannot rise to thetranscendental platform, where the Personality of Godhead exists as thesupreme enjoyer of eternal spiritual varieties of form, color, flavor, musicalsounds and loving affairs. Mundane philosophers simply bounce back and forthbetween material enjoyment and material renunciation. Being victims ofMäyäväda (impersonal) perception of the Absolute Truth, they cannotachieve the shelter of the Personality of Godhead and thus cannot understandHim. Because foolish, impersonal philosophers consider themselves supreme,they are unable to appreciate that loving service exists on the spiritualplatform. Stubbornly rejecting subservience to the Personality of Godhead, theimpersonalists are eventually overwhelmed by the illusory potency of the Lordand undergo the miseries of material existence. The Vaiñëavas, on the otherhand, are not envious of the Personality of Godhead. They gladly accept Hisshelter and supremacy, and thus the Lord personally takes charge of Hisdevotees and enlightens them, filling them with His own transcendental bliss.Spiritual service to the Supreme Lord is in this way free from the disappointment and repression of material service.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to certain philosophers there are twenty-five elements, amongwhich a single category is stipulated for both the individual living entity andthe Supreme Lord. Such impersonal knowledge is declared by the Lord to bematerial: jïänaà ca prakåter guëaù. Such knowledge can, however, be acceptedto establish the qualitative identity of the Supreme Lord and the living entitieswho expand from Him. Materialistic persons sometimes believe that there is asupreme spirit in heaven but also think that human beings are identical withtheir material bodies and thus qualitatively and perpetually separated from theSupreme Lord. Knowledge of the Lord's qualitative oneness with the livingentity, as described in this verse, refutes the materialistic concept of life andpartially establishes the Absolute Truth. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu describedthe actual situation as acintya-bhedäbheda-tattva(96): the supreme controllerand the controlled living entities are simultaneously one and different. In thematerial mode of goodness the oneness is perceived. As one proceeds further,to the stage of viçuddha-sattva, or purified spiritual goodness, one findsspiritual variety within the qualitative oneness, completing one's knowledge ofthe Absolute Truth. The words na vailakñaëyam aëv api boldly affirm that theindividual living entity is indisputably part and parcel of the Supreme Lordand qualitatively one with Him. Any philosophical attempt to separate theliving entity from the Supreme Lord and deny his eternal servitude to the Lordis thus refuted. Speculation arriving at the conclusion that the living entityhas independent existence separate from the Lord is described here as apärthä,useless. Nevertheless, the theory of twenty-five elements is acceptable to theLord as a preliminary phase in the evolution of spiritual knowledge.</div>

In Bhagavad-gétä LordKåñëa has declared the material elements constituting the body to be Hisseparated, inferior energy, whereas the living entity is the superior, consciousenergy of the Lord. Still, in conditioned life the material body and conditionedsoul appear inseparable and thus nondifferent. Because the living entity entersthe womb of a mother and gradually comes out in a developed body, the soulappears to have entered deeply within material nature. Similarly, by the soul'sidentification with the material body, the body appears to enter deeply withinthe consciousness of the soul. What is more, the body cannot exist without thepresence of the soul. By this apparent mutual dependence, the differencebetween the body and soul is obscured.

<div class="First">Form is recognized by the function of the eye, and the eye's function isunderstood by the presence of perceivable form. This interaction of sight andform further depends on the presence of light provided by the demigods, whoseservice of universal management depends on the presence of those who are tobe managed, namely the living entities experiencing form with their eyes.Thus the three factors-adhyätma, represented by the senses such as the eye;adhibhüta, the sense objects such as form; and adhidaiva, the influence of thecontrolling deities—exist in an interdependent relationship.The sun globe itself is said to be self-manifest, self-luminous andself-experiencing; it does not share the interdependence of the senses andsense objects although facilitating their function. Similarly, the SupremePersonality of Godhead facilitates the interdependent experiences of all livingentities. For example, newspapers, radio and television reveal world events tothe mass of people. Parents reveal facts about life to their children, teachers totheir students, friends to friends, and so on. The government manifests its willto the people and the people to their government. The sun and moon revealthe visual forms of all objects, and the perception of sound reveals audibleform. The vibrations of particular types of music or rhetoric reveal the innerfeelings of other living beings, and other types of knowledge are revealed byaroma, touch and taste. In this way, through the interaction of the senses andmind with innumerable sense objects, different types of knowledge areacquired. All such informative interactions, however, depend upon thesupreme illuminating power of the Personality of Godhead. As stated inBrahma-saàhitä (5.52), yac-cakñur eña savitä sakala-grahäëäm: "Among all theplanets the sun is considered the eye of the Supreme Lord." The Personality ofGodhead is eternally omniscient by His own transcendental potency, and thusno one can reveal anything to the Lord about anything. Still, Lord Kåñëahumbly accepts our prayers offered in Kåñëa consciousness. In conclusion,Lord Kåñëa clearly explains here that His sublime characteristics arecompletely different from those of the manifest universe. The Lord istherefore the supreme transcendental entity, free from all material influence.</div>

<div class="First">One may ask how the subtle body, or mind, gives up its connection withone physical body and enters another. Such entering and leaving of physicalbodies is called birth and death by conditioned souls. One utilizes his presentsenses to meditate on the visible objects of this world—beautiful women,palatial estates, and so on—and similarly one daydreams about the heavenlyplanets described in the Vedas. As death occurs, the mind is pulled away fromthe objects of its immediate experience and enters another body to experiencea new set of sense objects. As the mind undergoes total reorientation there isthe apparent loss of one's previous mentality and creation of a new mind,though actually the same mind is experiencing, but in a different way.The conditioned soul is overwhelmed by the constant flow of materialexperience consisting of direct perception and abstract contemplation of theobjects of this world. One thereby loses his transcendental memory of hisrelationship with God. As soon as one identifies with this world he forgets hiseternal identity and surrenders to the false ego created by mäyä.</div>

<div class="Translation"> When the living entity passes from the present body to the next body, which is created by his own karma, he becomes absorbed in the pleasurable and painful sensations of the new body and completely forgets the experience of the previous body. This total forgetfulness of one's previous material identity, which comes about for one reason or another, is called death.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Depending on one's karma, or fruitive activities, one may achieve abeautiful, wealthy or powerful body or be degraded to an abominable conditionof life. Taking birth in heaven or in hell, the living entity learns to completelyidentify his ego with the new body and thus becomes absorbed in the pleasure,fear, opulence or suffering of the new body, completely forgetting theexperiences of the previous body. Death occurs when the specific karmaallotted to a physical body is finished. Since that particular body's karma isused up, it can no longer act upon one's mind; in that way one forgets theprevious body. The new body is created by nature so that one can experiencethe karma currently in effect. Consequently one's entire consciousnessbecomes absorbed in one's current body in order that one can fully experiencethe results of his previous activities. Because the living entity falsely identifieshimself as the body, bodily death is experienced as death of the soul. Actually,however, the soul is eternal and is never subject to creation or annihilation.This analytic knowledge of self-realization is easily understood in Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="First">The wealth, beauty, strength, intelligence, fame and detachment ofdifferent bodies are considered to be excellent, normal or inferior according tothe material situation.

Actually, the eternal soul exists beyond material duality butfalsely mistakes the material situation to be his own. The words asaj-jana-kådyathä are significant. A father may by nature be peaceful, but because his badson gets into trouble the father is forced to defend his son and consider hisson's enemies to be enemies of the entire family. Thus the bad son implicatesthe father in troublesome conflicts. Similarly, the spirit soul has no intrinsicproblems, but by creating a false identification with the material body the soulbecomes involved in the happiness and distress of the body.

<div class="First">The wavering flame of a candle sometimes waxes brightly and againbecomes weak. Finally it vanishes altogether. The waves of a flowing river riseand fall, creating innumerable shapes and patterns. The fruits of a treegradually take birth, grow, ripen, sweeten and eventually rot and die. Similarly,one can easily understand that one's own body is undergoing constanttransformation, and that the body is certainly subject to old age, disease anddeath. At different times of life the body exhibits degrees of sexual potency,physical strength, desire, wisdom and so on. As the body grows old, physicalstrength diminishes, but one's knowledge may increase even as the body undergoes such transformation.</div>
<div class="First">Material birth and death occur within the realm of segmented time. Thebirth, creation or production of a material object immediately connects it witha segmented sequence of subtle time within the material world. Thus itsdestruction or death is inevitable. The irresistible force of time moves so subtlythat only the most intelligent can perceive it. Just as the candle flamegradually diminishes, as the flowing currents move within the river or as fruitsgradually ripen on a tree, the material body is steadily moving towardinevitable death. The temporary body should therefore never be confused with the eternal, unchanging spirit soul.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Although the illumination of a lamp consists of innumerable rays of light undergoing constant creation, transformation and destruction, a person with illusory intelligence who sees the light for a moment will speak falsely, saying, "This is the light of the lamp." As one observes a flowing river, ever-new water passes by and goes far away, yet a foolish person, observing one point in the river, falsely states, "This is the water of the river." Similarly, although the material body of a human being is constantly undergoing transformation, those who are simply wasting their lives falsely think and say that each particular stage of the body is the person's real identity</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Although one may say, "This is the light of the lamp," there are innumerablerays of light being created, transformed and destroyed at every moment; andalthough one may speak of the water of the river, there is an ever-new supplyof different water molecules passing by. Similarly, when one meets a youngchild, one accepts that particular transitory phase of the body as the actualidentity of the person, considering him to be a child. One also considers an oldbody to be an old person. In fact, however, the material body of a humanbeing, just like the waves of a river or the radiation of a lamp, is merely atransformation of the three modes of material nature, the potency of theSupreme Lord. The real identity of a person is spirit soul, part and parcel ofLord Kåñëa, but as Lord Kåñëa proves in this verse, a conditioned soul isincapable of observing or understanding the subtle movements of time. Withthe gross vision of material consciousness one cannot ascertain the subtlesegments of material manifestation, which are impelled by the Lord Himself astime. The word måñäyuñäm in this verse indicates those who are uselesslywasting their time in ignorance without understanding the instructions of theLord. Such persons gullibly accept any particular phase of the body to be theactual identity of the spirit soul within the body. Because the spirit soul is notsubject to material transformation, when he engages himself in the eternalvariegated pleasure of Kåñëa consciousness, loving service to the SupremeLord, he will experience no further ignorance and suffering.</div>

In other words, karma represents a cycle of illusion in which eachillusory activity produces another.

The conditioned soul is similarly captivated by the concoctions ofthe material mind and intelligence, which convince him that he can becomethe enjoyer of the material world. Although different from the material bodyand never the actual performer of its activities, the conditioned soul is inducedto engage his body in material activities, which entangle him in the cycle ofbirth and death.

<div class="First">One may object that if Lord Kåñëa insists that material life is false, thenwhy should one endeavor to stop it? The Lord therefore explains here thatalthough not factual, material life stubbornly continues for one addicted tosense gratification, just as a frightening dream continues for one merged insleep. The word avidyamäna, "not existing," means that material life is based onmental concoction, in which one thinks, "I am a man," "I am a woman," "I am adoctor," "I am a senator," "I am a street sweeper" and so on. A conditioned soulenthusiastically performs his activities based on the imaginary identificationwith the body. Thus although the spirit soul exists and the body exists, thefalse identification with the body does not exist. Material life, based on a false idea, has no factual existence.</div>
<div class="First">After one awakens from a dream, the dim reflection of the dream maylinger in one's memory. Similarly, one engaging in the devotional service ofthe Lord may be troubled sometimes by the dim reflection of sinful life.

Consequently, inmaterial life one is in constant anxiety, trying to acquire the most excellentsense gratification for one's personal pleasure. If one realizes everything as theproperty of the Lord, however, he will see everything as meant for the Lord'spleasure. He will feel no personal anxiety, because he is satisfied simply to beengaged in the Lord's loving service.

<div class="First">Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Twenty-secondChapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Enumeration of the Elements of Material Creation."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">23. The Song of the Avanté Brähmaëa.</div>
<div class="First">This chapter tells the story of a mendicant sannyäsé from the Avantécountry as an example of how one should tolerate the disturbances and offenses created by evil persons.</div>
<div class="First">The harsh words of uncouth persons pierce the heart even more severelythan arrows. Yet a mendicant brähmaëa from the city of Avanté, even whilebeing attacked by wicked men, considered this trouble to be simply theconsequence of his own past deeds and tolerated it with utmost sobriety.Previously the brähmaëa had been an agriculturalist and merchant. He hadbeen extremely greedy, miserly and prone to anger. As a result, his wife, sons,daughters, relatives and servants were all deprived of every kind of enjoymentand gradually came to behave unaffectionately toward him. In due course oftime, thieves, family members and providence took away the sum total of hiswealth. Finding himself without any property and abandoned by everyone, the brähmaëa developed a deep sense of renunciation.</div>
<div class="First">He considered how the earning and preservation of wealth involve greateffort, fear, anxiety and confusion. Because of wealth, there arise fifteenunwanted items-thievery, violence, lying, deception, lust, anger, pride,feverishness, disagreement, hatred, distrust, conflict, attachment to women,gambling and intoxication. When this meditation arose in his heart, thebrähmaëa could understand that the Supreme Lord Çré Hari had somehowbecome satisfied with him. He felt that only because the Lord was pleased withhim had the apparently unfavorable turn of events in his life occurred. He wasgrateful that a sense of detachment had arisen in his heart and considered itthe factual means for delivering his soul. In this condition he determined toengage the duration of his life in the worship of Lord Hari and thus acceptedthe mendicant order of tridaëòi-sannyäsa. Subsequently, he would enterdifferent villages to beg charity, but the people would harass and disturb him.But he simply tolerated all this, remaining firm as a mountain. He remainedfixed in his chosen spiritual practice and sang a song renowned as the Bhikñu-géta.</div>
<div class="First">Neither mortal persons, the demigods, the soul, the ruling planets, thereactions of work nor time are the causes of one's happiness and distress.Rather, the mind alone is their cause, because it is the mind that makes thespirit soul wander in the cycle of material life. The real purpose of all charity,religiosity and so forth is to bring the mind under control. A person who hasalready composed his mind in meditation has no need for these otherprocesses, and for a person who is incapable of fixing his mind they are of nopractical use. The false conception of material ego binds the transcendentalsoul to material sense objects. The Avanté brähmaëa therefore becamedetermined to bring himself over the insurmountable ocean of materialexistence by rendering service to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord,Mukunda, with the same perfect faith in the Lord exhibited by the great devotees of the past.</div>
<div class="First">Only when one can focus his intelligence on the lotus feet of the SupremePersonality of Godhead can the mind be completely subdued; this is theessence of all practical prescriptions for spiritual advancement.</div>

This analysis, however, is superficial, since thepunishment is actually the cumulative result of one's past karma. Somerenunciants show lack of tolerance when presented with the remnants of theirprevious sins and thus are forced to enter again onto the path of impious life.Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu therefore instructs that one should become astolerant as a tree. If a neophyte on the path of devotional service to the Lord'spure devotees is attacked by envious persons, he must accept it as aconsequence of his previous fruitive activities. One should be intelligent andavoid future unhappiness by rejecting the ethic of an eye for an eye, a toothfor a tooth. If one refuses to enter into enmity with envious men, they will automatically leave him alone."</div>

According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, providence here refers to fires inthe home and other types of occasional misfortune. Effects of time here refersto the destruction of agricultural crops through seasonal irregularities andother such occurrences. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura points outthat one should not merely proclaim oneself to be a brähmaëa but shouldactually understand one's original identity as a servant of the Lord. Onedeclaring himself to be a brähmaëa but maintaining a materialistic mentality isnot a real brähmaëa, but rather a brahma-bandhu, or so-called brähmaëa. Thehumble devotees of Lord Viñëu, following the indications of the Vedicscriptures, refer to themselves as unfortunate and unable to understand thekingdom of God; they do not proudly proclaim themselves to be brähmaëas.Those who are wise, however, know that such humble devotees are actuallybrähmaëas whose hearts are cleansed by the pure mode of goodness.</div>

"Humanbirth is better than that of the demigods, ghosts, spirits, animals, trees, lifelessstones, and so forth, because the demigods simply enjoy celestial pleasures, andin other forms of life there is excessive suffering. It is only in human life thatone deeply considers one's ultimate benefit in life. Human birth is thereforemore desirable than even that of the demigods." Within human life theposition of a high-class brähmaëa is certainly most desirable. If a brähmaëa,however, gives up the devotional service of the Lord and works hard like açüdra simply for the prestige of his community, he is certainly on the platformof material sense gratification. The special qualification of the brähmaëas isthe spiritual knowledge by which they recognize every living entity to be aneternal servant of the Lord. A brähmaëa, free from false ego, thus feels himselflower than a blade of grass and tolerantly offers respect to all living entities.All human beings, and especially the brähmaëas, should avoid becoming killersof their own self-interest by neglecting Kåñëa consciousness, the loving serviceof the Lord.

Aperson who owns a luxurious mansion should install the Deity of the Lord andhold regular programs to propagate Kåñëa consciousness. Similarly, wealthshould be used to build temples of the Lord and publish literature scientificallyexplaining the Personality of Godhead. One who blindly renounces materialproperty without utilizing it in the service of the Lord does not understandthat everything belongs to the Personality of Godhead. Such blindrenunciation is based on the material idea that "This property could belong tome, but I don't want it." Everything, in fact, belongs to God; knowing this oneneither tries to enjoy nor to reject the things of this world, but peacefully engages them in the service of the Lord.</div>

<div class="First">The brähmaëa of Avanté thought that although he was an old man whomight die at any moment he could follow the example of Mahäräja Khaöväìga,who achieved the Lord's mercy in a single moment. Mahäräja Khaöväìga, asdescribed in the Second Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, fought valiantly onbehalf of the demigods, and they offered the king any benediction he mightdesire. Khaöväìga Mahäräja chose to find out the remaining duration of hislife, which unfortunately was a single moment. The king thereforeimmediately surrendered to Lord Kåñëa and achieved the spiritual world. Thebrähmaëa of Avanté desired to follow this example; with the blessings of thedemigods, who are all devotees of the Lord, he hoped to become fully Kåñëa conscious before giving up his body.</div>

<div class="First">According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, the acceptance ofthe tridaëòi-sannyäsa order of life is the chief indication that one has actuallytaken shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The three rods of thedaëòa, or staff, of the Vaiñëava sannyäsé indicate control of the body, mindand words by engaging them only in the loving service of the Lord. Thisprocedure helps one to become more tolerant than a tree, as recommended byÇré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. By strict control of one's body, mind and speech,the quality of tolerance becomes strengthened, and thus one manifests thefurther qualities of forgiving others, never wasting one's time, detachmentfrom sense gratification, lack of false pride in one's work and not hankering forliberation. One in this way gives up the mentality of materialistic persons, whoestablish so-called affectionate relationships of mutual flattery and exploiteach other for sense gratification. One who adopts the strict path of Kåñëaconsciousness, following in the footsteps of great souls, can achieve the shelter of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the mode of goodness one considers oneself to be a saintly or wise person,in the mode of passion one struggles for material success, and in the mode ofignorance one becomes cruel, lazy and sinful. By the combination of thematerial modes one identifies oneself as a demigod, a king, a rich capitalist, awise scholar, etc. These conceptions are material designations generated fromthe modes of nature, and they arrange themselves according to the tendency ofthe powerful mind to enjoy temporary sense gratification. The word baléyas inthis verse, meaning "very strong," indicates that the material mind becomesinsensitive to intelligent advice. Even if we are informed that we arecommitting many sins and offenses in order to earn money, we may still thinkthat money should be acquired at all costs, since without it one can neitherperform religious ceremonies nor gratify the senses with beautiful women,mansions and vehicles. Once the money is achieved, one suffers furtherproblems, but the stubborn mind will never heed good advice in this regard.One must therefore give up mental concoction and control the mind in Kåñëaconsciousness, as exemplified here by the brähmaëa from Avanté.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Although bodily pleasure and pain are felt by the soul, one must toleratesuch duality, understanding it to be a creation of one's own material mind. Ifone accidentally bites his own tongue or lip, he cannot become angry and pullout his own teeth. Similarly, all living beings are individual parts and parcels ofGod, and thus nondifferent from each other. All of them are meant to servethe Supreme Lord in spiritual equality. If the living beings give up theirmaster's service and instead quarrel among themselves, they will be forced tosuffer by the laws of nature. If the conditioned souls establish artificialrelationships of affection based on the material body and having nothing to dowith God, then time itself will destroy such relationships, and they will besubjected to further suffering. But if the individual living entities understandeach other to be of the same family, all having connection with the SupremeLord, their mutual friendship will develop. Thus one should not exhibit angerthat will be harmful to oneself and others. Although the brähmaëa wasreceiving kind offerings of charity from some people and being harassed andbeaten by others, he denied that these people were the ultimate cause of hishappiness and distress, for he was fixed on the platform of self-realization beyond the material body and mind.</div>

One cannot relish bodily happiness withoutidentifying oneself as the body. But as soon as such identification occurs, one isharassed by the innumerable pains and sufferings also inevitably presentwithin the same body. Bodily happiness and distress are administered by thedemigods, who can never be brought under our control; thus one remainssubject to the whims of providence on the material platform. If, however, onesurrenders to the Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa, the reservoir of allpleasure, one can reach the spiritual platform, where transcendental blissenlivens the liberated souls without any interrupting anxiety or unhappiness.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Because a dead body does not feel pleasure or pain, our happiness anddistress are due to our own consciousness, which is the nature of the soul. It isnot, however, the original function of the soul to enjoy material happiness andsuffer material distress. These are produced by ignorant material affection andenmity based on false ego. Our involvement in sense gratification drags ourconsciousness into the material body, where it is shocked by the inevitable bodily pains and problems.</div>
<div class="First">On the spiritual platform there is neither material happiness nor distressbecause there the living consciousness is fully engaged, without personaldesire, in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. This is the actualposition of happiness, aloof from false bodily identification.

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> If we assume that fruitive work is the cause of happiness and distress, we still are not dealing with the soul. The idea of material work arises when there is a spiritual actor who is conscious and a material body that undergoes the transformation of happiness and distress as a reaction to such work. Since the body has no life, it cannot be the actual recipient of happiness and distress, nor can the soul, who is ultimately completely spiritual and aloof from the material body. Since karma thus has no ultimate basis in either the body or the soul, at whom can one become angry?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The material body is composed of earth, water, fire and air, just like bricks,stones and other objects. Our consciousness, falsely absorbed in the body,experiences happiness and distress, and fruitive work (karma) is performedwhen we falsely consider ourselves to be the enjoyers of the material world.False ego is thus the illusory combination within our minds of the self and thebody, which are actually two separate objects. Since karma, or material work, isbased on illusory consciousness, these activities are also illusory and have nofactual basis in either the body or the soul. When a conditioned soul falselyconsiders himself to be the body, and consequently the enjoyer of the materialworld, he tries to find pleasure in illicit connection with women. Such sinfulactivity is based on his false concept of being the body and thus the enjoyer ofwomen and of the world. Since he is not the body, his activity of enjoying awoman does not actually exist. There is merely the interaction of twomachines, namely the two bodies, and the interaction of the illusoryconsciousness of the man and woman. The sensation of illicit sex occurswithin the material body and is falsely assimilated by the false ego as its ownexperience. Thus the miserable or pleasurable reactions of karma ultimatelyact upon the false ego and not upon the body, which is composed of dullmatter, nor upon the soul, which has nothing to do with matter. False ego isthe illusory concoction of the mind; it is specifically this false ego that issuffering happiness and distress. The soul cannot become angry at others, sincehe is not personally enjoying or suffering. Rather, the false ego is doing this.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This verse is quoted by Kåñëadäsa Kaviräja in his Caitanya-caritämåta(Madhya 3.6). Çréla Prabhupäda comments as follows. "In connection with thisverse, which is a quotation from Çrémad-Bhägavatam (11.23.57), ÇrélaBhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura says that of the sixty-four items requiredfor rendering devotional service, acceptance of the symbolic marks of sannyäsais a regulative principle. If one accepts the sannyäsa order, his main business isto devote his life completely to the service of Mukunda, Kåñëa. If one does notcompletely devote his mind and body to the service of the Lord, he does notactually become a sannyäsé. It is not simply a matter of changing dress. InBhagavad-gétä (6.1) it is also stated, anäçritaù karma-phalaà käryaà karmakaroti yaù/ sa sannyäsé ca yogé ca: one who works devotedly for the satisfactionof Kåñëa is a sannyäsé. The dress is not sannyäsa, but the attitude of service to Kåñëa is.</div>
<div class="First">"The word parätma-niñöhä means being a devotee of Lord Kåñëa. Parätmä,the Supreme Person, is Kåñëa. Éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù[Bs. 5.1]. Those who are completely dedicated to the lotus feet of Kåñëa inservice are actually sannyäsés. As a matter of formality, the devotee accepts thesannyäsa dress as previous äcäryas did. He also accepts the three daëòas. LaterViñëu Svämé considered that accepting the dress of a tri-daëòé wasparätma-niñöhä. Therefore sincere devotees add another daëòa, the jéva-daëòa,to the three existing daëòas. The Vaiñëava sannyäsé is known as atridaëòi-sannyäsé. The Mäyävädé sannyäsé accepts only one daëòa, notunderstanding the purpose of tri-daëòa. Later, many persons in the communityof Çiva Svämé gave up the ätma-niñöhä (devotional service) of the Lord andfollowed the path of Çaìkaräcärya. Instead of accepting 108 names, those inthe Çiva Svämé sampradäya follow the path of Çaìkaräcärya and accept the tennames of sannyäsa. Although Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu accepted thethen-existing order of sannyäsa (namely eka-daëòa), He still recited a versefrom Çrémad-Bhägavatam about the tridaëòa-sannyäsa accepted by thebrähmaëa of Avantépura. Indirectly He declared that within that ekadaëòa(one daëòa), four daëòas existed as one. Accepting ekadaëòa sannyäsa withoutparätma-niñöhä (devotional service to Lord Kåñëa) is not acceptable to ÇréCaitanya Mahäprabhu. In addition, according to the exact regulativeprinciples, one should add the jéva-daëòa to the tri-daëòa. These four daëòas,bound together as one, are symbolic of unalloyed devotional service to theLord. Because the ekadaëòi-sannyäsés of the Mäyäväda school are not devotedto the service of Kåñëa, they try to merge into the Brahman effulgence, whichis a marginal position between material and spiritual existence. They acceptthis impersonal position as liberation. Mäyävädé sannyäsés, not knowing thatÇré Caitanya Mahäprabhu was a tri-daëòé, think of Caitanya Mahäprabhu asan ekadaëòi-sannyäsé. This is due to their vivarta, bewilderment. InÇrémad-Bhägavatam there is no such thing as an ekadaëòi-sannyäsé; indeed, thetridaëòi-sannyäsé is accepted as the symbolic representation of the sannyäsaorder. By citing this verse from Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhuaccepted the sannyäsa order recommended in Çrémad-Bhägavatam. TheMäyävädé sannyäsés, who are enamored of the external energy of the Lord,cannot understand the mind of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu."To date, all the devotees of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, following in Hisfootsteps, accept the sannyäsa order and keep the sacred thread and tuft ofunshaved hair. The ekadaëòi-sannyäsés of the Mäyävädé school give up thesacred thread and do not keep any tuft of hair. Therefore they are unable tounderstand the purport of tridaëòa-sannyäsa, and as such they are not inclinedto dedicate their lives to the service of Mukunda. They simply think ofmerging into the existence of Brahman because of their disgust with thematerial existence. The äcäryas who advocate the daiva-varëäçrama (the socialorder of cätur-varëyam mentioned in Bhagavad-gétä) do not accept theproposition of äsura-varëäçrama, which maintains that the social order of varëa is indicated by birth.</div>
<div class="First">"The most intimate devotee of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, namelyGadädhara Paëòita, accepted the tridaëòa-sannyäsa and also acceptedMädhava Upädhyäya as his tridaëòi-sannyäsé disciple. It is said that from thisMadhväcärya the sampradäya known in western India as theVallabhäcärya-sampradäya has begun. Çréla Gopäla Bhaööa Vasu, who is knownas a småty-äcärya in the Gauòéya Vaiñëava-sampradäya, later accepted thetridaëòa-sannyäsa order from Tridaëòipäda Prabodhänanda Sarasvaté.Although acceptance of tridaëòa-sannyäsa is not distinctly mentioned in theGauòéya Vaiñëava literature, the first verse of Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé'sUpadeçämåta advocates that one should accept the tridaëòa-sannyäsa order by controlling the six forces:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">väco vegaà manasaù krodha-vegaà</div>

<div class="First">"One who can control the forces of speech, mind, anger, belly, tongue andgenitals is known as a gosvämé and is competent to accept disciples all over theworld.' The followers of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu never accepted theMäyäväda order of sannyäsa, and for this they cannot be blamed. Çré CaitanyaMahäprabhu accepted Çrédhara Svämé, who was a tridaëòi-sannyäsé, but theMäyävädé sannyäsés, not understanding Çrédhara Svämé, sometimes think thatÇrédhara Svämé belonged to the Mäyäväda ekadaëòa-sannyäsa community.

<div class="Chapnum">24. The Philosophy of Säìkhya</div>
<div class="First">In this chapter Lord Kåñëa gives instruction how bewilderment of the mindcan be dispelled by the science of Säìkhya. Herein the Supreme Lord againimparts to Uddhava instruction about the analysis of material nature. Byassimilating this knowledge the spirit soul can drive away his confusion based on false dualities.</div>
<div class="First">In the beginning of creation, the seer and seen are one andindistinguishable. This Supreme Absolute Truth, one without a second andinaccessible to words and mind, then separates into two-the seer, which meansconsciousness or personality, and the seen, which means substance or nature.The material nature, which comprises the three modes of matter, is agitated bythe controlling male factor. The mahat-tattva then becomes manifest togetherwith the energies of consciousness and activity. From these come the principleof false ego in its three aspects of goodness, passion and ignorance. From falseego in the mode of ignorance arise fifteen subtle forms of sense perception,followed by the fifteen physical elements. From false ego in the mode ofpassion come the ten senses, and from false ego in the mode of goodness comethe mind and the eleven demigods who preside over the senses. By theconglomeration of all of these elements grows the universal egg, in the midst ofwhich the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the creating Lord of theuniverse takes up residence in the role of indwelling Supersoul. From the navelof this ultimate creator comes a lotus, upon which Brahma takes birth. LordBrahma, invested with the mode of passion, executes austerities by the grace ofthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, and on the strength of these penanceshe is able to create all the planets of the universe. The region of heaven ismeant for the demigods, that of inner space for ghostly spirits and that of theearth for human beings and others. In the region above these three planetarysystems are the places of advanced sages, and in the lower worlds are those ofthe demons, Näga serpents and so forth. The goals achieved by activities basedon the three modes of material nature are all within the three mortal worlds.The destinations of yoga, severe austerity and the renounced order of life arethe worlds known as Mahar, Janas, Tapas and Satya. The goal of devotionalservice to the Supreme Lord, on the other hand, is the lotus feet of thePersonality of Godhead in His abode, Vaikuëöha. This universe of materialaction and reaction is constituted under the control of time and the threemodes of material nature. Moreover, whatever exists in this universe is simplythe product of the combination of material nature and her Lord. In the sameway that creation proceeds gradually from the one and supremely subtle to themultitudinous and very gross, the process of annihilation proceeds from thegrossest to the subtlest manifestation of nature, leaving only the eternalspiritual substance. This ultimate Soul remains situated within Himself, aloneand without end. The mind of a person who meditates on these ideas does notbecome bewildered by material dualities. This science of Säìkhya, narrated inalternating sequences of creation and annihilation, serves to cut off all doubts and bondage.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the previous chapter the Lord explained that one can give up materialduality by controlling the mind and fixing it in Kåñëa consciousness. Thischapter describes the Säìkhya system, in which the difference between matterand spirit is elaborately explained. By hearing this knowledge one can easilyseparate the mind from material contamination and fix it on the spiritualplatform in Kåñëa consciousness. The Säìkhya philosophy system mentionedhere is that presented by Lord Kapila in the Third Canto ofÇrémad-Bhägavatam and not the atheistic Säìkhya presented later bymaterialists and Mäyävädés. The material elements, which emanate from thepotency of the Lord, evolve in a progressive sequence. One should notfoolishly think that such evolution begins from an original material elementwithout the assistance of the Lord. This speculative theory is generated fromthe false ego of conditioned life and constitutes gross ignorance, unacceptable to the Personality of Godhead and His followers.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Kåta-yuga is the first age, also known as Satya-yuga, in which knowledge,being perfect, is not different from its object. In modern society, knowledge ishighly speculative and constantly changing. There is often a vast differencebetween people's theoretical ideas and actual reality. In Satya-yuga, however,people are viveka-nipuëäù, or expert in intelligent discrimination, and thusthere is no difference between their vision and reality. In Satya-yuga, thepopulation in general is self-realized. Seeing everything as the potency of theSupreme Lord, they do not artificially create duality between themselves andother living entities. This is a further aspect of the oneness of Satya-yuga. Atthe time of annihilation, everything merges to rest within the Lord, and atthat time also there is no difference between the Lord, who becomes the onlyseer, and the objects of knowledge, which are contained within the Lord. Theliberated living entities in the eternal spiritual world are never subject to suchmerging but remain forever undisturbed in their spiritual forms. Because theyare voluntarily one with the Lord in love, their abode is never annihilated.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Lord casts His glance over material nature to remind her that theconditioned souls have not worked out their chain of fruitive activity andmental speculation and that creation is therefore again necessary. The Lorddesires that the conditioned souls get the opportunity to become Kåñëaconscious in love of Godhead by understanding the futility of life without theLord. The modes of nature arise after the glance of the Lord and becomeinimical to one another, each mode attempting to conquer the other two.There is constant competition between birth, maintenance and annihilation.Although a child desires to take birth, the cruel mother may desire to kill thechild through abortion. Although we may desire to kill the weeds in a field,they stubbornly take birth again and again. Similarly, we often desire tomaintain our physical status quo, but still deterioration sets in. Thus there isconstant competition among the modes of nature, and by their combinationsand permutations the living entities try to enjoy innumerable materialsituations without Kåñëa consciousness. The word puruñänumatena indicatesthat the Lord sets the stage for such material futility so that the conditionedsouls will eventually come back home, back to Godhead.</div>

In thematerial world, one's real knowledge is covered by fruitive activity and mentalspeculation. As one's devotional service to the Lord slackens, these twotendencies grow automatically, just as the diminishing of light automatically brings an increase in darkness.</div>

<div class="First">The word cid-acin-maya, "encompassing both spirit and matter," issignificant in this regard.

Struggling to enjoy, he becomes more and more entangled in thecomplexities of illusion and only increases his anxiety.

<div class="First">Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains that the word tapasaù in this verse refers toausterities performed by brahmacärés and vänaprasthas. A brahmacäré whopractices celibacy perfectly in some particular stage of his life achievesMaharloka, and one who perfectly practices lifelong celibacy achievesJanaloka. By perfect execution of vänaprastha one may achieve Tapoloka, andone in the renounced order of life goes to Satyaloka. These differentdestinations certainly depend on one's seriousness in the yoga system. In theThird Canto of the Bhägavatam, Lord Brahmä explains to the demigods, "Theinhabitants of Vaikuëöha travel in their airplanes made of lapis lazuli,emeralds and gold. Although crowded by their consorts, who have large hipsand beautiful smiling faces, they cannot be stimulated to passion by their mirthand beautiful charms." (SB 3.15.20) Thus in the spiritual world, the kingdom ofGod, the inhabitants have absolutely no desire for personal satisfaction, sincethey are completely satisfied in love of Godhead.

<div class="Translation"> Gold and earth are originally existing as ingredients. From gold one may fashion golden ornaments such as bracelets and earrings, and from earth one may fashion clay pots and saucers. The original ingredients gold and earth exist before the products made from them, and when the products are eventually destroyed, the original ingredients, gold and earth, will remain. Thus, since the ingredients are present in the beginning and at the end, they must also be present in the middle phase, taking the form of a particular product to which we assign for convenience a particular name, such as bracelet, earring, pot or saucer. We can therefore understand that since the ingredient cause exists before the creation of a product and after the product's destruction, the same ingredient cause must be present during the manifest phase, supporting the product as the basis of its reality.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Lord here explains that the original cause is certainly present in itseffect, citing the example of gold and clay functioning as the causalingredients of many different products in which gold and clay continue to bepresent.

<div class="Translation"> A material object, itself composed of an essential ingredient, creates another material object through transformation.

A particular thing may thus be called real in that it possesses the basic nature of another object that constitutes its origin and final state.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">One may understand the purport of this verse through the simple analogyof a clay pot. A clay pot is formed from a lump of clay, which is itself preparedfrom the earth. In this case earth is the original ingredient forming the claylump, and the clay lump is in a sense the original cause of the pot. When thepot is destroyed, it will again assume the designation clay and ultimately mergeback into the earth, its original cause. In relation to the clay pot, clay is thebeginning and final state; thus the pot is called real, for it possesses theessential characteristics of clay, which exists before and after the existence ofthe functioning instrument known as the pot. Similarly, earth exists beforeand after the clay, and thus clay may be considered real because it possesses theessential characteristics of earth, which exists before and after the existence ofthe clay. Similarly, earth and other elements are created from the mahat-tattva,which exists before and after the existence of the elements, which may beconsidered real because they possess the essential characteristics of themahat-tattva. The mahat-tattva is ultimately the creation of the SupremePersonality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, who exists after all isannihilated. The Absolute Truth is the Supreme Lord Himself, who step by step gives meaning and character to all that exists.</div>

Form merges into touch, and touch merges into ether. Ether finally merges into the sensation of sound. The senses all merge into their own origins, the presiding demigods, and they, O gentle Uddhava, merge into the controlling mind, which itself merges into false ego in the mode of goodness. Sound becomes one with false ego in the mode of ignorance, and all-powerful false ego, the first of all the physical elements, merges into the total nature. The total material nature, the primary repository of the three basic modes, dissolves into the modes. These modes of nature then merge into the unmanifest form of nature, and that unmanifest form merges into time. Time merges into the Supreme Lord, present in the form of the omniscient Mahä-puruña, the original activator of all living beings.

<div class="First">Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Twenty-fourthChapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Philosophy of Säìkhya."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">25. The Three Modes of Nature and Beyond</div>
<div class="First">To establish the transcendental nature of the Supreme Personality ofGodhead, this chapter describes the various functional manifestations of thethree modes (goodness, passion and ignorance), which arise in the mind.Control of the mind, control of the senses, tolerance and so forth aremanifestations of the unmixed mode of goodness. Desire, endeavor, false prideand so on are manifestations of the unmixed mode of passion. And anger,greed and bewilderment are among the functions of the unmixed mode ofignorance. In the admixture of the three modes we find the concept of "I" and"my," behavior in accordance with this mentality by body, mind and words,adherence to the principles of religiosity, economic development and sensegratification, and the fixed pursuit of one's occupational duty for material interest.</div>
<div class="First">A person whose character is in the mode of goodness worships Lord Hari ina spirit of devotion, without regard to profit. On the other hand, one whohankers after the fruits of his worship of the Lord is passionate by nature. Andone who desires violence is in the mode of ignorance. These modes ofgoodness, passion and ignorance are present in the infinitesimal living entity,whereas the Supreme Personality of Godhead is transcendental to the three modes of material nature.</div>
<div class="First">The substance, place and result of activity, along with the time, theknowledge underlying action, the activity itself, the performer, his faith, hislevel of awareness, his spiritual progress and his destination after death, allpartake of the three modes and manifest variously in terms of distinctions andhierarchies. But objects related to the Supreme Personality, places connectedwith Him, happiness based on Him, the time occupied in His worship,knowledge related to Him, work offered to Him, the performer of work whoacts under His shelter, faith in His devotional service, progress toward thespiritual realm, and the destination of the Supreme Lord's personal abode all transcend the material modes.</div>
<div class="First">There are many different destinations and conditions of life for the spiritsoul within the cycle of material existence. These are all based on the modes ofnature and on fruitive activities, which are governed by the modes. It is onlyby practicing the yoga of pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord that onecan conquer the three modes, which arise originally from the mind. Afterobtaining a human body, which has the potential for developing knowledgeand realization, a person who is intelligent should renounce association withthe three modes of nature and then worship the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. First, by increasing the mode of goodness, one can defeat passionand ignorance. Then one can conquer material goodness by evolving hisconsciousness to the platform of transcendence. At that time he becomesentirely liberated from the material modes, gives up his subtle body (thematerial mind, intelligence and false ego) and attains the association of thePersonality of Godhead. By the shattering of his subtle covering, the livingentity is able to come face to face with the Supreme Lord and thus achieve absolute fulfillment by His grace.</div>

Thus we find that a materialmode does not occur in a pure, isolated form but rather is mixed with othermodes, thereby making possible normal functioning within this world.Ultimately one should think, "I am an eternal servant of Lord Kåñëa" and "Myonly possession is loving service to the Lord." This is the pure state of consciousness, beyond the material modes of nature.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Lord clearly explains here that spiritual knowledge of His supremepersonality is transcendental to ordinary religious knowledge in the mode ofgoodness. In the mode of goodness one understands the existence of a higherspiritual nature within all things. In the mode of passion one acquiresscientific knowledge of the material body. And in the mode of ignorance onefixes one's mind on the sense objects without higher awareness, perceiving things as a small child or a retarded person does.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Jéva Gosvämé elaborately explains in his commentary on this versethat the material mode of goodness does not award perfect knowledge of theAbsolute Truth. He quotes from Çrémad-Bhägavatam (6.14.2), proving thatmany great demigods in the mode of goodness could not understand thetranscendental personality of Lord Kåñëa. In the material mode of goodness,one becomes pious or religious, aware of a higher, spiritual nature. On thespiritual platform of purified goodness, however, one establishes a direct,loving relationship with the Absolute Truth, rendering service to the Lordrather than merely maintaining a connection to mundane piety. In the modeof passion the conditioned soul speculates about the reality of his ownexistence and of the world around him, and considers speculatively theexistence of a kingdom of God. In the mode of ignorance one acquiresknowledge for sense gratification, absorbing the mind in varieties of eating,sleeping, defending and sex, without any higher purpose. Thus, within themodes of nature the conditioned souls are trying to gratify their senses, or elsethey are trying to free themselves from sense gratification. But they cannotdirectly engage themselves in their constitutional, liberated activities untilthey come to the transcendental position of Kåñëa consciousness, beyond the modes of nature.</div>

<div class="First">Many creatures in the forest, such as the trees, wild boars and insects, areactually in the modes of passion and ignorance. But residence in the forest isdesignated as being in the mode of goodness because there one may live asolitary life free from sinful activities, material opulence and passionateambition. Throughout the history of India, many millions of persons from allwalks of life have adopted the orders of vänaprastha and sannyäsa and havegone to sacred forests to practice austerity and perfect their self-realization.Even in America and other Western countries, persons such as Thoreauachieved fame by retiring to the forest to reduce the scope and opulence of material involvement.</div>
<div class="First">The word gräma here indicates residence in the village of one's family.Family life is certainly full of false pride, false hopes, false affection,lamentation and illusion, since the family connection is squarely resting onthe bodily concept of life, the very opposite of self-realization. The worddyüta-sadanam, "gambling house," refers to pool halls, racetracks, poker clubs,bars and other sinful places that maintain an abysmal level of consciousness inthe mode of ignorance. Man-niketam refers to the Lord's own abode in thespiritual world as well as the Lord's temples within this world, wherein theDeity form of the Lord is appropriately worshiped. One who lives in thetemple of Lord Kåñëa, following the rules and regulations of temple life, isunderstood to be residing on the transcendental platform. In these verses theLord clearly explains that all material phenomena may be divided into threedivisions according to the modes of nature, and that ultimately there is thefourth, or transcendental, division—Kåñëa consciousness—which elevates all aspects of human culture to the liberated platform.</div>

<div class="First">The human form of life is a rare opportunity for achieving spiritualliberation in Kåñëa consciousness. Lord Kåñëa has elaborately described in thischapter the characteristics of the three modes of nature and thetranscendental situation of Kåñëa consciousness. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhuhas ordered us to take shelter of the holy name of Lord Kåñëa, by whichprocess we can easily transcend the modes of nature and begin our real life of loving devotional service to Lord Kåñëa.</div>
<div class="First">Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Twenty-fifth Chapter,of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Three Modes of Nature and Beyond."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">26. The Aila-gétä</div>
<div class="First">This chapter explains how unfavorable association is a threat to one'sposition in devotional service and how by associating with saintly persons one can attain the highest platform of devotion.</div>
<div class="First">The jéva who has received a human body, which is in itself most conducivetoward achieving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and who has situatedhimself in the duties of devotional service to the Lord becomes capable ofrealizing Him, the very identity of spiritual bliss. Such a person, fully dedicatedto the Supreme Personality, is liberated from the influence of Mäyä; evenwhile continuing to reside in this world created by illusion he is totallyuntouched by it. Those souls, on the other hand, who are bound up by Mäyä aredevoted only to their bellies and genitals. They are impure, and by associatingwith them one will fall down into the dark pit of ignorance.The emperor Purüravä, who was bewildered by the association of theheavenly lady Urvaçé, later became renounced after being separated from her.He thus sang a song expressing his contempt for womanly connection. Hedescribed that persons who are attached to the body of a woman (or aman)-which is simply a mass of skin, meat, blood, sinew, brain tissue, marrowand bones-are not much different from worms. What is the worth of theeducation, austerity, renunciation, reception of the Vedas, solitary living andsilence of one whose mind becomes stolen away by the body of a woman?Learned men should distrust their six mental enemies, headed by lust, and thusavoid associating with women or with men who are controlled by women.After declaring these facts, King Purüravä, now freed from the illusion ofmaterial existence, attained realization of the Supreme Lord in His form as the indwelling Supersoul.</div>
<div class="First">In conclusion, one who is intelligent should give up bad association and lethimself become attracted to the company of saintly persons. By theirtranscendental instructions, the saintly devotees of the Lord can break thefalse attachments of one's mind. Real saints are always liberated and devotedto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In their association there are constantdiscussions about the Supreme Lord, by serving whom the spirit soulcompletely eradicates his material sins and obtains pure devotional service.And when one gains the devotional service of the Supreme Personality ofGodhead, who is the original ocean of unlimited perfect qualities, what else remains to be gained?</div>

<div class="First">Because of bad association, even those who are spiritually liberated may falldown from self-realization. Within the material world the association ofwomen is especially dangerous, and therefore in this chapter the Aila-géta isspoken to prevent such a falldown. One can be saved from sex attraction byassociation with saintly persons, who awaken one's real spiritual intelligence.Therefore Lord Kåñëa will speak to Uddhava the amazing song of Purüravä, also known as the Aila-gétä.</div>

In otherwords, everything we see within the material world is constituted of the modesof nature. A liberated soul, although existing within the ocean of materialenergy, sees everything as the property of the Lord and is thus not entangled.Although Mäyä tempts such a liberated soul to become a thief—to steal theproperty of the Lord for sense gratification—a Kåñëa conscious person doesnot bite the bait of Mäyä; he remains honest and pure in Kåñëa consciousness.In other words, he does not believe that anything within the universe canbecome his personal property for sense gratification, especially the illusory form of a woman.</div>

King Purüraväfrankly admits here that the young lady Urvaçé is not to blame. After all, it wasPurüravä who mistakenly considered her to be an object of his personalenjoyment, and therefore he suffered the reaction by the laws of nature.Purüravä himself was the offender for trying to exploit the external form of Urvaçé.</div>

<div class="Translation"> One can never decide whose property the body actually is. Does it belong to one's parents, who have given birth to it, to one's wife, who gives it pleasure, or to one's employer, who orders the body around? Is it the property of the funeral fire or of the dogs and jackals who may ultimately devour it? Is it the property of the indwelling soul, who partakes in its happiness and distress, or does the body belong to intimate friends who encourage and help it? Although a man never definitely ascertains the proprietor of the body, he becomes most attached to it. The material body is a polluted material form heading toward a lowly destination, yet when a man stares at the face of a woman he thinks, "What a good-looking lady! What a charming nose she's got, and see her beautiful smile!"</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>

The man is attracted to Mäyä appearing within the female form,but when he embraces the woman's body he ends up with two handfuls ofstool, blood, mucus, pus, skin, bone, hairs and flesh. People should not be likecats and dogs, in the ignorance of bodily consciousness. A human being shouldbe enlightened in Kåñëa consciousness and learn to serve the Supreme Lord without falsely trying to exploit His potencies.</div>

<div class="Chapnum">27. Lord Kåñëa's Instructions on the Process of Deity</div>
<div class="First"> Worship</div>
<div class="First">In this chapter the Supreme Personality of Godhead explains the process of kriyä-yoga, or Deity worship.</div>
<div class="First">Worshiping the Deity form of the Supreme Lord automatically brings purityand satisfaction to the mind. Thus it is the source of all desirable gains. If aperson has no engagement in Deity service he will simply remain attracted tomaterial sense gratification, and he will have no hope of giving up badassociation. The Personality of Godhead has given instruction, among theregulations of the Sätvata scriptures, on the process of worshiping Him as thebona fide Deity. Brahmä, Çiva, Närada, Vyäsa and all other sages haverecommended this process described by the Lord as most perfectly beneficialfor all the occupational classes and spiritual orders of human society, including even the women and çüdras.</div>
<div class="First">There are three varieties of arcana, Deity worship, based on either theoriginal Vedas, the secondary tantras, or a combination of these. The Deityimage, the ground, the fire, the sun, the water and the heart of the worshiperare all true locations of the Deity's presence. The Deity form to be worshipedmay be constructed of any one of eight substances-stone, wood, metal, clay,paint, sand (drawn upon the ground), the mind or jewels. These categories arefurther subdivided into two: temporary and permanent.The details of the worshiping process are as follows: The devotee shouldbathe both physically and by chanting mantras, and then he should performthe utterance of Gäyatré at the prescribed juncture of the day. He shouldarrange a seat facing either east or north, or else directly facing the Deity, andshould bathe and clean the Deity. Then he should present clothing andornaments, sprinkle water on the vessels and other paraphernalia to be used inthe worship, and offer water for bathing the Deity's feet, arghya, water forwashing His mouth, fragrant oils, incense, lamps, flowers and foodpreparations. After this, one should worship the Lord's personal servants andbodyguards, His consort energies, and the spiritual masters by chanting theirrespective müla-mantras. The worshiper should recite prayers from thePuräëas and other sources, offer obeisances flat on the ground, beg forbenediction, and place on himself the remnants of the Lord's garlands.Included in this method of Deity worship are the proper installation of thetranscendental Deity by constructing a fine temple, and also the conducting ofprocessions and other festivals. By worshiping Lord Çré Hari withunconditional devotion in this manner, one gains access to pure loving serviceto His lotus feet. But if one steals property that has been given as charity to theDeity or the brähmaëas, whether given by himself or by others, he will have to take his next birth as a stool-eating worm.</div>

<div class="First">The devotees of the Lord understand themselves to be the Lord's eternalservitors; recognizing the Deity to be the Lord Himself, they permanentlyinstall the Deity and engage in perpetual worship. The impersonalists,however, regard the eternal form of the Lord as a temporary manifestation ofillusion. In fact, they regard the Deity form as a mere stepping—stone in theirambitious program to become God. Materialistic persons of whatever stripeconsider the Lord to be their order supplier, and so they make temporaryarrangements for religious ceremonies to achieve temporary material sensegratification. This temporary mode of worship is favored by those desiring toexploit the Personality of Godhead for their personal ends, whereas the lovingdevotees in Kåñëa consciousness eternally engage in worship of the Personalityof Godhead. They install permanent Deities meant to be worshiped perpetually.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Various classes of devotees worship the Deity of the Personality of Godheadaccording to their various stages of faith in the Lord. An advanced devotee ofLord Kåñëa understands his eternal loving relationship with the Lord and,seeing the Deity as the Lord Himself, establishes an eternal relationship withthe Deity based on loving servitude to Him. Understanding Lord Kåñëa to bethe eternal form of bliss and knowledge, a faithful devotee makes a permanentarrangement for Deity worship, installing the Lord's form made of, for example, stone, wood or marble.</div>
<div class="First">The çälagräma-çilä is considered to be automatically installed even withoutthe formal ceremony, and so it is forbidden to call the Deity with mantras orask the Deity to leave. On the other hand, if one prepares a Deity form bydrawing on sanctified ground or by constructing a sand image, one must callthe Deity with mantras and then ask the Deity to leave the external form,which will soon be demolished by the natural elements.The general principle is that a pure devotee of the Lord understands hisrelationship with the Deity to be eternal. The more one surrenders in lovingdevotion to the Deity, the more one can understand the Supreme Personalityof Godhead. Lord Kåñëa is a person, but He is the Supreme Person, possessingHis own unique feelings. One can easily please the Lord by devotional serviceoffered to His Deity form. By pleasing the Lord one can gradually progress inthe mission of human life and eventually go back home, back to Godhead,where the Deity personally appears before the devotee and welcomes thedevotee to His personal abode, known throughout the world as the kingdom of God.</div>

<div class="Translation"> One should worship Me in My Deity forms by offering the most excellent paraphernalia. But a devotee completely freed from material desire may worship Me with whatever he is able to obtain, and may even worship Me within his heart with mental paraphernalia.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">A devotee still troubled by material desire tends to see the world as anobject of sense gratification. Such a neophyte devotee may misunderstand theLord's supreme position and may even consider the Lord an object of his ownenjoyment. Hence the neophyte must offer opulent paraphernalia to the Deityso that he may constantly remember that the Deity is the supreme enjoyer andthat he, the neophyte, is simply the worshiper and is actually meant for theDeity's pleasure. In contrast, an advanced devotee, one fixed in Kåñëaconsciousness, never forgets that the Supreme Lord is the actual enjoyer andcontroller of everything. The pure devotee offers his unalloyed love to thePersonality of Godhead along with whatever paraphernalia is easily obtained.A Kåñëa conscious devotee does not waver in his devotion to Lord Kåñëa, andeven with the simplest offering he completely satisfies the Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Lord has stated in the previous verse that even a little water offeredwith love and devotion gives Him great pleasure. Therefore the words kiàpunaù indicate the Lord's complete happiness when a suitably opulent offeringis made with love and devotion. But an opulent offering made by a nondevoteecannot please the Lord. As Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains, the rules andregulations concerning Deity worship and the listing of offenses against theDeities are all meant for helping one avoid precisely this kind of disrespectfulor neglectful attitude toward the Personality of Godhead in His Deity form. Infact, all offenses against the Deity are based upon irreverence and disregard forthe Lord's position as master, and thus upon disobedience to His orders. Sinceone must worship the Deity with reverence, one should offer opulentpresentations to the Deity with love, for such presentations both enhance therespectfulness of the worshiper and help him avoid offenses in his worship.</div>

<div class="First">According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the Gaëeça and Durgä mentioned in thisverse are not the same personalities present within the material world; rather,they are eternal associates of the Lord in Vaikuëöha. In this world Gaëeça, theson of Lord Çiva, is famous for awarding financial success, and the goddessDurgä, the wife of Lord Çiva, is famous as the external, illusory potency of theSupreme Lord. The personalities mentioned here, however, are eternallyliberated associates of the Lord who reside in the spiritual sky, beyond thematerial manifestation. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé quotes from various Vedicliteratures to prove that the name Durgä may also indicate the internalpotency of the Lord, who is nondifferent from Him. The external, or covering,potency of the Lord expands from this original Durgä. The Durgä of thematerial world, called Mahä-mäyä, assumes the function of bewildering theliving entities. Thus a devotee should not fear becoming polluted byworshiping the Durgä mentioned here, who has the same name as illusion, butrather the devotee must show respect to these eternal servitors of the Supreme Lord in Vaikuëöha.</div>

But throughthe process of installing the Deity by chanting of authorized mantras, oneinvites the Supreme Personality of Godhead to enter the Deity form. Byregulated, faithful worship one gradually understands that the Deity iscompletely nondifferent from the Supreme Lord Himself. At that stage, on thestrength of Deity worship, one rises to the second-class platform of devotionalservice. At this more developed stage one desires to make friendship withother devotees of the Lord, and as one becomes solidly established in thecommunity of Vaiñëavas, one completely gives up material life and gradually becomes perfect in Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="First">Stealing paraphernalia meant for worshiping the Supreme Lord or Hisauthorized representatives should be avoided at all costs.Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Twenty-seventhChapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Lord Kåñëa's Instructions on the Process of Deity Worship."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">28. Jïäna-yoga</div>
<div class="First">This chapter briefly summarizes the process of jïäna-yoga, which previous chapters described in detail.</div>
<div class="First">Every created thing in this universe is a material product of the threemodes of nature, is subject to sensory perception, and is essentially unreal.Actually, the designations of "good" and "bad" that we assign to the variousobjects and activities of this world are all superficial. It is better to avoidcondemning or praising anything of this world, because doing so simplyentangles one in matter and deprives one of the higher goals of spiritual life.Hidden within every object of the material universe is the spirit soul, whounderlies both the causes and products of manifest existence. One should seethings in this light and thus move about the material world in a mood of detachment.</div>
<div class="First">As long as there is a relationship between the bodily senses, which arecomprised of matter, and the soul, which is the reality, one will continue infalse consciousness. Although material existence is unreal, those who lackdiscrimination remain entangled in the cycle of birth and death because oftheir absorption in sense gratification. All the phases of material life-such asbirth, death, sorrow and happiness-belong not to the soul but to thematerialistic false ego. By learning to distinguish between the soul and itsopposite, matter, one can destroy this false identification.There is a single Absolute Truth present at the beginning and at the end ofthis world. During its interim, or maintenance, phase the cosmic manifestationis also founded upon the same Absolute Truth. This Absolute, Brahman, existseverywhere, both positively by its manifestations and negatively by itsaloofness. Brahman is unique in being self-sufficient, whereas this world is theexpansion of Brahman produced through the material mode of passion.By the mercy of a bona fide spiritual master, one can understand theAbsolute Truth and come to appreciate the nonspiritual nature of the materialbody and its extensions. Desisting from engagement in material senseenjoyment, one then becomes satisfied in the ecstasy of the self. Just as the sunremains untouched by the coming and going of clouds, the discriminating,liberated person remains unaffected by the activities of his senses.Nevertheless, until one becomes perfectly fixed in bhakti-yoga, pure devotionalservice to the Supreme Lord, one should carefully avoid contacting materialsense objects. An aspiring devotee may meet various obstacles and fall down,but in his next life he will continue his practice by dint of what he has alreadyaccomplished in devotional service. He will never again become bound up bythe laws of karma. The man who is liberated and established in discriminationwill under no circumstances seek false enjoyment by indulging in materialsense gratification. He knows that the soul is changeless and that any contraryconception imposed on the pure self is sheer illusion.If, during the immature stage of spiritual practice, one suffers physicaldisease or other disturbances, the Vedas enjoin that he should certainly takeproper measures to eradicate the problem. The prescribed remedies for lust andthe other enemies of the mind are meditation on the Supreme Lord andsaìkértana, the loud chanting of His names. The remedy for the disease of falseego is rendering service to the Supreme Lord's saintly devotees.By practicing yoga, some nondevotees keep their bodies youthful and fit,and may even achieve mystic perfections or long life. But these attainmentsare actually worthless, because they are perfections only of the material body.An intelligent person is therefore uninterested in this kind of process. Rather,by taking shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, an aspiring devoteewho is seriously dedicated to the Lord rids himself of all disturbances andbecomes empowered to attain the highest perfection, the full bliss of spiritual life.</div>

<div class="First">Material situations and activities appear to be good, passionate or ignorantaccording to the interaction of the modes of nature. These modes are producedby the illusory potency of the Lord, which is itself not different from itsmaster, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So a devotee of the Lord remainsaloof from the illusory, temporary manifestations of material nature. At thesame time, he accepts material nature as the potency of the Lord and thusessentially real. The example may be given that modeling clay is shaped by achild into various playful forms such as tigers, men or houses. The modelingclay is real, whereas the temporary shapes it assumes are illusory, not beingactual tigers, men or houses. Similarly, the entire cosmic manifestation ismodeling clay in the hands of the Supreme Lord, who acts through mäyä toshape the glaring temporary forms of illusion, which absorb the minds of thosewho are not devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="First">A conditioned soul desires to lord it over material nature and thus criticizesanother conditioned soul whom he considers inferior. Similarly, one praises asuperior materialist because one aspires to that superior position, in which onemay dominate others. Praising and criticizing other materialistic people arethus directly or indirectly based on envy of other living entities and cause oneto fall down from sva-artha, one's real self-interest, Kåñëa consciousness.The words asaty abhiniveçataù, "by absorption in the temporary, or unreal,"indicate that one should not adopt a concept of material duality and praise orcriticize other materialistic persons. Rather, one should praise the puredevotees of the Supreme Lord and criticize the mentality of rebellion againstthe Personality of Godhead, by which one becomes a nondevotee. One shouldnot criticize a low-class materialist, thinking that a high-class materialist isnice. In other words, one should distinguish between the material and thespiritual and should not become absorbed in good and bad on the materialplatform. For example, an honest citizen distinguishes between the life of civilfreedom and that of imprisonment, whereas a foolish prisoner distinguishesbetween comfortable and uncomfortable prison cells. Just as for a free citizenany situation in prison is unacceptable, for a liberated, Kåñëa conscious devotee any material position is unappealing.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura indicates that rather than tryingto separate conditioned souls by materialistic distinctions, one should bringthem together to chant the holy names of the Lord and propagate thesaìkértana movement of Lord Caitanya. A nondevotee, or even an enviousthird-class devotee, is not interested in uniting people on the platform of loveof Godhead. Instead he unnecessarily separates them by emphasizing materialdistinctions like "communist," "capitalist," "black," "white," "rich," "poor,""liberal," "conservative" and so on. Material life is always imperfect, full ofignorance and disappointing in the end. Rather than praising and criticizingthe high and low features of ignorance, one should be absorbed in Kåñëaconsciousness, on the spiritual platform of eternity, bliss and knowledge.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The actual truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, from whomeverything emanates, by whom everything is maintained, and in whomeverything merges to rest. Material nature is the reflection of the AbsoluteTruth, and by the interaction of the material modes of nature the innumerablevarieties of matter appear to be separate, independent truths. Mäyä, illusion,distracts the conditioned soul from the Absolute Truth and absorbs his mindin the glaring manifestation of matter, which ultimately is nondifferent fromthe Absolute Truth, being an emanation from Him. The sense of good and badas separate from the Supreme Lord is like the good and bad dreamsexperienced by a sleeping person. Good and bad dreams are equally unreal.Similarly, material good and evil have no permanent existence separate from the Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="First">The Supreme Lord is the well-wisher of every living entity, and thereforeexecution of His order is good, whereas disobeying His order is bad. Lord Kåñëahas created a perfect social and occupational system calledvarëäçrama-dharma, and the Lord has further given perfect spiritualknowledge in Bhagavad-gétä and other literatures. Execution of Lord Kåñëa'sorder will bring complete social, psychological, political, economic andspiritual success to human society. We should not foolishly look for so-calledgood outside the orders of the Personality of Godhead. Such orders are calledthe laws of God and constitute the essence, or substance, of religion.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Although shadows, echoes and mirages are only illusory reflections of real things, such reflections do cause a semblance of meaningful or comprehensible perception. In the same way, although the identification of the conditioned soul with the material body, mind and ego is illusory, this identification generates fear within him even up to the moment of death.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Although shadows, echoes and mirages are mere reflections of realsubstances, they create strong emotions in persons falsely accepting them asreal. In the same manner, a conditioned soul is seized by such emotions as fear,lust, anger and hope because of his illusory perception of himself as thematerial body, mind and false ego. By practical example it is thus shown thateven illusory objects may cause highly emotional reactions. Ultimately ouremotions should be absorbed in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who iseternal truth. Fear is forever vanquished when one takes shelter of the Lord'slotus feet. One can then enjoy the pure emotions of liberated life.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The Supersoul alone is the ultimate controller and creator of this world, and thus He alone is also the created. Similarly, the Soul of all existence Himself both maintains and is maintained, withdraws and is withdrawn. No other entity can be properly ascertained as separate from Him, the Supreme Soul, who nonetheless is distinct from everything and everyone else. The appearance of the threefold material nature, which is perceived within Him, has no actual basis. Rather, you should understand that this material nature, composed of the three modes, is simply the product of His illusory potency.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Absolute Truth, Lord Çré Kåñëa, expands His external potency andthus creates the material cosmos. As with the sun globe and its expanded rays,the Lord and His expanded potency are simultaneously one and different.Although to conditioned souls material duality seems to be based on the modesof nature, the entire material manifestation is actually nondifferent from theLord and is of one ultimately spiritual nature. The modes of nature createsense objects, demigods, human beings, animals, friends, enemies and so forth.But in reality, everything is simply an expansion of the potency of the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="First">Foolishly, the conditioned soul tries to lord it over material nature, but theLord Himself, being nondifferent from that nature, is its only true proprietor.In several places the Çrémad-Bhägavatam has given the example of the spiderspinning its web by expanding thread from its own mouth. Similarly, throughHis own potency the Lord manifests the material world, maintains it andeventually withdraws it within Himself. Although the Lord is the uniqueSupreme Personality of Godhead, above everyone and everything, He issimultaneously and inconceivably nondifferent from everything. Therefore itis the Lord Himself who is manifested when the Lord creates, it is the LordHimself who is maintained when the Lord maintains, and it is the LordHimself who is withdrawn at the time of annihilation.Although the Lord is nondifferent from both His spiritual abode and Hismaterial creation, still the spiritual abode, Vaikuëöha, is always superior to thematerial manifestation. Both matter and spirit are energies of the Lord, yet thespiritual energy is molded into the eternal forms of bliss and knowledge,whereas the temporary forms of matter are symbols of ignorance andfrustration for the conditioned souls who covet them. The Supreme Lord isHimself the reservoir of all pleasure and is thus dear to His devotees. Thepresumption that the Lord cannot give us complete pleasure is due to ourmisidentifying Him as a product of the material modes of nature. As a result,we pursue false happiness in the deadly embrace of mäyä and thus deviate from our eternal loving relationship with Lord Kåñëa.</div>

<div class="First">False ego is the pure soul's illusory identification with the subtle materialmind and the gross material body. As a result of this illusory identification, theconditioned soul feels lamentation for things lost, jubilation over thingsgained, fear of things inauspicious, anger at the frustration of his desires, andgreed for sense gratification. And so, bewildered by such false attractions andaversions, the conditioned soul must accept further material bodies, whichmeans he must undergo repeated births and deaths. One who is self-realizedknows that all such mundane emotions have nothing to do with the pure soul,whose natural propensity is to engage in the loving service of the Lord.</div>

Liberation is notan impersonal experience; liberation is attainment of one's eternal body,senses, mind and intelligence in the association of the Personality of Godhead.We can revive our eternal, liberated personality, free from the contaminationof false ego, by dedicating ourselves to the loving service of the Lord in Kåñëaconsciousness.

Sannyäsés,especially, should remove the knot of lust from their hearts and should avoidfalling into the clutches of flattering followers or female disciples sent by thedemigods to expose a so-called spiritual leader who is imperfect in Kåñëa conscious knowledge.</div>

<div class="Translation"> An ordinary living entity performs material work and is transformed by the reaction to such work.

Thus the reactions of fruitive work bind onemore and more in the cycle of material defeat. But a learned person, one whois in touch with the Supreme Lord within his heart, realizes the ultimatefrustration of material work and the danger of entering the womb of a pig ordog in a future life as the result of sinful activities. One on the platform ofself-realization does not regard himself as an enjoyer of the world.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">As explained in verse 33 of this chapter, the eternal self is neither assumednor lost, since every living entity is an eternal reality. The word vikalpa, or"duality," here refers to the mistaken idea that the spirit soul is partlycomposed of matter in the form of the gross body or subtle mind. It is thus thatfoolish persons consider the material body or mind to be an intrinsic orfundamental component of the self. In fact the living entity is pure spirit,without any tinge of matter. Consequently the false ego, which is generated bythe false identification with matter, is a mistaken identity imposed upon thepure spirit soul. The sense of ego, or "I am" in other words, the sense of one'sindividual identity—comes from the spirit soul, because there is no otherpossible basis for such self-awareness. By studying one's false sense of ego, onecan analytically understand that there is a pure ego, which is expressed by thewords ahaà brahmäsmi(97), "I am pure spirit soul." One can easily understandin a similar way that there is a supreme spirit soul, the Personality of Godhead,who is the omniscient controller of everything. Such understanding in Kåñëaconsciousness constitutes perfect knowledge, as described here by the Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Material names and forms, subject as they are to creation and annihilation,have no permanent existence and so do not constitute essential, fundamentalprinciples of reality. The material world consists of variegated transformationsof the potency of God. Although God is real and His potency is real, theparticular forms and names that temporarily or circumstantially appear haveno ultimate reality. Gross ignorance occurs when the conditioned soulimagines himself to be material or a mixture of matter and spirit. Somephilosophers argue that the eternal soul in contact with matter is permanentlytransformed and that the false ego represents a new and permanent reality ofthe soul. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé replies that spirit is the living, superior energy ofthe Lord, whereas matter is the inferior, unconscious energy of the Lord, andthat these two energies thus possess opposite qualities, as with light anddarkness. The superior living entity and inferior matter therefore cannotpossibly merge into a common existence, since they eternally possess oppositeand incompatible characteristics. The hallucination of a mixture of matter andspirit is called illusion; it becomes specifically manifest as false ego, whichidentifies with a specific material body or mind created by illusion. Clearlythose scientists or philosophers who are embedded in gross ignorance cannotbe real scientists and philosophers. The simple criterion of spiritualself-awareness unfortunately eliminates a huge percentage of modern so-calledscientists and philosophers, who bury their foolish noses in the Lord's materialenergy, without any knowledge of or interest in the Lord Himself.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, the Supreme Lord has briefly describedto Uddhava the essential wisdom of all the Upaniñads, with the conclusionthat pure devotional service to the Lord is the real means of ultimateliberation. In this regard Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura emphasizesthat although haöha-yogés and räja-yogés try to make progress along theirprescribed paths, they confront obstacles and often fail to achieve their desiredgoals. However, one who surrenders to the Supreme Lord will certainly bevictorious on his spiritual path back home, back to Godhead.Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Twenty-eighth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Jïäna-yoga."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">29. Bhakti-yoga</div>
<div class="First">Thinking that the previously described spiritual practice, based ondetachment, is too difficult, Uddhava inquired about an easier method. Inreply, Lord Çré Kåñëa gave brief instructions on devotional service.The fruitive workers and mystic yogés, who are bewildered by the illusoryenergy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and puffed up by their falseidentifications, refuse to take shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord. Butthe swanlike men, those who know how to discriminate between the essentialand nonessential, always take shelter at the lotus feet of the Personality ofGodhead. The Supreme Lord Himself-within the living entity as thecaittya-guru and without as the spiritual master who teaches byexample-eradicates all the misfortune of the spirit soul and reveals His own personal form.</div>
<div class="First">One should execute all duties for the sake of the Supreme Personality ofGodhead, keeping one's mind absorbed in Him. One should take advantage ofthe sacred abodes of the Lord, where His devotees reside, and one should servethe Lord and celebrate the festivals and holidays in His honor. Byunderstanding all living beings to be Lord Kåñëa's place of residence, one canattain the ability to see equally everywhere, and thus all faulty qualities ofenvy, false ego and so on will be removed. Bearing this in mind, the devoteeshould give up his proud relatives, his separatist outlook and his mundaneembarrassment and should offer obeisances flat on the ground to all, even thedogs and outcastes. As long as one has not learned to see the presence of theSupreme Personality of Godhead in all creatures, he must continue to use hisbody, mind and speech to worship the Supreme Lord in that manner of offering full obeisances to all.</div>
<div class="First">Because this eternal process of devotional service to the Supreme Lord istranscendental and has been established by the Lord Himself, it can never, tothe slightest extent, be defeated or prove fruitless. When one offers himselfcompletely to the Supreme Lord with exclusive devotion, the Lord becomesparticularly pleased, and thus the devotee achieves immortality, becomingqualified to obtain opulence equal to that of the Lord.After receiving these instructions, Çré Uddhava went to Badarikäçrama inpursuance of Lord Kåñëa's order, and by perfectly carrying out the instructionsof the Supreme Lord, he attained the Lord's transcendental abode. Byfaithfully serving these instructions spoken by the Personality of Godhead toUddhava, the greatest of devotees, the entire world can become liberated.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Therefore, O lotus-eyed Lord of the universe, swanlike men happily take shelter of Your lotus feet, the source of all transcendental ecstasy.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çré Uddhava emphasizes here that one can achieve spiritual perfectionsimply by taking shelter of the Personality of Godhead. Those who do so arecalled haàsäù, the most discriminating human beings, since they are able tolocate the actual source of spiritual happiness, the Lord's lotus feet. The wordyoga-karmabhiù indicates that those who are attracted to or proud ofachievements in the field of mystic yoga or ordinary material endeavor cannotappreciate the great advantage of obediently surrendering to the SupremePersonality of Godhead. Generally the yogés and fruitive workers are proud oftheir so-called achievements and are more attracted to their own endeavorthan to the Lord Himself. By humbly taking shelter of Lord Kåñëa, one canadvance easily and quickly on the path of Kåñëa consciousness and go back home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The devotees of the Lord become completely successful by the Lord'scauseless mercy. Sometimes Lord Kåñëa accepts a position of subservience toHis great devotees, as with Nanda Mahäräja, the gopés, Bali Mahäräja andothers. Although demigods like Lord Brahmä were standing in line to touchtheir helmets to the Lord's foot cushion, still Lord Rämacandra awarded Hismost intimate friendship to subhumans, such as the monkeys headed byHanumän. Similarly Lord Kåñëa's affection for the deer and cows, and even forthe trees of Våndävana, is well known. Further, the Lord gladly drove thechariot of Arjuna and acted as the messenger and faithful subordinate of KingYudhiñöhira. Such devotees have no need for the elaborate jïäna-yoga systemsor the process for achieving mystic powers. All these devotees are representedhere by Çré Uddhava, who frankly informs the Lord that the sophisticatedsystems of philosophical speculation and mystic yoga are not appealing for onewho has developed a taste for direct loving service to the Lord.</div>

<div class="First">As described in this chapter, one who desires personal prestige in the Lord'sservice cannot be considered intelligent and clever. Similarly, one who isanxious to become a sophisticated transcendental philosopher is not the mostintelligent. Nor is one who is expert in accumulating money. The Lord herestates that the most intelligent and clever person is the devotee who offers histemporary, illusory material body and possessions to Him with love andwithout personal motivation. The devotee thus obtains the eternal AbsoluteTruth. In other words, real intelligence is to actually surrender to Lord Kåñëa,without personal desire or duplicity. That is the Lord's opinion.</div>

Uddhava's lamentation arosebecause he thought himself separated from Lord Kåñëa. Actually, Çré Uddhavais an eternally liberated soul, but the Lord placed him in bewilderment andlamentation so that this supreme knowledge of the Uddhava-géta could bespoken. Lord Kåñëa's question here indicates that if Uddhava had not perfectlyunderstood this knowledge, Lord Kåñëa would have explained the same thingagain. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, since Çré Uddhavais the intimate friend of Lord Kåñëa, the Lord's question here was in a friendly,playful spirit.

<div class="Translation"> The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Uddhava, take My order and go to My äçrama called Badarikä. Purify yourself by both touching and also bathing in the holy waters there, which have emanated from My lotus feet. Rid yourself of all sinful reactions with the sight of the sacred Alakanandä River. Dress yourself in bark and eat whatever is naturally available in the forest. Thus you should remain content and free from desire, tolerant of all dualities, good-natured, self-controlled, peaceful and endowed with transcendental knowledge and realization. With fixed attention, meditate constantly upon these instructions I have imparted to you and assimilate their essence. Fix your words and thoughts upon Me, and always endeavor to increase your realization of My transcendental qualities. In this way you will cross beyond the destinations of the three modes of nature and finally come back to Me.</div>

Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé thus concludes by offering his obeisances to thespiritual master of the entire universe, Lord Çré Kåñëa.Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Twenty-ninth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Bhakti-yoga."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">30. The Disappearance of the Yadu Dynasty</div>
<div class="First">This chapter discusses the destruction of the Yadu dynasty in connectionwith the winding up of the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.After Çré Uddhava left for Badarikäçrama, Lord Çré Kåñëa, taking note ofmany bad omens, advised the Yädavas to abandon Dvärakä and go to Prabhäsa,on the bank of the Sarasvaté, to perform svasty-ayana and other rituals forcounteracting bad fortune. They followed His advice and went to Prabhäsa.There they became absorbed in festivity, and by the illusory power of LordKåñëa they became intoxicated from drinking liquor. Thus losing theirintelligence, they quarreled among themselves and began killing one another, until not a man was left alive.</div>
<div class="First">Afterward, Çré Baladeva went to the shore of the ocean and by the mysticstrength of yoga gave up His body. Seeing the disappearance of Baladeva, LordÇré Kåñëa sat down silently upon the ground. Then a hunter named Jarä,mistaking the sole of the Lord's left foot for a deer, pierced it with an arrow.The hunter immediately understood his mistake and, falling at the feet of LordÇré Kåñëa, begged to be punished. In reply Lord Kåñëa told the hunter thatwhat he had done was actually according to His own desire. The Lord then sent the hunter to Vaikuëöha.</div>
<div class="First">When Däruka, Kåñëa's charioteer, arrived on the scene and saw Lord Kåñëain that condition, he began to lament. Kåñëa told him that he should go toDvärakä, inform the residents about the annihilation of the Yadu dynasty, andadvise them all to leave Dvärakä for Indraprastha. Däruka obediently carried out this order.</div>

<div class="First">Parékñit Mahäräja now inquires from Çukadeva Gosvämé about the topic ofChapter One of this canto, namely the annihilation of the Yadu dynasty andLord Kåñëa's return to the spiritual sky. Because Lord Kåñëa was playing thepart of an ordinary member of the Yadu dynasty, He appeared to react to thecurse of the brähmaëas by giving up His earthly pastimes. Lord Kåñëa cannotactually be cursed by anyone. Närada Muni and the other sages who cursed theYadu dynasty are eternal devotees of Lord Kåñëa and could hardly curse Him.Therefore, in giving up His pastimes and leaving the earth with the Yadudynasty, Lord Kåñëa demonstrated His internal potency and personal will,since no one can challenge the supreme potency of the Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Once their eyes were fixed upon His transcendental form, women were unable to withdraw them, and once that form had entered the ears of the sages and become fixed in their hearts, it would never depart. What to speak of acquiring fame, the great poets who described the beauty of the Lord's form would have their words invested with transcendentally pleasing attraction. And by seeing that form on Arjuna's chariot, all the warriors on the battlefield of Kurukñetra attained the liberation of gaining a spiritual body similar to the Lord's.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Transcendental, liberated personalities such as the gopés of Våndävana andRukmiëé, the original goddess of fortune, were constantly meditating on theLord's spiritual body. Great liberated sages (satäm), having heard about LordKåñëa's body, could not take it out of their hearts. The Lord's bodily beautyexpanded the love and poetic output of great liberated poets, and simply byseeing Lord Kåñëa's body, the warriors at Kurukñetra achieved spiritualliberation with an eternal body similar to the Lord's. Therefore it is impossibleto imagine Lord Kåñëa's eternal form of bliss to be in any way material. Thosewho imagine that Lord Kåñëa gave up His eternal form are certainly bewildered by the Lord's illusory energy.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has given a great amount of evidencefrom the Vedic literatures proving that the humanlike form of the Personalityof Godhead and His holy name, abode, paraphernalia and associates are alleternal, spiritual manifestations without any tinge of material contamination.(See Appendix). In this regard the äcärya has further explained that becausethe living entities must suffer the reactions to their sinful activities, the Lordarranges for them to be punished during the Kali-yuga. In other words, it is notLord Kåñëa's desire that conditioned souls be sinful and suffer, but since theyare already sinful, the Lord creates an appropriate age during which they can experience the bitter fruits of irreligiosity.</div>
<div class="First">Since Lord Kåñëa personally establishes religious principles in His variousappearances in this material world, at the end of Dväpara-yuga religion on theearth was overwhelmingly powerful. All the significant demons had beenkilled; the great sages, saints and devotees had been greatly encouraged,enlightened and fortified; and there was little scope for irreligion. Had LordKåñëa ascended to the spiritual sky in His spiritual body before the eyes of theworld, it would have been very difficult for Kali-yuga to flourish. Lord Kåñëaleft the world in exactly that way during His appearance as Rämacandra, andhundreds of thousands of years later, hundreds of millions of pious persons stilldiscuss this wonderful pastime of the Lord. To pave the way for Kali-yuga,however, Lord Kåñëa left this world in a way that puzzles those who are not His staunch devotees.</div>
<div class="First">The eternal form of the Lord is described throughout Vedic literature, andHis eternal form constitutes the highest understanding of the Absolute Truthaccording to all great äcäryas, including Çaìkaräcärya and CaitanyaMahäprabhu. Yet although Lord Kåñëa's eternal, spiritual form is a realized factfor advanced devotees, for those who are weak in Kåñëa consciousness theinconceivable pastimes and plan of the Lord are sometimes hard to appreciate properly.</div>

<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains that the fratricidal battle ofthe Yadu dynasty and the hunter's attack upon Lord Kåñëa are clearlyactivities of the Lord's internal potency for the purpose of fulfilling the Lord'spastime desires. According to the evidence, the quarrel among the members ofthe Yadu dynasty occurred at sunset; then the Lord sat down on the bank ofthe Sarasvaté River. It is stated that a hunter then arrived with the intentionof killing a deer, but it is highly unlikely—when more than 560 millionwarriors had just been killed in a great uproarious battle and the place hadbeen flooded with blood and strewn with corpses—that a simple hunter wouldsomehow come along trying to kill a deer. Since deer are by nature fearful andtimid, how could any deer possibly be on the scene of such a huge battle, andhow could a hunter calmly go about his business in the midst of such carnage?Therefore, the withdrawal of the Yadu dynasty and Lord Kåñëa's owndisappearance from this earth were not material historical events; they wereinstead a display of the Lord's internal potency for the purpose of winding up His manifest pastimes on earth.</div>

<div class="Chapnum">31. The Disappearance of Lord Çré Kåñëa</div>
<div class="First">This chapter describes the return of the Supreme Personality of Godhead to His own abode, along with all the Yadus.</div>
<div class="First">Upon learning from Däruka that Lord Çré Kåñëa had returned to His abode,Vasudeva and all the others remaining in Dvärakä became very much agitatedby lamentation and went out from the city to find Him. All the demigods who,in pursuance of the desire of Lord Kåñëa, had taken birth in the Yadu dynastyto render assistance in His pastimes followed Lord Kåñëa and returned to theirrespective abodes. The Lord's activities of creating a life for Himself and thendismantling it are simply tricks of Mäyä, like an actor's performance. Actually,He creates the entire universe, and then He enters within it as the Supersoul.In the end, He again winds up the entire universe within Himself and,remaining in His private glory, desists from external pastimes.Though overcome by feelings of separation from Kåñëa, Arjuna wasnevertheless able to pacify himself by remembering all the various instructionsgiven to him by the Lord. Arjuna then carried out the rituals of offering piëòaand so on for his dead relatives. At that time the ocean swallowed up all ofDvärakä-puré except for the Lord's own residence. Arjuna took the remainingmembers of the Yadu dynasty to Indraprastha, where he installed Vajra uponthe throne. Hearing of these events, the Päëòavas, led by Yudhiñöhira, placedParékñit upon their throne and left for the great journey.</div>

The worddhäraëä-dhyäna-maìgalam indicates that those trying for spiritual elevationthrough meditation and yoga achieve all auspiciousness through meditation onthe Lord's body. Since yogés are liberated simply by thinking of Lord Kåñëa'sbody, that body is certainly not material and therefore not subject to burning by mundane mystic fire or any other type of fire.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura reminds us of Lord Kåñëa's statementin the Eleventh Canto, Chapter Fourteen, verse 37: vahni-madhye smaredrüpaà mamaitad dhyäna-maìgalam. "Within the fire one should meditate uponMy form, which is the auspicious object of all meditation." Since Lord Kåñëa'stranscendental form is present within fire as the maintaining principle, howcan fire affect that form? Thus although the Lord appeared to enter the mysticyoga trance, the word adagdhvä indicates that the Lord, since His body ispurely spiritual, bypassed the formality of burning and directly entered Hisown abode in the spiritual sky. This point has also been elaborately explainedby Çréla Jéva Gosvämé in his commentary to this verse.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear King, you should understand that the Supreme Lord's appearance and disappearance, which resemble those of embodied conditioned souls, are actually a show enacted by His illusory energy, just like the performance of an actor. After creating this universe He enters into it, plays within it for some time, and at last winds it up. Then the Lord remains situated in His own transcendental glory, having ceased from the functions of cosmic manifestation.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the so-called fight among the members ofthe Yadu dynasty was actually a display of the pastime potency of the Lord,since Lord Kåñëa's personal associates are never subject to ordinary birth anddeath like conditioned souls. This being the case, certainly the SupremePersonality of Godhead Himself is transcendental to material birth and death, as clearly stated in this verse.</div>
<div class="First">The word naöasya, "of an actor or magician," is significant here. ÇrélaViçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura tells the following story of a certain magician who exhibits the trick of dying:</div>
<div class="First">"In front of a great king, a magician approaches a stack of valuablegarments, jewels, coins and so forth, all placed there by the king. Taking ajeweled necklace, the magician tells the king, 'Now I am taking this necklace,and you can't have it,' and he makes the necklace disappear. 'Now I'm takingthis gold coin, and you can't have it,' he says, and makes the gold coindisappear. Next, challenging the king in the same way, the magician makesseven thousand horses disappear. Then the magician creates the illusion thatthe king's children, grandchildren, brothers and other family members haveattacked each other and that nearly all are dead from the violent quarrel. Theking hears the magician speaking and at the same time observes these thingstaking place before him as he sits in the great assembly hall."Then the magician says, 'O King, I no longer wish to live. Just as I havestudied magic, so also, by the mercy of the lotus feet of my guru, I have learnedthe mystic meditation of yoga. One is supposed to give up one's body whilemeditating in a holy place, and since you have performed so many piousactivities, you are a holy place yourself. Therefore I shall now give up my body.'"Thus speaking, the magician sits down in the proper yoga posture, fixeshimself in präëäyäma, pratyähära, dhäraëä, dhyäna and samädhi and becomessilent. A moment later, a fire generated from his trance blazes forth out of hisbody and burns it to ashes. Then all the wives of the magician, distraught with lamentation, enter into that fire.</div>
<div class="First">"Three or four days later, after the magician has returned to his ownprovince, he sends one of his daughters to the king. The daughter tells him, 'OKing, I have just come to your palace, bringing along with me, invisibly, allyour sons, grandsons and brothers in good health—along with all the jewelsand other items given by you. Please, therefore, give me whatever you considerfitting remuneration for the wisdom of the magic that has been exhibitedbefore you.' In this way, even by ordinary magic one can simulate birth and death."</div>
<div class="First">It is not difficult to understand, therefore, that the Supreme Personality ofGodhead, although transcendental to the laws of nature, exhibits His illusorypotency so that ordinary fools will think the Lord has left His body like ahuman being. Actually, Lord Kåñëa returned to His abode in His own eternal body, as confirmed throughout the Vedic literature.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Lord Kåñëa brought the son of His guru back from the planet of the lord of death in the boy's selfsame body, and as the ultimate giver of protection He saved you also when you were burned by the brahmästra of Açvatthämä. He conquered in battle even Lord Çiva, who deals death to the agents of death, and He sent the hunter Jarä directly to Vaikuëöha in his human body. How could such a personality be unable to protect His own Self?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">To mitigate his own and Parékñit Mahäräja's distress at the narration ofLord Kåñëa's departure from this world, Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé here givesseveral clear examples proving that Lord Kåñëa is far beyond the influence ofdeath. Although the son of Lord Kåñëa's spiritual master (Sändépani Muni)had been taken by death, the Lord brought him back in his same body.Similarly, the power of Brahman cannot touch Lord Kåñëa, since ParékñitMahäräja, though burned by the brahmästra weapon, was easily saved by theLord. Lord Çiva was clearly defeated by Lord Kåñëa in the battle withBäëäsura, and the hunter Jarä was sent to a Vaikuëöha planet in his samehuman body. Death is an insignificant expansion of Lord Kåñëa's externalpotency and cannot possibly act upon the Lord Himself. Those who actuallyunderstand the transcendental nature of Lord Kåñëa's activities will find convincing evidence in these examples.</div>

<div class="First">"There Yudhiñöhira saw Lord Govinda as the Absolute Truth in His original,personal form. He appeared just as Yudhiñöhira had seen Him before, with allthe same characteristics. He was glowing brilliantly with the effulgencecoming from His own body, and He was surrounded by His transcendentalweapons—the disc and so on—which appeared in their fearsome personifiedforms. O descendant of Kunté, Lord Madhusüdana was being worshiped by theeffulgent hero Arjuna, who also appeared in his original form. When these twolions among men, who are worshipable by the demigods, noticed the presenceof Yudhiñöhira, they approached him with proper respect and offered him worship."</div>

<div class="First">Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains that whereas the external manifestation of theLord's abode was covered by the ocean, the Lord's eternal Dvärakä existsbeyond the material universe and certainly beyond the material ocean.Dvärakä had been constructed by Viçvakarmä, the architect of the demigods,and the Sudharmä assembly hall had been brought from heaven. In that citythere were many beautiful and splendorous residences of the aristocratic Yadudynasty, and the most beautiful residence of all was that of the SupremePersonality of Godhead. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé mentions that even in the modernage, people who live near the site of the original Dvärakä sometimes catch aglimpse of it in the ocean. Ultimately, the Lord's associates and abode areeternal, and one who understands this is qualified to become fully Kåñëa conscious.</div>
