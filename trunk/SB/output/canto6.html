<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Throughout <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> there are descriptions of ten subject matters, including creation, subsequent creation and the planetary systems. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, the speaker of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> has already described creation, subsequent creation and the planetary systems in the Third, Fourth and Fifth Cantos. Now, in this Sixth Canto, which consists of nineteen chapters, he will describe <span class="Italic">po&#7779;a&#7751;a,</span> or protection by the Lord.</div>
</div><A NAME="75027"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The first chapter relates the history of Aj&#257;mila, who was considered a greatly sinful man, but was liberated when four order carriers of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u came to rescue him from the hands of the order carriers of Yamar&#257;ja. A full description of how he was liberated, having been relieved of the reactions of his sinful life, is given in this chapter. Sinful activities are painful both in this life and in the next. We should know for certain that the cause of all painful life is sinful action. On the path of fruitive work one certainly commits sinful activities, and therefore according to the considerations of <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a,</span> different types of atonement are recommended. Such methods of atonement, however, do not free one from ignorance, which is the root of sinful life. Consequently one is prone to commit sinful activities even after atonement, which is therefore very inadequate for purification. On the path of speculative knowledge one becomes free from sinful life by understanding things as they are. Therefore the acquirement of speculative knowledge is also considered a method of atonement. While performing fruitive activities one can become free from the actions of sinful life through austerity, penance, celibacy, control of the mind and senses, truthfulness and the practice of mystic <span class="Italic">yoga.</span> By awakening knowledge one may also neutralize sinful reactions. Neither of these methods, however, can free one from the tendency to commit sinful activities.</div>
</div><A NAME="75028"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">By <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> one can completely avoid the tendency for sinful life; other methods are not very feasible. Therefore the Vedic literature concludes that devotional service is more important than the methods of <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</span> and <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a.</span> Only the path of devotional service is auspicious for everyone. Fruitive activities and speculative knowledge cannot independently liberate anyone, but devotional service, independent of <span class="Italic">karma</span> and <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na,</span> is so potent that one who has fixed his mind at the lotus feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is guaranteed not to meet the Yamad&#363;tas, the order carriers of Yamar&#257;ja, even in dreams.</div>
</div><A NAME="75029"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">To prove the strength of devotional service, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; described the history of Aj&#257;mila. Aj&#257;mila was a resident of K&#257;nyakubja (the modern Kanauj). He was trained by his parents to become a perfect <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> by studying the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and following the regulative principles, but because of his past, this youthful <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> was somehow attracted by a prostitute, and because of her association he became most fallen and abandoned all regulative principles. Aj&#257;mila begot in the womb of the prostitute ten sons, the last of whom was called N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. At the time of Aj&#257;mila&rsquo;s death, when the order carriers of Yamar&#257;ja came to take him, he loudly called the name N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a in fear because he was attached to his youngest son. Thus he remembered the original N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Although he did not chant the holy name of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a completely offenselessly, it acted nevertheless. As soon as he chanted the holy name of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, the order carriers of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u immediately appeared on the scene. A discussion ensued between the order carriers of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and those of Yamar&#257;ja, and by hearing that discussion Aj&#257;mila was liberated. He could then understand the bad effect of fruitive activities and could also understand how exalted is the process of devotional service.</div>

<div class="Translation">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it said: O my lord, O &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, you have already described [in the Second Canto] the path of liberation [niv&#7771;tti-m&#257;rga]. By following that path, one is certainly elevated gradually to the highest planetary system, Brahmaloka, from which one is promoted to the spiritual world along with Lord Brahm&#257;. Thus one&rsquo;s repetition of birth and death in the material world ceases.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Since Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, when he heard the description, at the end of the Fifth Canto, of the different hellish conditions of life, he was very much concerned with how to liberate the conditioned souls from the clutches of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> and take them back home, back to Godhead. Therefore he reminded his spiritual master, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, about the <span class="Italic">niv&#7771;tti-m&#257;rga,</span> or path of liberation, which he had described in the Second Canto. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, who at the time of death was fortunate to have met &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, inquired from &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; about the path of liberation at that crucial time. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; very much appreciated his question and congratulated him by saying:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">var&#299;y&#257;n e&#7779;a te pra&#347;na&#7717;<br>k&#7771;to loka-hita&#7745; n&#7771;pa<br>&#257;tmavit-sammata&#7717; pu&#7745;s&#257;&#7745;<br>&#347;rotavy&#257;di&#7779;u ya&#7717; para&#7717;</div>
</div><A NAME="75046"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;My dear King, your question is glorious because it is very beneficial for all kinds of people. The answer to this question is the prime subject matter for hearing, and it is approved by all transcendentalists.&rdquo; (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="index5167.html?g=13320">2.1.1</a>)</div>
<div class="Purport">Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was astonished that the living entities in the conditional stage do not accept the path of liberation, devotional service, instead of suffering in so many hellish conditions. This is the symptom of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. <span class="Italic">V&#257;&ntilde;ch&#257;-kalpa-tarubhya&#347; ca k&#7771;p&#257;-sindhubhya eva ca:</span> a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is an ocean of mercy. <span class="Italic">Para-du&#7717;kha-du&#7717;kh&#299;:</span> he is unhappy because of the unhappiness of others. Therefore Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, being compassionate toward the conditioned souls suffering in hellish life, suggested that &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; continue describing the path of liberation, which he had explained in the beginning of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> The word <span class="Italic">asa&#7745;s&#7771;ti</span> is very important in this connection. <span class="Italic">Sa&#7745;s&#7771;ti</span> refers to continuing on the path of birth and death. <span class="Italic">Asa&#7745;s&#7771;ti,</span> on the contrary, refers to <span class="Italic">niv&#7771;tti-m&#257;rga,</span> or the path of liberation, by which one&rsquo;s birth and death cease and one gradually progresses to Brahmaloka, unless one is a pure devotee who does not care about going to the higher planetary systems, in which case one immediately returns home, back to Godhead, by executing devotional service (<span class="Italic">tyaktv&#257; deha&#7745; punar janma naiti</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexe89d.html?g=1505">4.9</a>]). Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, therefore, was very eager to hear from &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; about the path of liberation for the conditioned soul.</div>
<div class="Purport">According to the opinion of the <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas,</span> the word <span class="Italic">krama-yogopalabdhena</span> indicates that by first performing <span class="Italic">karma-yoga</span> and then <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na-yoga</span> and finally coming to the platform of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> one can be liberated. <span class="Italic">Bhakti-yoga,</span> however, is so powerful that it does not depend on <span class="Italic">karma-yoga</span> or <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na-yoga.</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti-yoga</span> itself is so powerful that even an impious man with no assets in <span class="Italic">karma-yoga</span> or an illiterate with no assets in <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na-yoga</span> can undoubtedly be elevated to the spiritual world if he simply adheres to <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> <span class="Italic">M&#257;m evai&#7779;yasy asa&#7745;&#347;aya&#7717;.</span> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexb639.html?g=2796">8.7</a>) that by the process of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> one undoubtedly goes back to Godhead, back home to the spiritual world. <span class="Italic">Yog&#299;s,</span> however, instead of going directly to the spiritual world, sometimes want to see other planetary systems, and therefore they ascend to the planetary system where Lord Brahm&#257; lives, as indicated here by the word <span class="Italic">brahma&#7751;&#257;.</span> At the time of dissolution, Lord Brahm&#257;, along with all the inhabitants of Brahmaloka, goes directly to the spiritual world.

<div class="Translation">My dear lord, you have described the dynasties and characteristics of King Priyavrata and King Utt&#257;nap&#257;da. The Supreme Personality of Godhead created this material world with various universes, planetary systems, planets and stars, with varied lands, seas, oceans, mountains, rivers, gardens and trees, all with different characteristics. These are divided among this planet earth, the luminaries in the sky and the lower planetary systems. You have very clearly described these planets and the living entities who live on them.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Here the words <span class="Italic">yathedam as&#7771;jad vibhu&#7717;</span> clearly indicate that the Supreme, the great, almighty Personality of Godhead, created this entire material world with its different varieties of planets, stars and so forth. Atheists try to conceal the hand of God, which is present in every creation, but they cannot explain how all these creations could come into existence without a competent intelligence and almighty power behind them. Simply to imagine or speculate is a waste of time. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index58fa.html?g=3360">10.8</a>), the Lord says, <span class="Italic">aha&#7745; sarvasya prabhavo:</span> &ldquo;I am the origin of everything.&rdquo; <span class="Italic">Matta&#7717; sarva&#7745; pravartate:</span> &ldquo;whatever exists in the creation emanates from Me.&rdquo; <span class="Italic">Iti matv&#257; bhajante m&#257;&#7745; budh&#257; bh&#257;va-samanvit&#257;&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;When one fully understands that I create everything by My omnipotence, one becomes firmly situated in devotional service and fully surrenders at My lotus feet.&rdquo; Unfortunately, the unintelligent cannot immediately understand K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s supremacy.

<div class="Translation">O greatly fortunate and opulent &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, now kindly tell me how human beings may be saved from having to enter hellish conditions in which they suffer terrible pains.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the Twenty-sixth Chapter of the Fifth Canto, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; has explained that people who commit sinful acts are forced to enter hellish planets and suffer. Now Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, being a devotee, is concerned with how this can be stopped. A Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is <span class="Italic">para-du&#7717;kha-du&#7717;kh&#299;;</span> in other words, he has no personal troubles, but he is very unhappy to see others in trouble. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja said, &ldquo;My Lord, I have no personal problems, for I have learned how to glorify Your transcendental qualities and thus enter a trance of ecstasy. I do have a problem, however, for I am simply thinking of these rascals and fools who are busy with <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;-sukha,</span> temporary happiness, without knowledge of devotional service unto You.&rdquo; This is the problem faced by a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. Because a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava fully takes shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he personally has no problems, but because he is compassionate toward the fallen, conditioned souls, he is always thinking of plans to save them from their hellish life in this body and the next. Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, therefore, anxiously wanted to know from &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; how humanity can be saved from gliding down to hell. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; had already explained how people enter hellish life, and he could also explain how they could be saved from it. Intelligent men must take advantage of these instructions. Unfortunately, however, the entire world is lacking K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, and therefore people are suffering from the grossest ignorance and do not even believe in a life after this one. To convince them of their next life is very difficult because they have become almost mad in their pursuit of material enjoyment. Nevertheless, our duty, the duty of all sane men, is to save them. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it is the representative of one who can save them.</div>

<div class="Translation">Therefore, before one&rsquo;s next death comes, as long as one&rsquo;s body is strong enough, one should quickly adopt the process of atonement according to &#347;&#257;stra; otherwise one&rsquo;s time will be lost, and the reactions of his sins will increase. As an expert physician diagnoses and treats a disease according to its gravity, one should undergo atonement according to the severity of one&rsquo;s sins.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The <span class="Italic">dharma-&#347;&#257;stras</span> like the <span class="Italic">Manu-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> prescribe that a man who has committed murder should be hanged and his own life sacrificed in atonement. Previously this system was followed all over the world, but since people are becoming atheists, they are stopping capital punishment. This is not wise. Herein it is said that a physician who knows how to diagnose a disease prescribes medicine accordingly. If the disease is very serious, the medicine must be strong. The weight of a murderer&rsquo;s sin is very great, and therefore according to <span class="Italic">Manu-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> a murderer must be killed. By killing a murderer the government shows mercy to him because if a murderer is not killed in this life, he will be killed and forced to suffer many times in future lives. Since people do not know about the next life and the intricate workings of nature, they manufacture their own laws, but they should properly consult the established injunctions of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> and act accordingly. In India even today the Hindu community often takes advice from expert scholars regarding how to counteract sinful activities. In Christianity also there is a process of confession and atonement. Therefore atonement is required, and atonement must be undergone according to the gravity of one&rsquo;s sinful acts.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it said: One may know that sinful activity is injurious for him because he actually sees that a criminal is punished by the government and rebuked by people in general and because he hears from scriptures and learned scholars that one is thrown into hellish conditions in the next life for committing sinful acts. Nevertheless, in spite of such knowledge, one is forced to commit sins again and again, even after performing acts of atonement. Therefore, what is the value of such atonement?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In some religious sects a sinful man goes to a priest to confess his sinful acts and pay a fine, but then he again commits the same sins and returns to confess them again. This is the practice of a professional sinner. Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s observations indicate that even five thousand years ago it was the practice of criminals to atone for their crimes but then commit the same crimes again, as if forced to do so. Therefore, owing to his practical experience, Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja saw that the process of repeatedly sinning and atoning is pointless. Regardless of how many times he is punished, one who is attached to sense enjoyment will commit sinful acts again and again until he is trained to refrain from enjoying his senses. The word <span class="Italic">viva&#347;a</span> is used herein, indicating that even one who does not want to commit sinful acts will be forced to do so by habit. Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja therefore considered the process of atonement to have little value for saving one from sinful acts. In the following verse he further explains his rejection of this process.</div>

Persons who subject themselves to the rules and regulations of atonement are not at all intelligent. Indeed, they are in the mode of darkness. Unless one is freed from the mode of ignorance, trying to counteract one action through another is useless because this will not uproot one&rsquo;s desires.

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">To concentrate the mind, one must observe a life of celibacy and not fall down. One must undergo the austerity of voluntarily giving up sense enjoyment. One must then control the mind and senses, give charity, be truthful, clean and nonviolent, follow the regulative principles and regularly chant the holy name of the Lord. Thus a sober and faithful person who knows the religious principles is temporarily purified of all sins performed with his body, words and mind. These sins are like the dried leaves of creepers beneath a bamboo tree, which may be burned by fire although their roots remain to grow again at the first opportunity.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"><span class="Italic">Tapa&#7717;</span> is explained in the <span class="Italic">sm&#7771;ti-&#347;&#257;stra</span> as follows: <span class="Italic">manasa&#347; cendriy&#257;&#7751;&#257;&#7745; ca aik&#257;grya&#7745; parama&#7745; tapa&#7717;.</span> &ldquo;Complete control of the mind and senses and their complete concentration on one kind of activity is called <span class="Italic">tapa&#7717;.</span>&rdquo; Our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is teaching people how to concentrate the mind on devotional service. This is first-class <span class="Italic">tapa&#7717;.</span> <span class="Italic">Brahmacarya,</span> the life of celibacy, has eight aspects: one should not think of women, speak about sex life, dally with women, look lustfully at women, talk intimately with women or decide to engage in sexual intercourse, nor should one endeavor for sex life or engage in sex life. One should not even think of women or look at them, to say nothing of talking with them. This is called first-class <span class="Italic">brahmacarya.</span> If a <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> or <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> talks with a woman in a secluded place, naturally there will be a possibility of sex life without anyone&rsquo;s knowledge. Therefore a complete <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> practices just the opposite. If one is a perfect <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;,</span> he can very easily control the mind and senses, give charity, speak truthfully and so forth. To begin, however, one must control the tongue and the process of eating.</div>
<div class="Purport">In the <span class="Italic">bhakti-m&#257;rga,</span> the path of devotional service, one must strictly follow the regulative principles by first controlling the tongue (<span class="Italic">sevonmukhe hi jihv&#257;dau svayam eva sphuraty ada&#7717;</span>). The tongue (<span class="Italic">jihv&#257;</span>) can be controlled if one chants the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra,</span> does not speak of any subjects other than those concerning K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and does not taste anything not offered to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. If one can control the tongue in this way, <span class="Italic">brahmacarya</span> and other purifying processes will automatically follow. It will be explained in the next verse that the path of devotional service is completely perfect and is therefore superior to the path of fruitive activities and the path of knowledge. Quoting from the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> &#346;r&#299;la V&#299;rar&#257;ghava &#256;c&#257;rya explains that austerity involves observing fasts as fully as possible (<span class="Italic">tapas&#257;n&#257;&#347;akena</span>). &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; has also advised that <span class="Italic">aty&#257;h&#257;ra,</span> too much eating, is an impediment to advancement in spiritual life. Also, in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexa646.html?g=2199">6.17</a>) K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says:</div>

Similarly, because the root of sinful desire is not destroyed in the heart of a person who is cultivating knowledge but who has no taste for devotional service, there is a possibility that his sinful desires will reappear.

That is the test of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. Both pious and impious activities are actually due to ignorance because a living entity, as an eternal servant of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, has no need to act for his personal sense gratification. Therefore as soon as one is reclaimed to the platform of devotional service, he relinquishes his attachment for pious and impious activities and is interested only in what will satisfy K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. This process of <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> devotional service to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (<span class="Italic">v&#257;sudeva-par&#257;ya&#7751;a</span>), relieves one from the reactions of all activities.</div>

These reactions generally exist in four phases. Some of them are ready to produce results immediately, some are in the form of seeds, some are unmanifested, and some are current. All such reactions are immediately nullified by devotional service. When devotional service is present in one&rsquo;s heart, desires to perform sinful activities have no place there. Sinful life is due to ignorance, which means forgetfulness of one&rsquo;s constitutional position as an eternal servant of God, but when one is fully K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious he realizes that he is God&rsquo;s eternal servant.</div>
<div class="Purport">In this regard, &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; comments that <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> may be divided into two divisions: (1) <span class="Italic">santat&#257;,</span> devotional service that continues incessantly with faith and love, and (2) <span class="Italic">k&#257;d&#257;citk&#299;,</span> devotional service that does not continue incessantly but is sometimes awakened. Incessantly flowing devotional service (<span class="Italic">santat&#257;</span>) may also be divided into two categories: (1) service performed with slight attachment and (2) spontaneous devotional service. Intermittent devotional service (<span class="Italic">k&#257;d&#257;citk&#299;</span>) may be divided into three categories: (1) <span class="Italic">r&#257;g&#257;bh&#257;samay&#299;,</span> devotional service in which one is almost attached, (2) <span class="Italic">r&#257;g&#257;bh&#257;sa-&#347;&#363;nya-svar&#363;pa-bh&#363;t&#257;,</span> devotional service in which there is no spontaneous love but one likes the constitutional position of serving, and (3) <span class="Italic">&#257;bh&#257;sa-r&#363;p&#257;,</span> a slight glimpse of devotional service. As for atonement, if one has caught even a slight glimpse of devotional service, all needs to undergo <span class="Italic">pr&#257;ya&#347;citta,</span> atonement, are superseded. Therefore atonement is certainly unnecessary when one has achieved spontaneous love and, above that, attachment with love, which are signs of increasing advancement in <span class="Italic">k&#257;d&#257;citk&#299;.</span> Even in the stage of <span class="Italic">&#257;bh&#257;sa-r&#363;p&#257; bhakti,</span> all the reactions of sinful life are uprooted and vanquished. &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; expresses the opinion that the word <span class="Italic">k&#257;rtsnyena</span> means that even if one has a desire to commit sinful actions, the roots of that desire are vanquished merely by <span class="Italic">&#257;bh&#257;sa-r&#363;p&#257; bhakti.</span> The example of <span class="Italic">bh&#257;skara,</span> the sun, is most appropriate. The <span class="Italic">&#257;bh&#257;sa</span> feature of <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is compared to twilight, and the accumulation of one&rsquo;s sinful activities is compared to fog. Since fog does not spread throughout the sky, the sun need do no more than merely manifest its first rays, and the fog immediately disappears. Similarly, if one has even a slight relationship with devotional service, all the fog of his sinful life is immediately vanquished.</div>

<div class="First"><span class="Italic">Tat-puru&#7779;a</span> refers to a preacher of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, such as the spiritual master. &#346;r&#299;la Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura has said, <span class="Italic">ch&#257;&#7693;iy&#257; vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-sev&#257; nist&#257;ra p&#257;yeche keb&#257;:</span> &ldquo;Without serving a bona fide spiritual master, an ideal Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, who can be delivered from the clutches of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span>?&rdquo; This idea is also expressed in many other places. <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="index2715.html?g=42747">5.5.2</a>) says, <span class="Italic">mahat-sev&#257;&#7745; dv&#257;ram &#257;hur vimukte&#7717;:</span> if one desires liberation from the clutches of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> one must associate with a pure devotee <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;.</span> A <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;</span> is one who engages twenty-four hours daily in the loving service of the Lord. As K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index57c5.html?g=3102">9.13</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">mah&#257;tm&#257;nas tu m&#257;&#7745; p&#257;rtha<br>daiv&#299;&#7745; prak&#7771;tim &#257;&#347;rit&#257;&#7717;<br>bhajanty ananya-manaso<br>j&ntilde;&#257;tv&#257; bh&#363;t&#257;dim avyayam</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;O son of P&#7771;th&#257;, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the protection of the divine nature. They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, original and inexhaustible.&rdquo; Thus the symptom of a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;</span> is that he has no engagement other than service to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. One must render service to a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava in order to get freed from sinful reactions, revive one&rsquo;s original K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness and be trained in how to love K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. This is the result of <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tma-sev&#257;.</span> Of course, if one engages in the service of a pure devotee, the reactions of one&rsquo;s sinful life are vanquished automatically. Devotional service is necessary not to drive away an insignificant stock of sins, but to awaken our dormant love for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. As fog is vanquished at the first glimpse of sunlight, one&rsquo;s sinful reactions are automatically vanquished as soon as one begins serving a pure devotee; no separate endeavor is required.</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-rpita-pr&#257;&#7751;a&#7717;</span> refers to a devotee who dedicates his life to serving K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, not to being saved from the path to hellish life. A devotee is <span class="Italic">n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a-par&#257;ya&#7751;a,</span> or <span class="Italic">v&#257;sudeva-par&#257;ya&#7751;a,</span> which means that the path of V&#257;sudeva, or the devotional path, is his life and soul. <span class="Italic">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a-par&#257;&#7717; sarve na kuta&#347;cana bibhyati</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="indexb5dd.html?g=52522">6.17.28</a>): such a devotee is not afraid of going anywhere. There is a path toward liberation in the higher planetary systems and a path toward the hellish planets, but a <span class="Italic">n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a-para</span> devotee is unafraid wherever he is sent; he simply wants to remember K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, wherever he may be. Such a devotee is unconcerned with hell and heaven; he is simply attached to rendering service to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. When a devotee is put into hellish conditions, he accepts them as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s mercy: <span class="Italic">tat te &rsquo;nukamp&#257;&#7745; susam&#299;k&#7779;am&#257;&#7751;a&#7717;</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> 10.14.8). He does not protest, &ldquo;Oh, I am such a great devotee of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Why have I been put into this misery?&rdquo; Instead he thinks, &ldquo;This is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s mercy.&rdquo; Such an attitude is possible for a devotee who engages in the service of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s representative. This is the secret of success.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction.

If by studying <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> one decides to surrender to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, he is immediately freed from all sinful reactions.

Even though N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a and V&#257;sudeva are not different from K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, simply by surrendering to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a one fully surrenders to all His expansions, such as N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, V&#257;sudeva and Govinda.

Because neophyte devotees cannot understand what the forms of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, V&#257;sudeva and Govinda are, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a directly says, <span class="Italic">m&#257;m ekam.</span> Herein, this is also supported by the word <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-pad&#257;ravindayo&#7717;.</span> N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a does not speak personally, but K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, or V&#257;sudeva, does, as in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> for example. Therefore, to follow the direction of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> means to surrender unto K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and to surrender in this way is the highest perfection of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja had inquired from &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; how one can be saved from falling into the various conditions of hellish life. In this verse &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; answers that a soul who has surrendered to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a certainly cannot go to <span class="Italic">naraka,</span> hellish existence. To say nothing of going there, even in his dreams he does not see Yamar&#257;ja or his order carriers, who are able to take one there. In other words, if one wants to save himself from falling into <span class="Italic">naraka,</span> hellish life, he should fully surrender to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The word <span class="Italic">sak&#7771;t</span> is significant because it indicates that if one sincerely surrenders to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a once, he is saved even if by chance he falls down by committing sinful activities. Therefore K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexedd3.html?g=3255">9.30</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">api cet su-dur&#257;c&#257;ro<br>bhajate m&#257;m ananya-bh&#257;k<br>s&#257;dhur eva sa mantavya&#7717;<br>samyag vyavasito hi sa&#7717;</div>
</div><A NAME="75329"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Even if one commits the most abominable actions, if he is engaged in devotional service he is to be considered saintly because he is properly situated.&rdquo; If one never for a moment forgets K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, he is safe even if by chance he falls down by committing sinful acts.</div>
<div class="Purport">In the Second Chapter of <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index5584.html?g=745">2.40</a>) the Lord also says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">neh&#257;bhikrama-n&#257;&#347;o &rsquo;sti<br>pratyav&#257;yo na vidyate<br>svalpam apy asya dharmasya<br>tr&#257;yate mahato bhay&#257;t</div>
</div><A NAME="75332"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;In this endeavor there is no loss or diminution, and a little advancement on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">Elsewhere in the <span class="Ref_Italic">G&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexf336-3.html?g=2394">6.40</a>) the Lord says, <span class="Italic">na hi kaly&#257;&#7751;a-k&#7771;t ka&#347;cid durgati&#7745; t&#257;ta gacchati:</span> &ldquo;one who performs auspicious activity is never overcome by evil.&rdquo; The highest <span class="Italic">kaly&#257;&#7751;a</span> (auspicious) activity is to surrender to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. That is the only path by which to save oneself from falling down into hellish life. &#346;r&#299;la Prabodh&#257;nanda Sarasvat&#299; has confirmed this as follows:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">kaivalya&#7745; narak&#257;yate tri-da&#347;a-p&#363;r &#257;k&#257;&#347;a-pu&#7779;p&#257;yate<br>durd&#257;ntendriya-k&#257;la-sarpa-pa&#7789;al&#299; protkh&#257;ta-da&#7745;&#7779;&#7789;r&#257;yate<br>vi&#347;va&#7745; p&#363;r&#7751;a-sukh&#257;yate vidhi-mahendr&#257;di&#347; ca k&#299;&#7789;&#257;yate<br>yat-k&#257;ru&#7751;ya-ka&#7789;&#257;k&#7779;a-vaibhavavat&#257;&#7745; ta&#7745; gauram eva stuma&#7717;</div>
</div><A NAME="75335"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">The sinful actions of one who has surrendered unto K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a are compared to a snake with its poison fangs removed (<span class="Italic">protkh&#257;ta-da&#7745;&#7779;&#7789;r&#257;yate</span>). Such a snake is no longer to be feared. Of course, one should not commit sinful activities on the strength of having surrendered to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. However, even if one who has surrendered to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a happens to do something sinful because of his former habits, such sinful actions no longer have a destructive effect. Therefore one should adhere to the lotus feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a very tightly and serve Him under the direction of the spiritual master. Thus in all conditions one will be <span class="Italic">akuto-bhaya,</span> free from fear.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>

<div class="First">Here it is clearly mentioned that the child N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a was so young that he could not even speak or walk properly.

Although he was referring to the small child and not to the original N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, the name of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a is so powerful that even by chanting his son&rsquo;s name he was becoming purified (<span class="Italic">harer n&#257;ma harer n&#257;ma harer n&#257;maiva kevalam</span></I> [Adi </I><a href="indexd751.html?g=93741">17.21</a></I>]</I>). &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; has therefore declared that if one&rsquo;s mind is somehow or other attracted by the holy name of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (<span class="Italic">tasm&#257;t ken&#257;py up&#257;yena mana&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;e nive&#347;ayet</span>), one is on the path of liberation.

<div class="Purport">The heart of the body is a mechanical arrangement. As the Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index0d72.html?g=5952">18.61</a>):</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone&rsquo;s heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy.&rdquo; <span class="Italic">Yantra</span> means a machine, such as an automobile. The driver of the machine of the body is the individual soul, who is also its director or proprietor, but the supreme proprietor is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One&rsquo;s body is created through the agency of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">karma&#7751;&#257; daiva-netre&#7751;a</span>), and according to one&rsquo;s activities in this life, another vehicle is created, again under the supervision of <span class="Italic">daiv&#299; m&#257;y&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">daiv&#299; hy e&#7779;&#257; gu&#7751;a-may&#299; mama m&#257;y&#257; duratyay&#257;</span>). At the appropriate time, one&rsquo;s next body is immediately chosen, and both the individual soul and the Supersoul transfer to that particular bodily machine. This is the process of transmigration. During transmigration from one body to the next, the soul is taken away by the order carriers of Yamar&#257;ja and put into a particular type of hellish life (<span class="Italic">naraka</span>) in order to become accustomed to the condition in which he will live in his next body.</div>

<div class="Translation">Dear sirs, whose servants are you, where have you come from, and why are you forbidding us to touch the body of Aj&#257;mila? Are you demigods from the heavenly planets, are you sub-demigods, or are you the best of devotees?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The most significant word used in this verse is <span class="Italic">siddha-sattam&#257;&#7717;,</span> which means &ldquo;the best of the perfect.&rdquo; In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index7428.html?g=2487">7.3</a>) it is said, <span class="Italic">manu&#7779;y&#257;&#7751;&#257;&#7745; sahasre&#7779;u ka&#347;cid yatati siddhaye:</span> out of millions of persons, one may try to become <span class="Italic">siddha,</span> perfect&mdash;or, in other words, self-realized. A self-realized person knows that he is not the body but a spiritual soul (<span class="Italic">). At the present moment practically everyone is unaware of this fact, but one who understands this has attained perfection and is therefore called <span class="Italic">siddha.</span> When one understands that the soul is part and parcel of the supreme soul and one thus engages in the devotional service of the supreme soul, one becomes <span class="Italic">siddha-sat-tama.</span> One is then eligible to live in the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;aloka. The word <span class="Italic">siddha-sattama,</span> therefore, refers to a liberated, pure devotee.</div>
<div class="Purport">Since the Yamad&#363;tas are servants of Yamar&#257;ja, who is also one of the <span class="Italic">siddha-sattamas,</span> they knew that a <span class="Italic">siddha-sattama</span> is above the demigods and sub-demigods and, indeed, above all the living entities within this material world. The Yamad&#363;tas therefore inquired why the Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas were present where a sinful man was going to die.</div>
<div class="Purport">It should also be noted that Aj&#257;mila was not yet dead, for the Yamad&#363;tas were trying to snatch the soul from his heart. They could not take the soul, however, and therefore Aj&#257;mila was not yet dead. This will be revealed in later verses. Aj&#257;mila was simply in an unconscious state when the argument was in progress between the Yamad&#363;tas and the Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas. The conclusion of the argument was to be a decision regarding who would claim the soul of Aj&#257;mila.</div>

<div class="Translation">The order carriers of Yamar&#257;ja said: Your eyes are just like the petals of lotus flowers. Dressed in yellow silken garments, decorated with garlands of lotuses, and wearing very attractive helmets on your heads and earrings on your ears, you all appear fresh and youthful. Your four long arms are decorated with bows and quivers of arrows and with swords, clubs, conchshells, discs and lotus flowers.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Before even being introduced to a foreigner, one becomes acquainted with him through his dress, bodily features and behavior and can thus understand his position. Therefore when the Yamad&#363;tas saw the Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas for the first time, they were surprised. They said, &ldquo;By your bodily features you appear to be very exalted gentlemen, and you have such celestial power that you have dissipated the darkness of this material world with your own effulgences. Why then should you endeavor to stop us from executing our duty?&rdquo; It will be explained that the Yamad&#363;tas, the order carriers of Yamar&#257;ja, mistakenly considered Aj&#257;mila sinful. They did not know that although he was sinful throughout his entire life, he was purified by constantly chanting the holy name of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. In other words, unless one is a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, one cannot understand the activities of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava.</div>
<div class="Purport">The dress and bodily features of the residents of Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka are properly described in these verses. The residents of Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha, who are decorated with garlands and yellow silken garments, have four arms holding various weapons. Thus they conspicuously resemble Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. They have the same bodily features as N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a because they have attained the liberation of <span class="Italic">s&#257;r&#363;pya,</span> but they nevertheless act as servants. All the residents of Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka know perfectly well that their master is N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and that they are all His servants. They are all self-realized souls who are <span class="Italic">nitya-mukta,</span> everlastingly liberated. Although they could conceivably declare themselves N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a or Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, they never do so; they always remain K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious and serve the Lord faithfully. Such is the atmosphere of Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka. Similarly, one who learns the faithful service of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a through the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement will always remain in Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka and have nothing to do with the material world.</div>

<div class="Translation">The blessed messengers of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas, said: If you are actually servants of Yamar&#257;ja, you must explain to us the meaning of religious principles and the symptoms of irreligion.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This inquiry by the Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas to the Yamad&#363;tas is most important. A servant must know the instructions of his master. The servants of Yamar&#257;ja claimed to be carrying out his orders, and therefore the Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas very intelligently asked them to explain the symptoms of religious and irreligious principles. A Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava knows these principles perfectly well because he is well acquainted with the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Lord says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharm&#257;n parityajya m&#257;m eka&#7745; &#347;ara&#7751;a&#7745; vraja:</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="index3a32.html?g=5997">18.66</a>] &ldquo;Give up all other varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me.&rdquo; Therefore surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the actual principle of religion. Those who have surrendered to the principles of material nature instead of to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a are all impious, regardless of their material position. Unaware of the principles of religion, they do not surrender to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and therefore they are considered sinful rascals, the lowest of men, and fools bereft of all knowledge. As K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index8b11.html?g=2595">7.15</a>):</div>

<div class="Purport">The question posed by the Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas was very suitable. One who represents someone else must fully know that person&rsquo;s mission.

Those engaged in advanced pious activities are beyond punishment. Only those who engage in sinful activities are punishable. Therefore the Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas particularly inquired about who is punishable and why Yamar&#257;ja has been designated to discriminate between who is punishable and who is not. How is one to be judged? What is the basic principle of authority? These are the questions raised by the Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas.</div>

<div class="Translation">O best of the demigods, we can see three different varieties of life, which are due to the contamination of the three modes of nature. The living entities are thus known as peaceful, restless and foolish; as happy, unhappy or in-between; or as religious, irreligious and semireligious. We can deduce that in the next life these three kinds of material nature will similarly act.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The actions and reactions of the three modes of material nature are visible in this life. For example, some people are very happy, some are very distressed, and some are in mixed happiness and distress. This is the result of past association with the modes of material nature&mdash;goodness, passion and ignorance. Since these varieties are visible in this life, we may assume that the living entities, according to their association with the different modes of material nature, will be happy, distressed or between the two in their next lives also. Therefore the best policy is to disassociate oneself from the three modes of material nature and be always transcendental to their contamination. This is possible only when one fully engages in the devotional service of the Lord. As K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a confirms in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexee26.html?g=4817">14.26</a>):</div>

Even though he has a human body, a person in the mode of ignorance and interested only in his present body is like an animal, for an animal, being covered by ignorance, thinks that the ultimate goal of life and happiness is to eat as much as possible. A human being must be educated to understand his past life and how he can endeavor for a better life in the future. There is even a book, called <span class="Italic">Bh&#7771;gu-sa&#7745;hit&#257;,</span> which reveals information about one&rsquo;s past, present and future lives according to astrological calculations.

One who is interested only in his present body and who tries to enjoy his senses to the fullest extent is understood to be engrossed in the mode of ignorance. His future is very, very dark. Indeed, the future is always dark for one who is grossly covered by ignorance. Especially in this age, human society is covered by the mode of ignorance, and therefore everyone thinks his present body to be everything, without consideration of the past or future.</div>

<div class="Translation">Above the five senses of perception, the five working senses and the five objects of the senses is the mind, which is the sixteenth element. Above the mind is the seventeenth element, the soul, the living being himself, who, in cooperation with the other sixteen, enjoys the material world alone. The living being enjoys three kinds of situations, namely happy, distressful and mixed.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Everyone engages in work with his hands, legs and other senses just to achieve a certain goal according to his concocted ideas. One tries to enjoy the five sense objects, namely form, sound, taste, aroma and touch, not knowing the actual goal of life, which is to satisfy the Supreme Lord. Because of disobeying the Supreme Lord, one is put into material conditions, and he then tries to improve his situation in a concocted way, not desiring to follow the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Nevertheless, the Supreme Lord is so kind that He comes Himself to instruct the bewildered living entity how to act obediently and then gradually return home, back to Godhead, where he can attain an eternal, peaceful life of bliss and knowledge. The living entity has a body, which is a very complicated combination of the material elements, and with this body he struggles alone, as indicated in this verse by the words <span class="Italic">ekas tu.</span> For example, if one is struggling in the ocean, he must swim through it alone. Although many other men and aquatics are swimming in the ocean, he must take care of himself because no one else will help him. Therefore this verse indicates that the seventeenth item, the soul, must work alone. Although he tries to create society, friendship and love, no one will be able to help him but K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Lord. Therefore his only concern should be how to satisfy K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. That is also what K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a wants (<span class="Italic">sarva-dharm&#257;n parityajya m&#257;m eka&#7745; &#347;ara&#7751;a&#7745; vraja</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="index3a32.html?g=5997">18.66</a>]). People bewildered by material conditions try to be united, but although they strive for unity among men and nations, all their attempts are futile. Everyone must struggle alone for existence with the many elements of nature. Therefore one&rsquo;s only hope, as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a advises, is to surrender to Him, for He can help one become free from the ocean of nescience. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu therefore prayed:</div>

<div class="Translation">The subtle body is endowed with sixteen parts&mdash;the five knowledge-acquiring senses, the five working senses, the five objects of sense gratification, and the mind. This subtle body is an effect of the three modes of material nature. It is composed of insurmountably strong desires, and therefore it causes the living entity to transmigrate from one body to another in human life, animal life and life as a demigod. When the living entity gets the body of a demigod, he is certainly very jubilant, when he gets a human body he is always in lamentation, and when he gets the body of an animal, he is always afraid. In all conditions, however, he is actually miserable. His miserable condition is called sa&#7745;s&#7771;ti, or transmigration in material life.</div>

<div class="Translation">Not a single living entity can remain unengaged even for a moment. One must act by his natural tendency according to the three modes of material nature because this natural tendency forcibly makes him work in a particular way.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The <span class="Italic">sv&#257;bh&#257;vika,</span> or one&rsquo;s natural tendency, is the most important factor in action. One&rsquo;s natural tendency is to serve because a living entity is an eternal servant of God. The living entity wants to serve, but because of his forgetfulness of his relationship with the Supreme Lord, he serves under the modes of material nature and manufactures various modes of service, such as socialism, humanitarianism and altruism. However, one should be enlightened in the tenets of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and accept the instruction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that one give up all natural tendencies for material service under different names and take to the service of the Lord. One&rsquo;s original natural tendency is to act in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness because one&rsquo;s real nature is spiritual. The duty of a human being is to understand that since he is essentially spirit, he must abide by the spiritual tendency and not be carried away by material tendencies. &#346;r&#299;la Bhaktivinoda &#7788;h&#257;kura has therefore sung:</div>
<div class="Centered-Verse-in-purp">(miche) m&#257;y&#257;ra va&#347;e,     y&#257;ccha bhese&rsquo;,<br>kh&#257;ccha h&#257;bu&#7693;ubu, bh&#257;i</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;My dear brothers, you are being carried away by the waves of material energy and are suffering in many miserable conditions. Sometimes you are drowning in the waves of material nature, and sometimes you are tossed like a swimmer struggling in the ocean.&rdquo; As confirmed by Bhaktivinoda &#7788;h&#257;kura, this tendency to be battered by the waves of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> can be changed to one&rsquo;s original, natural tendency, which is spiritual, when the living entity comes to understand that he is eternally <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-d&#257;sa,</span> a servant of God, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">If instead of serving <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> under different names, one turns his service attitude toward the Supreme Lord, he is then safe, and there is no more difficulty.

<div class="Translation">The fruitive activities a living being performs, whether pious or impious, are the unseen cause for the fulfillment of his desires. This unseen cause is the root for the living entity&rsquo;s different bodies. Because of his intense desire, the living entity takes birth in a particular family and receives a body which is either like that of his mother or like that of his father. The gross and subtle bodies are created according to his desire.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The gross body is a product of the subtle body. As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index473d.html?g=2787">8.6</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">ya&#7745; ya&#7745; v&#257;pi smaran bh&#257;va&#7745;<br>tyajaty ante kalevaram<br>ta&#7745; tam evaiti kaunteya<br>sad&#257; tad-bh&#257;va-bh&#257;vita&#7717;</div>
</div><A NAME="75858"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain without fail.&rdquo; The atmosphere of the subtle body at the time of death is created by the activities of the gross body. Thus the gross body acts during one&rsquo;s lifetime, and the subtle body acts at the time of death. The subtle body, which is called <span class="Italic">li&#7749;ga,</span> the body of desire, is the background for the development of a particular type of gross body, which is either like that of one&rsquo;s mother or like that of one&rsquo;s father. According to the <span class="Italic">&#7770;g Veda,</span> if at the time of sex the secretions of the mother are more profuse than those of the father, the child will receive a female body, and if the secretions of the father are more profuse than those of the mother, the child will receive a male body. These are the subtle laws of nature, which act according to the desire of the living entity. If a human being is taught to change his subtle body by developing a consciousness of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, at the time of death the subtle body will create a gross body in which he will be a devotee of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, or if he is still more perfect, he will not take another material body but will immediately get a spiritual body and thus return home, back to Godhead. This is the process of the transmigration of the soul. Therefore instead of trying to unite human society through pacts for sense gratification that can never be achieved, it is clearly desirable to teach people how to become K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious and return home, back to Godhead. This is true now and, indeed, at any time.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The word <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti</span> means material nature, and <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a</span> may also refer to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one wants to continue his association with <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti,</span> the female energy of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and be separated from K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a by the illusion that he is able to enjoy <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti,</span> he must continue in his conditional life. If he changes his consciousness, however, and associates with the supreme, original person (<span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a&#7745; &#347;&#257;&#347;vatam</span>), or with His associates, he can get out of the entanglement of material nature. As confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexe89d.html?g=1505">4.9</a>), <span class="Italic">janma karma ca me divyam eva&#7745; yo vetti tattvata&#7717;:</span> one must simply understand the Supreme Person, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, in terms of His form, name, activities and pastimes. This will keep one always in the association of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. <span class="Italic">Tyaktv&#257; deha&#7745; punar janma naiti m&#257;m eti so&rsquo;rjuna:</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexe89d.html?g=1505">4.9</a>] thus after giving up his gross material body, one accepts not another gross body but a spiritual body in which to return home, back to Godhead. Thus one ends the tribulation caused by his association with the material energy. In summary, the living entity is an eternal servant of God, but he comes to the material world and is bound by material conditions because of his desire to lord it over matter. Liberation means giving up this false consciousness and reviving one&rsquo;s original service to the Lord.

<div class="Translation">Once this br&#257;hma&#7751;a Aj&#257;mila, following the order of his father, went to the forest to collect fruit, flowers and two kinds of grass, called samit and ku&#347;a. On the way home, he came upon a &#347;&#363;dra, a very lusty, fourth-class man, who was shamelessly embracing and kissing a prostitute. The &#347;&#363;dra was smiling, singing and enjoying as if this were proper behavior. Both the &#347;&#363;dra and the prostitute were drunk. The prostitute&rsquo;s eyes were rolling in intoxication, and her dress had become loose. Such was the condition in which Aj&#257;mila saw them.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">While traveling along the public way, Aj&#257;mila came upon a fourth-class man and a prostitute, who are vividly described here. Drunkenness was sometimes manifest even in bygone ages, although not very frequently. In this age of Kali, however, such sin is to be seen everywhere, for people all over the world have become shameless. Long ago, when he saw the scene of the drunken <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> and the prostitute, Aj&#257;mila, who was a perfect <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;,</span> was affected. Nowadays such sin is visible in so many places, and we must consider the position of a <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> student who sees such behavior. For such a <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> to remain steady is very difficult unless he is extremely strong in following the regulative principles. Nevertheless, if one takes to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness very seriously, he can withstand the provocation created by sin. In our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement we prohibit illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling. In Kali-yuga, a drunk, half-naked woman embracing a drunk man is a very common sight, especially in the Western countries, and restraining oneself after seeing such things is very difficult. Nevertheless, if by the grace of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a one adheres to the regulative principles and chants the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a will certainly protect him. Indeed, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says that His devotee is never vanquished (<span class="Italic">kaunteya pratij&#257;n&#299;hi na me bhakta&#7717; pra&#7751;a&#347;yati</span>). Therefore all the disciples practicing K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness should obediently follow the regulative principles and remain fixed in chanting the holy name of the Lord. Then there need be no fear. Otherwise one&rsquo;s position is very dangerous, especially in this Kali-yuga.</div>

If one atones according to the directions of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras,</span> one does not actually become free from sinful reactions, but if one chants the holy name of the Lord, even a glimpse of such chanting can immediately free one from all sins. Chanting the glories of the Lord&rsquo;s holy name awakens all good fortune. Therefore there is no doubt that Aj&#257;mila, being completely free from all sinful reactions, should not be punished by Yamar&#257;ja.&rdquo;</div>
</div><A NAME="76030"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">As they were saying this, the Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas released Aj&#257;mila from the ropes of the Yamad&#363;tas and left for their own abode. The <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> Aj&#257;mila, however, offered his respectful obeisances to the Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas. He could understand how fortunate he was to have chanted the holy name of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a at the end of his life. Indeed, he could realize the full significance of this good fortune. Having thoroughly understood the discussion between the Yamad&#363;tas and the Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas, he became a pure devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He lamented very much for how very sinful he had been, and he condemned himself again and again.</div>
</div><A NAME="76031"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Finally, because of his association with the Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas, Aj&#257;mila, his original consciousness aroused, gave up everything and went to Hardwar, where he engaged in devotional service without deviation, always thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus the Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas went there, seated him on a golden throne and took him away to Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka.</div>
</div><A NAME="76032"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">In summary, although the sinful Aj&#257;mila meant to call his son, the holy name of Lord N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, even though chanted in the preliminary stage, <span class="Italic">n&#257;m&#257;bh&#257;sa,</span> was able to give him liberation. Therefore one who chants the holy name of the Lord with faith and devotion is certainly exalted. He is protected even in his material, conditional life.</div>

<div class="Translation">The Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas said: Alas, how painful it is that irreligion is being introduced into an assembly where religion should be maintained. Indeed, those in charge of maintaining the religious principles are needlessly punishing a sinless, unpunishable person.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas accused the Yamad&#363;tas of violating the religious principles by attempting to drag Aj&#257;mila to Yamar&#257;ja for punishment. Yamar&#257;ja is the officer appointed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to judge religious and irreligious principles and to punish people who are irreligious. However, if completely sinless people are punished, the entire assembly of Yamar&#257;ja is contaminated. This principle applies not only in the assembly of Yamar&#257;ja, but throughout human society also.</div>
<div class="Purport">In human society, properly maintaining religious principles is the duty of the king&rsquo;s court or the government. Unfortunately, in this <span class="Italic">yuga,</span> Kali-yuga, the religious principles are tampered with, and the government cannot properly judge who is to be punished and who is not. It is said that in the Kali-yuga if one cannot spend money in court, one cannot get justice. Indeed, in courts of justice it is often found that magistrates are bribed for favorable judgments. Sometimes religious men who preach the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement for the benefit of the entire populace are arrested and harassed by the police and courts. The Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas, who are Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas, lamented for these very regrettable facts. Because of their spiritual compassion for all the fallen souls, Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas go out to preach according to the standard method of all religious principles, but unfortunately, because of the influence of Kali-yuga, Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas who have dedicated their lives to preaching the glories of the Lord are sometimes harassed and punished by courts on false charges of disturbing the peace.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">A king or governmental official should be so well qualified that he acts as a father, maintainer and protector of the citizens because of affection and love. He should give the citizens good advice and instructions according to the standard scriptures and should be equal to everyone. Yamar&#257;ja does this, for he is the supreme master of justice, and so do those who follow in his footsteps. However, if such persons become polluted and exhibit partiality by punishing an innocent, blameless person, where will the citizens go to take shelter for their maintenance and security?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The king, or in modern times the government, should act as the guardian of the citizens by teaching them the proper goal of life. The human form of life is especially meant for realization of one&rsquo;s self and one&rsquo;s relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead because this cannot be realized in animal life. The duty of the government, therefore, is to take charge of training all the citizens in such a way that by a gradual process they will be elevated to the spiritual platform and will realize the self and his relationship with God. This principle was followed by kings like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, Lord R&#257;macandra, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ambar&#299;&#7779;a and Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. The leaders of the government must be very honest and religious because otherwise all the affairs of the state will suffer. Unfortunately, in the name of democracy, rogues and thieves are electing other rogues and thieves to the most important posts in the government. Recently this has been proven in America, where the president had to be condemned and dragged down from his post by the citizens. This is only one case, but there are many others. Because of the importance of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, people should be K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious and should not vote for anyone who is not K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious. Then there will be actual peace and prosperity in the state. When a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava sees mismanagement in the government, he feels great compassion in his heart and tries his best to purify the situation by spreading the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a movement.</div>

<div class="Translation">People in general are not very advanced in knowledge by which to discriminate between religion and irreligion. The innocent, unenlightened citizen is like an ignorant animal sleeping in peace with its head on the lap of its master, faithfully believing in the master&rsquo;s protection.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Sanskrit word <span class="Italic">vi&#347;vasta-gh&#257;ta</span> refers to one who breaks faith or causes a breach of trust. The mass of people should always feel security because of the government&rsquo;s protection. Therefore, how regrettable it is for the government itself to cause a breach of trust and put the citizens in difficulty for political reasons. We actually saw during the partition days in India that although Hindus and Muslims were living together peacefully, manipulation by politicians suddenly aroused feelings of hatred between them, and thus the Hindus and Muslims killed one another over politics. This is a sign of Kali-yuga. In this age, animals are kept nicely sheltered, completely confident that their masters will protect them, but unfortunately as soon as the animals are fat, they are immediately sent for slaughter. Such cruelty is condemned by Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas like the Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas. Indeed, the hellish conditions already described await the sinful men responsible for such suffering. One who betrays the confidence of a living entity who takes shelter of him in good faith, whether that living entity be a human being or an animal, is extremely sinful. Because such betrayals now go unpunished by the government, all of human society is terribly contaminated. The people of this age are therefore described as <span class="Italic">mand&#257;&#7717; sumanda-matayo manda-bh&#257;gy&#257; hy upadrut&#257;&#7717; </I>[SB </span></I><a href="indexba1f.html?g=6203">1.1.10</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> As a consequence of such sinfulness, men are condemned (<span class="Italic">mand&#257;&#7717;</span>), their intelligence is unclear (<span class="Italic">sumanda-mataya&#7717;</span>), they are unfortunate (<span class="Italic">manda-bh&#257;gy&#257;&#7717;</span>), and therefore they are always disturbed by many problems (<span class="Italic">upadrut&#257;&#7717;</span>).

<div class="Translation">Aj&#257;mila has already atoned for all his sinful actions. Indeed, he has atoned not only for sins performed in one life but for those performed in millions of lives, for in a helpless condition he chanted the holy name of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Yamad&#363;tas had considered only the external situation of Aj&#257;mila.

<div class="First">Previously, when engaged in sinful activities to maintain his family, Aj&#257;mila chanted the name of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a without offenses. To chant the holy name of the Lord just to counteract one&rsquo;s sinful activities, or to commit sinful activities on the strength of chanting the holy name, is offensive (<span class="Italic">n&#257;mno bal&#257;d yasya hi p&#257;pa-buddhi&#7717;</span>). But although Aj&#257;mila engaged in sinful activities, he never chanted the holy name of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a to counteract them; he simply chanted the name N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a to call his son. Therefore his chanting was effective. Because of chanting the holy name of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a in this way, he had already vanquished the accumulated sinful reactions of many, many lives. In the beginning he was pure, but although he later committed many sinful acts, he was offenseless because he did not chant the holy name of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a to counteract them. One who always chants the holy name of the Lord without offenses is always pure. As confirmed in this verse Aj&#257;mila was already sinless, and because he chanted the name of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a he remained sinless. It did not matter that he was calling his son; the name itself was effective.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">By following the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies or undergoing atonement, sinful men do not become as purified as by chanting once the holy name of Lord Hari. Although ritualistic atonement may free one from sinful reactions, it does not awaken devotional service, unlike the chanting of the Lord&rsquo;s names, which reminds one of the Lord&rsquo;s fame, qualities, attributes, pastimes and paraphernalia.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura comments that the chanting of the holy name of the Lord has special significance that distinguishes it from the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies of atonement for severe, more severe or most severe sinful actions. There are twenty types of religious scriptures called <span class="Italic">dharma-&#347;&#257;stras,</span> beginning with the <span class="Italic">Manu-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">par&#257;&#347;ara-sa&#7745;hit&#257;,</span> but herein it is stressed that although one may become free from the reactions of the most sinful activities by following the religious principles of these scriptures, this cannot promote a sinful man to the stage of loving service to the Lord. On the other hand, chanting the holy name of the Lord even once not only frees one immediately from the reactions of the greatest sins, but also raises one to the platform of rendering loving service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is described as <span class="Italic">uttama&#347;loka</span> because He is famous for His glorious activities. Thus one serves the Lord by remembering His form, His attributes and pastimes. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura explains that this is all possible simply by chanting the Lord&rsquo;s holy name because of the Lord&rsquo;s omnipotence. What cannot be achieved through the performance of Vedic rituals can be easily achieved through the chanting of the Lord&rsquo;s holy name. To chant the holy name and dance in ecstasy is so easy and sublime that one can achieve all the benefits of spiritual life simply by following this process. Therefore &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu declares, <span class="Italic">para&#7745; vijayate &#347;r&#299;-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-sa&#7749;k&#299;rtanam:</span> &ldquo;All glories to &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana!</span>&rdquo; The <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> movement we have started offers the best process for becoming purified of all sinful reactions and coming immediately to the platform of spiritual life.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">The ritualistic ceremonies of atonement recommended in the religious scriptures are insufficient to cleanse the heart absolutely because after atonement one&rsquo;s mind again runs toward material activities. Consequently, for one who wants liberation from the fruitive reactions of material activities, the chanting of the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a mantra, or glorification of the name, fame and pastimes of the Lord, is recommended as the most perfect process of atonement because such chanting eradicates the dirt from one&rsquo;s heart completely.</div>

Therefore simply by such glorification one not only becomes purified, but also achieves the results of pious activities (<span class="Italic">pu&#7751;ya-&#347;rava&#7751;a-k&#299;rtana</span>). <span class="Italic">Pu&#7751;ya-&#347;rava&#7751;a-k&#299;rtana</span> refers to the process of devotional service.

<div class="First">In this regard, &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura describes an incident that took place when S&#257;mba was rescued from the punishment of the Kauravas. S&#257;mba fell in love with the daughter of Duryodhana, and since according to <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> custom one is not offered a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya&rsquo;s</span> daughter unless he displays his chivalrous valor, S&#257;mba abducted her. Consequently S&#257;mba was arrested by the Kauravas. Later, when Lord Balar&#257;ma came to rescue him, there was an argument about S&#257;mba&rsquo;s release. Since the argument was not settled, Balar&#257;ma showed His power in such a way that all of Hastin&#257;pura trembled and would have been vanquished as if by a great earthquake. Then the matter was settled, and S&#257;mba married Duryodhana&rsquo;s daughter. The purport is that one should take shelter of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-Balar&#257;ma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose protective power is so great that it cannot be equaled in the material world. However powerful the reactions of one&rsquo;s sins, they will immediately be vanquished if one chants the name of Hari, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Balar&#257;ma or N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a.</div>

<div class="First">In the Western countries, where the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a movement is spreading, learned scholars and other thoughtful men are realizing its effectiveness. For example, Dr. J. Stillson Judah, a learned scholar, has been very much attracted to this movement because he has actually seen that it is turning hippies addicted to drugs into pure Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas who voluntarily become servants of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and humanity. Even a few years ago, such hippies did not know the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> but now they are chanting it and becoming pure Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas. Thus they are becoming free from all sinful activities, such as illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling.

One may or may not know the value of chanting the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> but if one somehow or other chants it, he will immediately be purified, just as one who takes a potent medicine will feel its effects, regardless of whether he takes it knowingly or unknowingly.</div>

<div class="Translation">After hearing the discourses between the Yamad&#363;tas and the Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas, Aj&#257;mila could understand the religious principles that act under the three modes of material nature. These principles are mentioned in the three Vedas. He could also understand the transcendental religious principles, which are above the modes of material nature and which concern the relationship between the living being and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Furthermore, Aj&#257;mila heard glorification of the name, fame, qualities and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He thus became a perfectly pure devotee. He could then remember his past sinful activities, which he greatly regretted having performed.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> mainly deal with the subject of the three modes of material nature. Rise above these modes, O Arjuna. Be transcendental to all of them. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the Self.&rdquo; The Vedic principles certainly prescribe a gradual process for rising to the spiritual platform, but if one remains attached to the Vedic principles, there is no chance of his being elevated to spiritual life. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a therefore advised Arjuna to perform devotional service, which is the process of transcendental religion. The transcendental position of devotional service is also confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="indexf76d.html?g=6379">1.2.6</a>). <span class="Italic">Sa vai pu&#7745;s&#257;&#7745; paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhok&#7779;aje.</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti,</span> devotional service, is <span class="Italic">paro dharma&#7717;,</span> transcendental <span class="Italic">dharma;</span> it is not material <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> People generally think that religion should be pursued for material profit.

The <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavata</span> religion teaches that the Lord and the living entity are eternally related and that the duty of the living entity is to surrender to the Lord. When one is situated on the platform of devotional service, one is freed from impediments and completely satisfied (<span class="Italic">ahaituky apratihat&#257; yay&#257;tm&#257; supras&#299;dati</span>). Having been elevated to that platform, Aj&#257;mila began to lament for his past materialistic activities and glorify the name, fame, form and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

Not only should one give up his past bad habits, but he must always regret his past sinful acts. This is the standard of pure devotion.</div>

<div class="First">For many years, material scientists have tried to go to the moon, but they are still unable to go there. However, the spiritual airplanes from the spiritual planets can take one back home, back to Godhead, in a second. The speed of such a spiritual plane can only be imagined. Spirit is finer than the mind, and everyone has experience of how swiftly the mind travels from one place to another. Therefore one can imagine the swiftness of the spiritual form by comparing it to the speed of the mind. In less than even a moment, a perfect devotee can return home, back to Godhead, immediately after giving up his material body.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Therefore one who desires freedom from material bondage should adopt the process of chanting and glorifying the name, fame, form and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, at whose feet all the holy places stand. One cannot derive the proper benefit from other methods, such as pious atonement, speculative knowledge and meditation in mystic yoga, because even after following such methods one takes to fruitive activities again, unable to control his mind, which is contaminated by the base qualities of nature, namely passion and ignorance.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">It has actually been seen that even after achieving so-called perfection, many <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s, j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> become attached to material activities again. Many so-called <span class="Italic">sv&#257;m&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> give up material activities as false (<span class="Italic">jagan mithy&#257;</span>), but after some time they nevertheless resume material activities by opening hospitals and schools or performing other activities for the benefit of the public. Sometimes they participate in politics, although still falsely declaring themselves <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s,</span> members of the renounced order. The perfect conclusion, however, is that if one actually desires to get out of the material world, he must take to devotional service, which begins with <span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;a&#7745; k&#299;rtana&#7745; vi&#7779;&#7751;o&#7717;: </I>[SB </span></I><a href="indexda76.html?g=55355">7.5.23</a>] chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord. The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement has actually proved this. In the Western countries, many young boys who were addicted to drugs and who had many other bad habits, which they could not give up, abandoned all those propensities and very seriously engaged in chanting the glories of the Lord as soon as they joined the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement. In other words, this process is the perfect method of atonement for actions performed in <span class="Italic">raja&#7717;</span> and <span class="Italic">tama&#7717;</span> (passion and ignorance). As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="index517e.html?g=6496">1.2.19</a>):</div>

<div class="First">At the time of death one is certainly bewildered because his bodily functions are in disorder.

Nevertheless, such a person receives all the benefits of chanting the holy name. While the body is fit therefore, why should we not chant the holy name of the Lord loudly and distinctly? If one does so, it is quite possible that even at the time of death he will be properly able to chant the holy name of the Lord with love and faith. In conclusion, one who chants the holy name of the Lord constantly is guaranteed to return home, back to Godhead, without a doubt.</div>

<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura&rsquo;s commentary to texts nine and ten of this chapter form a dialogue concerning how one can become free from all sinful reactions simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purport">Someone may say, &ldquo;It may be accepted that by chanting the holy name of the Lord one becomes freed from all the reactions of sinful life. However, if one commits sinful acts in full consciousness, not only once but many, many times, he is unable to free himself from the reactions of such sins even after atoning for them for twelve years or more. How is it possible, then, that simply by once chanting the holy name of the Lord one immediately becomes freed from the reactions of such sins?&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura replies by quoting verses nine and ten of this chapter: &ldquo;The chanting of the holy name of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is the best process of atonement for a thief of gold or other valuables, for a drunkard, for one who betrays a friend or relative, for one who kills a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> or for one who indulges in sex with the wife of his <span class="Italic">guru</span> or another superior. It is also the best method of atonement for one who murders women, the king or his father, for one who slaughters cows, and for all other sinful men. Simply by chanting the holy name of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, such sinful persons may attract the attention of the Supreme Lord, who therefore considers &ldquo;Because this man has chanted My holy name, My duty is to give him protection.&rsquo; &rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">One may atone for sinful life and vanquish all sinful reactions by chanting the holy name, although this is not called atonement. Ordinary atonement may temporarily protect a sinful person, but it does not completely cleanse his heart of the deep-rooted desire to commit sinful acts. Therefore atonement is not as powerful as the chanting of the holy name of the Lord. In the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> it is said that if a person only once chants the holy name and completely surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Lord, the Lord immediately considers him His ward and is always inclined to give him protection. This is confirmed by &#346;r&#299;dhara Sv&#257;m&#299;. Thus when Aj&#257;mila was in great danger of being carried off by the order carriers of Yamar&#257;ja, the Lord immediately sent His personal order carriers to protect him, and because Aj&#257;mila was freed from all sinful reactions, the Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas spoke on his behalf.</div>
<div class="Purport">Aj&#257;mila had named his son N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, and because he loved the boy very much, he would call him again and again. Although he was calling for his son, the name itself was powerful because the name N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a is not different from the Supreme Lord N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. When Aj&#257;mila named his son N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, all the reactions of his sinful life were neutralized, and as he continued calling his son and thus chanting the holy name of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a thousands of times, he was actually unconsciously advancing in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purport">One may argue, &ldquo;Since he was constantly chanting the name of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, how was it possible for him to be associating with a prostitute and thinking of wine?&rdquo; By his sinful actions he was bringing suffering upon himself again and again, and therefore one may say that his ultimate chanting of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a was the cause of his being freed. However, his chanting would then have been a <span class="Italic">n&#257;ma-apar&#257;dha.</span> <span class="Italic">N&#257;mno bal&#257;d yasya hi p&#257;pa-buddhi&#7717;:</span> one who continues to act sinfully and tries to neutralize his sins by chanting the holy name of the Lord is a <span class="Italic">n&#257;ma-apar&#257;dh&#299;,</span> an offender to the holy name. In response it may be said that Aj&#257;mila&rsquo;s chanting was inoffensive because he did not chant the name of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a with the purpose of counteracting his sins. He did not know that he was addicted to sinful actions, nor did he know that his chanting of the name of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a was neutralizing them. Thus he did not commit a <span class="Italic">n&#257;ma-apar&#257;dha,</span> and his repeated chanting of the holy name of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a while calling his son may be called pure chanting. Because of this pure chanting, Aj&#257;mila unconsciously accumulated the results of <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Indeed, even his first utterance of the holy name was sufficient to nullify all the sinful reactions of his life. To cite a logical example, a fig tree does not immediately yield fruits, but in time the fruits are available. Similarly, Aj&#257;mila&rsquo;s devotional service grew little by little, and therefore although he committed very sinful acts, the reactions did not affect him. In the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> it is said that if one chants the holy name of the Lord even once, the reactions of past, present or future sinful life do not affect him. To give another example, if one extracts the poison fangs of a serpent, this saves the serpent&rsquo;s future victims from poisonous effects, even if the serpent bites repeatedly. Similarly, if a devotee chants the holy name even once inoffensively, this protects him eternally. He need only wait for the results of the chanting to mature in due course of time.</div>
<div class="Thus-end"><span class="Italic">Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Sixth Canto, Second Chapter, of the</span> &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, <span class="Italic">entitled &ldquo;Aj&#257;mila Delivered by the Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas.&rdquo;</span></div>

<div class="Normal-Level">As related in this chapter, the Yamad&#363;tas approached Yamar&#257;ja, who very exhaustively explained <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavata-dharma,</span> the religious principle of devotional service. Yamar&#257;ja thus satisfied the Yamad&#363;tas, who had been very disappointed. Yamar&#257;ja said, &ldquo;Although Aj&#257;mila was calling for his son, he chanted the holy name of the Lord, N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, and simply by a glimpse of the chanting of the holy name, he immediately achieved the association of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&rsquo;s order carriers, who saved him from your attempt to arrest him. This is quite all right. It is a fact that even a chronically sinful person who chants the holy name of the Lord, although not completely without offenses, does not take another material birth.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">By chanting the holy name of the Lord, Aj&#257;mila had met four order carriers of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. They were very beautiful and had quickly come to rescue him. Yamar&#257;ja now described them. &ldquo;The Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas are all pure devotees of the Lord, the Supreme Person in regard to the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this cosmic manifestation. Neither King Indra, Varu&#7751;a, &#346;iva, Brahm&#257;, the seven <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is</span> nor I myself can understand the transcendental activities of the Supreme Lord, who is self-sufficient and beyond the reach of the material senses. With material senses, no one can attain enlightenment about Him. The Lord, the master of the illusory energy, possesses transcendental qualities for the good fortune of everyone, and His devotees are also qualified in that way. The devotees, concerned only with rescuing the fallen souls from this material world, apparently take birth in different places in the material world just to save the conditioned souls. If one is somewhat interested in spiritual life, the devotees of the Lord protect him in many ways.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Yamar&#257;ja continued, &ldquo;The essence of <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana-dharma,</span> or eternal religion, is extremely confidential. No one but the Lord Himself can deliver that confidential religious system to human society. It is by the mercy of the Lord that the transcendental system of religion can be understood by His pure devotees, and specifically by the twelve <span class="Italic">mah&#257;janas</span>&mdash;Lord Brahm&#257;, N&#257;rada Muni, Lord &#346;iva, the Kum&#257;ras, Kapila, Manu, Prahl&#257;da, Janaka, Bh&#299;&#7779;ma, Bali, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; and me. Other learned scholars, headed by Jaimini, are almost always covered by the illusory energy, and therefore they are more or less attracted by the flowery language of the three <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> namely <span class="Italic">&#7770;g, Yajur</span> and <span class="Italic">S&#257;ma,</span> which are called <span class="Italic">tray&#299;.</span> Instead of becoming pure devotees, people captivated by the flowery words of these three <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are interested in the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies. They cannot understand the glories of chanting the holy name of the Lord. Intelligent persons, however, take to the devotional service of the Lord. When they chant the holy name of the Lord without offenses, they are no longer subject to my rulings. If by chance they commit some sinful act, they are protected by the holy name of the Lord because that is where their interest lies. The four weapons of the Lord, especially the club and the Sudar&#347;ana <span class="Italic">cakra,</span> always protect the devotees. One who chants, hears or remembers the holy name of the Lord without duplicity, or who prays or offers obeisances to the Lord, becomes perfect, whereas even a learned person may be called to hell if he is bereft of devotional service.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">After Yamar&#257;ja thus described the glories of the Lord and His devotees, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; further explained the potency of chanting the holy name and the futility of performing Vedic ritualistic ceremonies and pious activities for atonement.</div>

<div class="Translation">If in this universe there are many rulers and justices who disagree about punishment and reward, their contradictory actions will neutralize each other, and no one will be punished or rewarded. Otherwise, if their contradictory acts fail to neutralize each other, everyone will have to be both punished and rewarded.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Because the Yamad&#363;tas had been unsuccessful in carrying out the order of Yamar&#257;ja, they doubted whether Yamar&#257;ja actually had the power to punish the sinful. Although they had gone to arrest Aj&#257;mila, following Yamar&#257;ja&rsquo;s order, they found themselves unsuccessful because of the order of some higher authority. Therefore they were unsure of whether there were many authorities or only one. If there were many authorities who gave different judgments, which could be contradictory, a person might be wrongly punished or wrongly rewarded, or he might be neither punished nor rewarded. According to our experience in the material world, a person punished in one court may appeal to another. Thus the same man may be either punished or rewarded according to different judgments. However, in the law of nature or the court of the Supreme Personality of Godhead there cannot be such contradictory judgments. The judges and their judgments must be perfect and free from contradictions. Actually the position of Yamar&#257;ja was very awkward in the case of Aj&#257;mila because the Yamad&#363;tas were right in attempting to arrest Aj&#257;mila, but the Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas had baffled them. Although Yamar&#257;ja, under these circumstances, was accused by both the Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas and the Yamad&#363;tas, he is perfect in administering justice because he is empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore he will explain what his real position is and how everyone is controlled by the supreme controller, the Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation">Yamar&#257;ja said: My dear servants, you have accepted me as the Supreme, but factually I am not. Above me, and above all the other demigods, including Indra and Candra, is the one supreme master and controller.

He is like the two threads that form the length and breadth of a woven cloth. The entire world is controlled by Him just as a bull is controlled by a rope in its nose.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The order carriers of Yamar&#257;ja suspected that there was a ruler even above Yamar&#257;ja. To eradicate their doubts, Yamar&#257;ja immediately replied, &ldquo;Yes, there is one supreme controller above everything.&rdquo; Yamar&#257;ja is in charge of some of the moving living entities, namely the human beings, but the animals, who also move, are not under his control. Only human beings have consciousness of right and wrong, and among them only those who perform sinful activities come under the control of Yamar&#257;ja. Therefore although Yamar&#257;ja is a controller, he is only a departmental controller of a few living entities. There are other demigods who control many other departments, but above them all is one supreme controller, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. <span class="Italic">&#298;&#347;vara&#7717; parama&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&#7717; sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha&#7717; </I>[</I>Bs. </span>5.1</I>]<span class="Italic"></I>:</span> the supreme controller is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.

<div class="Translation">Just as the driver of a bullock cart ties ropes through the nostrils of his bulls to control them, the Supreme Personality of Godhead binds all men through the ropes of His words in the Vedas, which set forth the names and activities of the distinct orders of human society [br&#257;hma&#7751;a, k&#7779;atriya, vai&#347;ya and &#347;&#363;dra]. In fear, the members of these orders all worship the Supreme Lord by offering Him presentations according to their respective activities.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In this material world, everyone is conditioned, regardless of who he is. One may be a human being, a demigod or an animal, tree or plant, but everything is controlled by the laws of nature, and behind this natural control is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is confirmed by <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index652d.html?g=3075">9.10</a>), wherein K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says, <span class="Italic">may&#257;dhyak&#7779;e&#7751;a prak&#7771;ti&#7717; s&#363;yate sa-car&#257;caram:</span> &ldquo;The material nature is working under My direction and producing all moving and nonmoving beings.&rdquo; Thus K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is behind the natural machine, which works under His control.</div>
<div class="Purport">Apart from other living entities, the living being in the human form of body is systematically controlled by the Vedic injunctions in terms of the divisions of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama.</span> A human being is expected to follow the rules and regulations of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama;</span> otherwise he cannot escape punishment by Yamar&#257;ja. The point is that every human being is expected to elevate himself to the position of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> the most intelligent man, and then one must transcend that position to become a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. This is the perfection of life. The <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a, k&#7779;atriya, vai&#347;ya</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> can elevate themselves by worshiping the Lord according to their activities (<span class="Italic">sve sve karma&#7751;y abhirata&#7717; sa&#7745;siddhi&#7745; labhate nara&#7717;</span>).

The Supreme Lord exists vertically and horizontally (<span class="Italic">ota&#7745; protam</span>), and therefore if one follows the Vedic injunctions by worshiping the Supreme Lord according to one&rsquo;s ability, his life will be perfect.

As the Lord Himself confirms in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a>), <span class="Italic">sarvasya c&#257;ha&#7745; h&#7771;di sannivi&#7779;&#7789;o matta&#7717; sm&#7771;tir j&ntilde;&#257;nam apohana&#7745; ca:</span> &ldquo;I am sitting in everyone&rsquo;s heart and giving directions for remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.&rdquo; Elsewhere in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is stated, <span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;vara&#7717; sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;n&#257;&#7745; h&#7771;d-de&#347;e &rsquo;rjuna ti&#7779;&#7789;hati:</I> [Bg. </I><a href="index0d72.html?g=5952">18.61</a></I>]</I></span> &ldquo;The Supreme Lord, as the Supersoul, is situated within the heart.&rdquo; The living entity cannot do anything without the sanction of the Supersoul. The Supersoul is acting at every moment, but the living entity cannot understand the form and activities of the Supersoul by manipulating his senses. The example of the eyes and the bodily limbs is very appropriate. If the limbs could see, they could walk forward without the help of the eyes, but that is impossible. Although one cannot see the Supersoul in one&rsquo;s heart through sensual activities, His direction is necessary.</div>

One must take shelter of one of these four <span class="Italic">samprad&#257;yas</span> in order to understand the most confidential religious system.

As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> <span class="Italic">bhakty&#257; m&#257;m abhij&#257;n&#257;ti:</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexbf7d.html?g=5898">18.55</a>] simply by devotional service one can understand everything about the Supreme Lord. If one fortunately understands the Supreme Lord in this way, the result is <span class="Italic">tyaktv&#257; deha&#7745; punar janma naiti:</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexe89d.html?g=1505">4.9</a>] after giving up his material body, he no longer has to take birth in this material world.

<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">M&#257;lat&#299;:</span></B> This lecture was recorded on February 15, 1971, in the morning, and it was in Gorakhpur, in U.P., India. It was on the occasion of &#346;r&#299;la Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299;'s Appearance Day. That day, we fasted in the morning up till noon time. Then we offered a regular noon meal, and in the evening time there was the feast of four preparations: <I>puris, halav&#257;,</I> vegetable, and chutney.</B></I></div>

<div class="After-Verse">So we have concluded this verse, that Yamar&#257;ja says that the holy name of the Personality of Godhead, Bh&#257;gavata, not only His name, but also His activities and His qualities, these qualities... Last night, somebody was discussing with me <I>sagu&#7751;a</I> and <I>nirgu&#7751;a. Sagu&#7751;a</I> means, according to their version, or a standard version, <I>sagu&#7751;a</I> means the material quality. They worship <I>sagu&#7751;a-r&#363;pa. Sagu&#7751;a</I> means forms of this material world. <I>S&#257;dhak&#257;n&#257;&#7745; hit&#257;rth&#257;ya br&#257;hma&#7751;a-r&#363;pa-kalpana&#7717;.(?) Kalpana&#7717;. </I>According to M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; school, the Absolute Truth is imperson. In the <I>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</I> it is also said, <I>kle&#347;o 'dhikataras te&#7779;&#257;m, adhikataras te&#7779;&#257;m avyakt&#257;sakta-cetas&#257;m</I> [Bg. <a href="index3958.html?g=4186">12.5</a>]<I>.</I> Say, for meditation, it is very difficult to meditate on impersonal feature. Therefore, they artificially think like that: "I am the whole. I am moving the stars, I am moving the moon." Or some color display is taking place. Artificially. This meditation is artificial. Therefore, they do not get any result. Simply waste time, and they remain the number one debauch, as they are. So this kind of meditation... Because they will not put any form... "The Brahman is impersonal." So how they can think of any form? It is very difficult to adjust. Therefore <I>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</I> says, <I>kle&#347;o 'dhikataras te&#7779;&#257;m</I> [Bg. <a href="index3958.html?g=4186">12.5</a>]<I>.</I> They want to meditate upon impersonal Brahman, but it is very troublesome. Because Brahman is not impersonal, but force, they want to make Brahman impersonal.</I></div>
<div class="Lecture">So in order to mitigate this troublesome position, some of their <I>&#257;c&#257;ryas,</I> &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya, has said that "You imagine a form. There is no real form, but you imagine some form." And he has recommended five forms. The first form is Durg&#257;, &#346;akti. The second form is S&#363;rya, the sun, sun worshiper. And the third form is Ga&#7751;e&#347;a, and the fourth form is &#346;iva. And the fifth form is Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Of course, these are the different stages of spiritual development. Durg&#257;... Durg&#257; means the material power, energy. So when a person is in the lowest stage of material existence, he realizes some power. That's a fact. The scientists also, they realize some power, there is some power in the material world. They go on searching after what is the ultimate power, but they cannot find it out. That is not possible. But they accept that there is some power, nature's power. So that is the stage of <I>&#347;akta</I> stage, Durg&#257; worship. Then... Power... Just like modern scientists, they also have gone to the power of the sun. That power, another power. That power is sun, and that is called <I>saura,</I> worshiping the sun. Just like there is a Parsi community in India. Fire worship is recommended in the <I>Vedas.</I> So that powerful sun, sun-god, they worship the sun. That is the stage of <I>saura, saura</I> stage. And then, next is the power <I>vox populi,</I> the power of the votes. That is the stage of Ga&#7751;apati. <I>Ga&#7751;a... Ga&#7751;a</I> means the number of people. Just like in nationalism they are counting upon the power. In this way, they realize some sort of power, I mean to say, moving force or the soul. That is the stage of... They say, <I>&#347;ivo 'ham. &#346;ivo 'ham. Aha&#7745; brahm&#257;smi.</I> That is the stage of <I>&#347;aiva.</I> And when they expand that, that "This power, this spiritual power, soul, is all over, all-pervading, impersonal Brahman," that is... They, sometimes they accept Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Vi&#7779;&#7751;u means all-pervading. But their realization of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is impersonal.</I></div>
<div class="Lecture">When Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu was discussing with R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya what is the process of elevation, <I>s&#257;dhya, s&#257;dhana,</I> what is the ultimate objective, R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya quoted a verse from the <I>Vi&#7779;&#7751;u Pur&#257;&#7751;a</I> that,</I></div>
<div class="Verse">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;ram&#257;c&#257;ravat&#257;<br>puru&#7779;e&#7751;a para&#7717; pum&#257;n<br>vi&#7779;&#7751;ur &#257;r&#257;dhyate panth&#257;<br>n&#257;nyat tat-to&#7779;a-k&#257;ra&#7751;am<br> </I>[<I>Cc. Madhya</I> <a href="index7e4d.html?g=105217">8.58</a></I>]</I></div>
<div class="After-Verse">The beginning of real human civilization is observance of the institute of four <I>var&#7751;as</I> and four <I>&#257;&#347;ramas.</I> That is the beginning of civilized life. Otherwise, it is not civilized life; it is crude, uncivilized life, where there is no <I>var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama,</I> where there (is) no division of society according to work and quality and <I>&#257;&#347;rama,</I> spiritual life division. So R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya recommended this verse, that this is the process to satisfy the Supreme Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. But Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu said that <I>eho b&#257;hya &#257;ge kaha &#257;ra,</I> "This is external. If you know something more, better than this, you say." Why He said? There is the version, <I>vi&#7779;&#7751;ur &#257;r&#257;dhyate.</I> Does it mean that He is rejecting Vi&#7779;&#7751;u worship? No, He's not rejecting. Because generally, they, these impersonalists, M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s, they also worship sometimes Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, these five demigods and God. But their idea is that ultimately impersonal. The impersonal takes the form by the help of this material world. The formation takes place simply in the material. That is their opinion. Therefore they say, call, <I>sagu&#7751;a. Sagu&#7751;a-up&#257;san&#257;.</I></div>
<div class="Lecture"></I>Just try to understand this. <I>Sagu&#7751;a-up&#257;san&#257;</I> means when Brahman takes a form He takes a form from this material help. Just like we take a form, we spiritual entities. We also take a form, transmigration of the soul according to <I>karma.</I> I create a certain type of mentality, and that continues throughout my life. And at the time of death, because I have got a certain type of mentality, man-mentality or God-mentality or dog-mentality or fly-mentality, any kind of... There are so many. So I have to take a certain type of body. So that body I have to take not by my whim. <I>Daivena. Daiva-netre&#7751;a:</I> by the decision of higher authorities. <I>Daiva,</I> generally, it means the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His agents. He has got many. <I>Par&#257;sya &#347;aktir vividhaiva &#347;r&#363;yate<span class="Italic"></I> </I>[Cc. Madhya <a href="index4653.html?g=113909">13.65</a>,</I> purport</I>]</span><I>.</I> So the material agent is Durg&#257;. So I create a mentality by my association with this material world. There are three kinds of qualities: <I>sattva-gu&#7751;a, rajo-gu&#7751;a, tamo-gu&#7751;a.</I> So one of them or mixed, I will have to accept. Because I am associating. Just like... It is not difficult. If you associate with the hippies, you will become hippie. If you associate with the hippies, you will become hippie. If you associate with the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, you become Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. That is practical. So similarly, if you associate with <I>tamo-gu&#7751;a...</I> One of the features of <I>tamo-gu&#7751;a</I> is laziness and sleepy. I am against so much sleeping because it is <I>tamo-gu&#7751;a.</I> And the features of <I>rajo-gu&#7751;a</I> is very active, but for sense gratification. Just like ordinary persons, they are very active. They rise also early in the morning, they work very hard, but the whole plan is for sense gratification. That's all. That is <I>rajo-gu&#7751;a.</I> And <I>sattva-gu&#7751;a</I> means they are silent, they are sober, they know what is what, and they try for spiritual advancement. That is <I>sattva-gu&#7751;a.</I></div>
<div class="Lecture"></I>So you can understand whether a man is in <I>sattva-gu&#7751;a </I>or a man is in <I>rajo-gu&#7751;a </I>or a man is in <I>tamo-gu&#7751;a </I>by the symptoms of his behavior. So as we associate with different types of <I>gu&#7751;as </I>we develop a certain type of mentality that continues, and if it continues up to the point of death, then certainly we'll have to accept a body influenced by these <I>gu&#7751;as. </I>Therefore <I>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; </I>says, <I>prak&#7771;te&#7717; kriyam&#257;&#7751;&#257;ni gu&#7751;ai&#7717; karm&#257;&#7751;i sarva&#347;a&#7717;<span class="Italic"></I> [Bg. </span></I><a href="index15ec.html?g=1275">3.27</a>]<I>. Yasm&#257;t, </I>these <I>gu&#7751;ai&#7717;. Prak&#7771;te&#7717; kriyam&#257;&#7751;&#257;ni gu&#7751;ai&#7717;. </I>According to the association of <I>gu&#7751;a, </I>or quality, <I>prak&#7771;ti </I>gives you a certain type of body. The body is given by <I>prak&#7771;ti, </I>by nature. Therefore, nature is called mother, Durg&#257;. Just like we develop this body exactly from the mother's womb. The father gives the seed, but the bodily ingredients, that is... Just like mother is developing the body, similarly, she is developing the child's body also, by eating, by the secretion, by development of the secretion, air. Air is solidifying the secretion. It is becoming gradually muscles, skin, bone, as it is becoming harder and harder. A very nice factory is going on. That is also by nature. And nature is working by the order of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Therefore, ultimate cause is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</I></div>
<div class="Lecture">So this bodily development given by the nature is also adduced to the body of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. That is M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophy. M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophy means they accept K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as God, but He has assumed a body which is given by this material nature, as it is given to us. That is their policy. They count K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a an ordinary man, on the same level. But that is not a fact. Therefore K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a condemns this philosophy, <I>avaj&#257;nanti m&#257;&#7745; m&#363;&#7693;h&#257; m&#257;nu&#7779;&#299;&#7745; tanum &#257;&#347;ritam<span class="Italic"></I> [Bg. </span></I><a href="indexa12b.html?g=3084">9.11</a>]<I>. </I>"Because I appear as a human being, therefore these rascals consider that I am ordinary man." The rascals, <I>m&#363;&#7693;h&#257;&#7717;. M&#363;&#7693;h&#257;&#7717;</I> means rascals, <I>g&#257;dh&#257;&#7717;,</I> asses. Their designation is given by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as asses, rascals. And Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu therefore said, <I>m&#257;y&#257;v&#257;di-bh&#257;&#7779;ya &#347;unile haya sarva-n&#257;&#347;a </I>[<I>Cc. <span class="Ref_Italic"></B></I>Madhya</span></B> <a href="index02b9.html?g=103116">6.169</a>]<I>.</I> Because these commentaries, comments by the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; school, is simply rascaldom. And if one hears such commentary by the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s, the result will be he'll be doomed. Doomed means forever... Forever, no. For very, very long time he'll not be able to understand actual his relationship with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Therefore he's doomed. And because he is not able to understand his relationship with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, he is called <I>r&#257;k&#7779;asa</I> or <I>asura. &#256;sura&#7745; bh&#257;vam &#257;&#347;rit&#257;&#7717;.</I></div>
<div class="Lecture"></I>That is also condemned in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in the <I>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;. Na m&#257;&#7745; du&#7779;k&#7771;tino m&#363;&#7693;h&#257;&#7717; prapadyante nar&#257;dham&#257;&#7717; m&#257;yay&#257;pah&#7771;ta-j&ntilde;&#257;n&#257;&#7717;<span class="Italic"></I> [Bg. </span></I><a href="index8b11.html?g=2595">7.15</a>]<I>.</I> You'll find amongst them very, very learned men, very, very good scholar. They can quote... Intelligent men. Because their M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; commentary, they can utilize, and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a gives them intelligence also, that "You misuse this verse in this way because you want..." <I>T&#257;n aha&#7745; dvi&#7779;ata&#7717; kr&#363;r&#257;n </I>[<I>Bg. </I><a href="indexeb92.html?g=5150">16.19</a></I>]<I>.</I> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is sitting within the heart of everyone. So M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosopher wants to kill God, or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Or <I>nirvi&#347;e&#7779;a-&#347;&#363;nyav&#257;di,</I> they want to make K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as zero or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as <I>nir&#257;k&#257;ra.</I> So K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a also gives them intelligence, "Yes, you just put forward this logic, that logic, that logic, and you prove." That is also confirmed in the <I>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, sarvasya c&#257;ha&#7745; h&#7771;di sannivi&#7779;&#7789;a&#7717;:</I> "I am sitting in everyone's heart." <I>Matta&#7717; sm&#7771;tir j&ntilde;&#257;nam apohana&#7745; ca</I> [Bg. </I><a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a></I>]<I>. Matta&#7717;, </I>"Through Me, from Me, all remembrance or memorization takes place."</I></div>
<div class="Lecture">So M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; wants to prove that the ultimate truth is <I>nir&#257;k&#257;ra,</I> or impersonal. So K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a gives you intelligence: "Yes, you put this forward. Put forward this logic, this logic, that logic." Similarly, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a gives... There is a Bengali proverb that how God works, that one man, a householder is praying to God, "My dear Lord, there may not be any theft case, burglary, in my home this night. Please save me." So one man is praying prayer, praying like that. Another man is praying, the thief, "My dear Lord, this night I shall commit burglary in that house. Please help me to get something." Now, what is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's position? (laughter) K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is everyone's heart. So K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a has to satisfy so many prayers. The burglar and the thief and the householder, so many prayers. So K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's adjustment... But He's still... That is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's intelligence, how He adjusts. He gives everyone freedom. And everyone is given facilities, but still He's in botheration. Therefore K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a advises to his devotees that "Don't plan anything. You rascal, you nonsense, you don't give Me trouble. (laughter) Please surrender unto Me. Just go under My plan; you'll be happy. You are making plan, you are unhappy; I am also unhappy. I am also unhappy. (laughter) So many plans are coming daily, and I'll have to fulfill." But He's merciful.

<div class="Lecture"></I>So except the devotee of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, everyone is simply giving K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble. Therefore, they are called <I>du&#7779;k&#7771;tina. Du&#7779;k&#7771;tina,</I> most miscreant, the miscreants. Don't make any plan. Accept K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's plan. That will be simply giving trouble to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Therefore, a devotee does not pray even for his maintenance. That is pure devotee. He doesn't give trouble to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a even for his bare maintenance. If he has no maintenance, he'll suffer, fasting; still, he'll not ask K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, "K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, I am very hungry. Give me some food." Of course, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is alert for His devotee, but a devotee's principle is not to place any plan to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Let K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a do. Simply we have to do according to the plan of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</I></div>
<div class="Lecture">So what is our plan? Our plan is, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's says, <I>sarva-dharm&#257;n parityajya m&#257;m eka&#7745; &#347;ara&#7751;a&#7745;</I> [Bg. </I><a href="index3a32.html?g=5997">18.66</a>]<I>. Man-man&#257; bhava mad-bhakto mad-y&#257;j&#299;.</I> So our plan is the same thing. We are simply canvassing for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, that "You become K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious." We have to show our example, how we are becoming K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious, how we are worshiping K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, how we are going on the street for vibrating K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's name, transcendental name. Now we are distributing K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's <I>pras&#257;dam.</I> As far as possible, our business is to induce persons how he becomes K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious. That's all. For that reason, you can make your plan, because that is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's plan. But that should also be sanctioned by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Don't make your own manufactured, concocted plan. Therefore, to guide you, a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's representative required. That is spiritual master.</I></div>
<div class="Lecture">So there is a huge plan and huge scheme. Therefore we have to follow the footsteps of the <I>mah&#257;janas.</I> As it is stated here, that <I>dv&#257;da&#347;aite vij&#257;n&#299;mo dharma&#7745; bh&#257;gavata&#7745; bha&#7789;&#257;&#7717;. </I>He said that "We, the selected <I>mah&#257;janas,</I> representatives of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, we know what is <I>bh&#257;gavata-dharma,</I> what is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <I>dharma.</I>" <I>Dv&#257;da&#347;a. Dv&#257;da&#347;a.</I> The <I>dv&#257;da&#347;a</I> means twelve names, already mentioned: <I>svayambh&#363;r n&#257;rada&#7717; &#347;ambhu&#7717;...</I> [SB <a href="index94f8.html?g=47678">6.3.20</a>].</I> I have explained. So Yamar&#257;ja said, "Only we, these twelve men, representatives of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, we know what is <I>bh&#257;gavata-dharma.</I>" <I>Dv&#257;da&#347;aite vij&#257;n&#299;ma&#7717;. Vij&#257;n&#299;ma&#7717; </I>means "we know." <I>Dharma&#7745; bh&#257;gavata&#7745; bha&#7789;&#257;&#7717;, guhya&#7745; vi&#347;uddha&#7745; durbodha&#7745; ya&#7745; j&ntilde;&#257;tv&#257;m&#7771;tam a&#347;nute.</I> "We know." Therefore it is advised, <I>mah&#257;jano yena gata&#7717; sa panth&#257;&#7717;</I> [Cc. Madhya <a href="index3936.html?g=121389">17.186</a>]<I>.</I> These <I>mah&#257;janas,</I> as they have prescribed, that is the real way for understanding K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, or spiritual salvation (service?).</I></div>
<div class="Lecture">So we are following the Brahma-samprad&#257;ya, the first, Svayambh&#363;. Brahm&#257;. Brahm&#257;, then N&#257;rada, from N&#257;rada, Vy&#257;sadeva. In this way, Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya, &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, in this way. So today, because we are following the footsteps of &#346;r&#299; Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; Gosv&#257;m&#299; Prabhup&#257;da, so this is, today is his appearance day. So we should honor this <I>tithi</I> very respectfully and pray to Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; Gosv&#257;m&#299; that "We are engaged in your service. So give us strength, give us intelligence. And we are being guided by your servant." So in this way we have to pray. And I think in the evening we shall distribute <I>pras&#257;dam.</I> Not at noon. In the evening there will be some, so many audience come. So they can be distributed <I>pras&#257;dam,</I> and some of the members who can come from Bhatikara, they can be also invited. So arrange for this. And at twelve o'clock, we offer <I>pu&#7779;p&#257;&ntilde;jali.</I> That <I>pu&#7779;p&#257;&ntilde;jali mantra,</I> it should be beginning... It should begin from the beginning. Not... You were singing, <I>&#347;r&#299;-v&#257;r&#7779;abh&#257;nav&#299;-dev&#299;.</I> There are two other lines. Why do you forget that?</I></div>

<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhup&#257;da:</span></B> No. Before that, there are two other lines. What is that?</B></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span></B> <I>Namo o&#7745; vi&#7779;&#7751;u-p&#257;d&#257;ya k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-pre&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;ya bh&#363;tale &#347;r&#299;mate bhaktisiddh&#257;nta-sarasvat&#299;ti n&#257;mine.</B></I></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhup&#257;da:</span></B> Why do you forget them? Yes. So you can chant this <I>mantra</I> and offer <I>pu&#7779;p&#257;&ntilde;jali</I> flower. And we shall together offer flowers. Actually, the worship is..., that is my duty. But <I>sago&#7779;&#7789;h&#299;.</I> Now I'll have to offer my respect with my spiritual family members, <I>sago&#7779;&#7789;h&#299;.</I> That is called <I>sago&#7779;&#7789;h&#299;.</I> Just like Vy&#257;sadeva says, <I>dh&#299;mahi.</I> He's offering prayer <I>sago&#7779;&#7789;h&#299;,</I> with all his followers and disciples. That is the process. So this flower offering will be done at twelve, and I think feasting will be in the evening. And after offering this <I>pu&#7779;p&#257;&ntilde;jali,</I> we can take our usual food. But the feasting may be done in the evening. Make like that. Because some audience, some members, visitors come, they should be given. And you can ask that Baka... Baka, his name is Baka?</B></I></div>

<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhup&#257;da:</span></B> Not a special plate. The process is that whatever we offer to the Deity, that is offered to guru. And guru offers to his guru.

The pictures of the <I>&#257;c&#257;ryas,</I> why there are? Actually, one has to offer the plate to his guru, and he'll offer his guru, he offers his guru, his guru.

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Because they are bewildered by the illusory energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Y&#257;j&ntilde;avalkya and Jaimini and other compilers of the religious scriptures cannot know the secret, confidential religious system of the twelve mah&#257;janas. They cannot understand the transcendental value of performing devotional service or chanting the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a mantra. Because their minds are attracted to the ritualistic ceremonies mentioned in the Vedas&mdash;especially the Yajur Veda, S&#257;ma Veda and &#7770;g Veda&mdash;their intelligence has become dull. Thus they are busy collecting the ingredients for ritualistic ceremonies that yield only temporary benefits, such as elevation to Svargaloka for material happiness. They are not attracted to the sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana movement; instead, they are interested in dharma, artha, k&#257;ma and mok&#7779;a.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Since one may easily achieve the highest success by chanting the holy name of the Lord, one may ask why there are so many Vedic ritualistic ceremonies and why people are attracted to them. This verse answers that question. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a>), <span class="Italic">vedai&#347; ca sarvair aham eva vedya&#7717;:</span> the real purpose of studying the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is to approach the lotus feet of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Unfortunately, unintelligent people bewildered by the grandeur of Vedic <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;as</span> want to see gorgeous sacrifices performed. They want Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras</span> chanted and huge amounts of money spent for such ceremonies. Sometimes we have to observe the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies to please such unintelligent men. Recently, when we established a large K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-Balar&#257;ma temple in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, we were obliged to have Vedic ceremonies enacted by <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> because the inhabitants of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, especially the <span class="Italic">sm&#257;rta-br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> would not accept Europeans and Americans as bona fide <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> Thus we had to engage <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> to perform costly <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;as.</span> In spite of these <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;as,</span> the members of our Society performed <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> loudly with <span class="Italic">m&#7771;da&#7749;gas,</span> and I considered the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> more important than the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies. Both the ceremonies and the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> were going on simultaneously. The ceremonies were meant for persons interested in Vedic rituals for elevation to heavenly planets (<span class="Italic">ja&#7693;&#299;-k&#7771;ta-matir madhu-pu&#7779;pit&#257;y&#257;m</span>), whereas the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> was meant for pure devotees interested in pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. We would simply have performed <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana,</span> but then the inhabitants of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana would not have taken the installation ceremony seriously. As explained here, the Vedic performances are meant for those whose intelligence has been dulled by the flowery language of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> which describe fruitive activities intended to elevate one to the higher planets.</div>
<div class="Purport">Especially in this age of Kali, <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> alone is sufficient. If the members of our temples in the different parts of the world simply continue <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> before the Deity, especially before &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, they will remain perfect. There is no need of any other performances. Nevertheless, to keep oneself clean in habits and mind, Deity worship and other regulative principles are required. &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; says that although <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> is sufficient for the perfection of life, the <span class="Italic">arcan&#257;,</span> or worship of the Deity in the temple, must continue in order that the devotees may stay clean and pure. &#346;r&#299;la Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura therefore recommended that one follow both processes simultaneously. We strictly follow his principle of performing Deity worship and <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> along parallel lines. This we should continue.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Considering all these points, therefore, intelligent men decide to solve all problems by adopting the devotional service of chanting the holy name of the Lord, who is situated in everyone&rsquo;s heart and who is a mine of all auspicious qualities. Such persons are not within my jurisdiction for punishment. Generally they never commit sinful activities, but even if by mistake or because of bewilderment or illusion they sometimes commit sinful acts, they are protected from sinful reactions because they always chant the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a mantra.<span class="Italic"></span></div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In this regard &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura quotes the following verse from the prayers of Lord Brahm&#257; (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> 10.14.29):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">ath&#257;pi te deva pad&#257;mbuja-dvaya-<br>pras&#257;da-le&#347;&#257;nug&#7771;h&#299;ta eva hi<br>j&#257;n&#257;ti tattva&#7745; bhagavan-mahimno<br>na c&#257;nya eko &rsquo;pi cira&#7745; vicinvan</div>
</div><A NAME="77084"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">The purport is that even though one is a very learned scholar of the Vedic <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras,</span> he may be completely unaware of the existence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His name, fame, qualities and so forth, whereas one who is not a great scholar can understand the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead if he somehow or other becomes a pure devotee of the Lord by engaging in devotional service. Therefore this verse spoken by Yamar&#257;ja says, <span class="Italic">eva&#7745; vim&#7771;&#347;ya sudhiyo bhagavati:</span> those who engage in the loving service of the Lord become <span class="Italic">sudhiya&#7717;,</span> intelligent, but this is not so of a Vedic scholar who does not understand K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s name, fame and qualities. A pure devotee is one whose intelligence is clear; he is truly thoughtful because he engages in the service of the Lord&mdash;not as a matter of show, but with love, with his mind, words and body. Nondevotees may make a show of religion, but it is not very effective because although they ostentatiously attend a temple or church, they are thinking of something else. Such persons are neglecting their religious duty and are punishable by Yamar&#257;ja. But a devotee who commits sinful acts, which he may do unwillingly or accidentally because of his former habits, is excused.

<div class="Translation">One who constantly hears and chants the holy name of the Lord and hears and chants about His activities can very easily attain the platform of pure devotional service, which can cleanse the dirt from one&rsquo;s heart.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">One may very easily practice chanting and hearing the holy name of the Lord and thus become ecstatic in spiritual life. <span class="Italic">Padma Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> states:</div>

There is no profit, however, in executing the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies. By performing such activities one may go to the higher planetary systems, but as stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index1885.html?g=3174">9.21</a>), <span class="Italic">k&#7779;&#299;&#7751;e pu&#7751;ye martya-loka&#7745; vi&#347;anti:</span> when the period of one&rsquo;s enjoyment in the heavenly planets is terminated because of the limited extent of the results of one&rsquo;s pious activities, one must return to earth. Thus there is no use in endeavoring to travel up and down in the universe. It is better to chant the holy name of the Lord so that one may become fully purified and eligible to return home, back to Godhead. That is the aim of life, and that is the perfection of life.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">After Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it appealed to &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; to describe in further detail the creation of the living entities within this universe, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; informed him that when the Pracet&#257;s, the ten sons of Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi, entered the sea to execute austerities, the planet earth was neglected because of the absence of a king. Naturally many weeds and unnecessary trees grew, and no food grains were produced. Indeed, all the land became like a forest. When the ten Pracet&#257;s came out of the sea and saw the entire world full of trees, they were very angry with the trees and decided to destroy them all to rectify the situation. Thus the Pracet&#257;s created wind and fire to burn the trees to ashes. Soma, however, the king of the moon and the king of all vegetation, forbade the Pracet&#257;s to destroy the trees, since the trees are the source of fruit and flowers for all living beings. Just to satisfy the Pracet&#257;s, Soma gave them a beautiful girl born of Pramloc&#257; Apsar&#257;. By the semen of all the Pracet&#257;s, Dak&#7779;a was born of that girl.</div>
</div><A NAME="77221"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">In the beginning, Dak&#7779;a created all the demigods, demons and human beings, but when he found the population not increasing properly, he took <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> and went to Vindhya Mountain, where be underwent severe austerities and offered Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u a particular prayer known as <span class="Italic">Ha&#7745;sa-guhya,</span> by which Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u became very pleased with him. The contents of the prayer were as follows.</div>
</div><A NAME="77222"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">&ldquo;The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supersoul, Lord Hari, is the controller of both the living entities and the material nature. He is self-sufficient and self-effulgent. As the subject matter of perception is not the cause of our perceiving senses, so the living entity, although within his body, does not cause his eternal friend the Supersoul, who is the cause of creation of all the senses. Because of the living entity&rsquo;s ignorance, his senses are engaged with material objects. Since the living entity is alive, he can understand the creation of this material world to some extent, but he cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is beyond the conception of the body, mind and intelligence. Nevertheless, great sages who are always in meditation can see the personal form of the Lord within their hearts.</div>
</div><A NAME="77223"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">&ldquo;Since an ordinary living being is materially contaminated, his words and intelligence are also material. Therefore he cannot ascertain the Supreme Personality of Godhead by manipulating his material senses. The conception of God derived through the material senses is inaccurate because the Supreme Lord is beyond the material senses, but when one engages his senses in devotional service, the eternal Supreme Personality of Godhead is revealed on the platform of the soul. When that Supreme Godhead becomes the aim of one&rsquo;s life, one is said to have attained spiritual knowledge.</div>
</div><A NAME="77224"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">&ldquo;The Supreme Brahman is the cause of all causes because He originally existed before the creation. He is the original cause of everything, both material and spiritual, and His existence is independent. However, the Lord has a potency called <span class="Italic">avidy&#257;,</span> the illusory energy, which induces the false arguer to think himself perfect and which induces the illusory energy to bewilder the conditioned soul. That Supreme Brahman, the Supersoul, is very affectionate to His devotees. To bestow mercy upon them, He discloses His form, name, attributes and qualities to be worshiped within this material world.</div>
</div><A NAME="77225"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">&ldquo;Unfortunately, however, those who are materially absorbed worship various demigods. As the air passes over a lotus flower and carries the scent of the flower with it, or as the air sometimes carries dust and therefore assumes colors, the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears as the various demigods according to the desires of His various foolish worshipers, but actually He is the supreme truth, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. To fulfill the desires of His devotees, He appears in various incarnations, and therefore there is no need to worship the demigods.&rdquo;</div>
</div><A NAME="77226"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Being very satisfied by the prayers of Dak&#7779;a, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u appeared before Dak&#7779;a with eight arms. The Lord was dressed in yellow garments and had a blackish complexion. Understanding that Dak&#7779;a was very eager to follow the path of enjoyment, the Lord awarded him the potency to enjoy the illusory energy. The Lord offered him the daughter of Pa&ntilde;cajana named Asikn&#299;, who was suitable for Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Dak&#7779;a to enjoy in sex. Indeed, Dak&#7779;a received his name because he was very expert in sex life. After awarding this benediction, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u disappeared.</div>

If one undergoes <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> but does not become a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, however, one does not develop good qualities. For example, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu and R&#257;va&#7751;a also performed great austerities, but they did so to demonstrate their demoniac tendencies. Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas must meet many opponents while preaching the glories of the Lord, but &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu recommends that they not become angry while preaching. Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu has given this formula: <span class="Italic">t&#7771;&#7751;&#257;d api sun&#299;cena taror api sahi&#7779;&#7751;un&#257;/ am&#257;nin&#257; m&#257;nadena k&#299;rtan&#299;ya&#7717; sad&#257; hari&#7717; </span></I> [Cc. adi </I><a href="index5365.html?g=93806">17.31</a></I>]<span class="Italic"></I>.</span> &ldquo;One should chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking oneself lower than the straw in the street; one should be more tolerant than a tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige and should be ready to offer all respect to others. In such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the Lord constantly.&rdquo; Those engaged in preaching the glories of the Lord should be humbler than grass and more tolerant than a tree; then they can preach the glories of the Lord without difficulty.</div>

<div class="Translation">As the sense objects [form, taste, touch, smell and sound] cannot understand how the senses perceive them, so the conditioned soul, although residing in his body along with the Supersoul, cannot understand how the supreme spiritual person, the master of the material creation, directs his senses. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto that Supreme Person, who is the supreme controller.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The individual soul and the Supreme Soul live together within the body. This is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads</span> by the analogy that two friendly birds live in one tree&mdash;one bird eating the fruit of the tree and the other simply witnessing and directing. Although the individual living being, who is compared to the bird that is eating, is sitting with his friend the Supreme Soul, the individual living being cannot see Him. Actually the Supersoul is directing the workings of his senses in the enjoyment of sense objects, but as these sense objects cannot see the senses, the conditioned soul cannot see the directing soul. The conditioned soul has desires, and the Supreme Soul fulfills them, but the conditioned soul is unable to see the Supreme Soul. Thus Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a offers his obeisances to the Supreme Soul, the Supersoul, even though unable to see Him. Another example given is that although ordinary citizens work under the direction of the government, they cannot understand how they are being governed or what the government is. In this regard, Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya quotes the following verse from the <span class="Italic">Skanda Pur&#257;&#7751;a:</span></div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">yath&#257; r&#257;j&ntilde;a&#7717; priyatva&#7745; tu<br>bh&#7771;ty&#257; vedena c&#257;tmana&#7717;<br>tath&#257; j&#299;vo na yat-sakhya&#7745;<br>vetti tasmai namo &rsquo;stu te</div>
</div><A NAME="77551"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;As the various servants in the different departments of big establishments cannot see the supreme managing director under whom they are working, the conditioned souls cannot see the supreme friend sitting within their bodies. Let us therefore offer our respectful obeisances unto the Supreme, who is invisible to our material eyes.&rdquo;</div>

<div class="Translation">When one&rsquo;s consciousness is completely purified of the contamination of material existence, gross and subtle, without being agitated as in the working and dreaming states, and when the mind is not dissolved as in su&#7779;upti, deep sleep, one comes to the platform of trance. Then one&rsquo;s material vision and the memories of the mind, which manifests names and forms, are vanquished. Only in such a trance is the Supreme Personality of Godhead revealed. Thus let us offer our respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is seen in that uncontaminated, transcendental state.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">There are two stages of God realization. One is called <span class="Italic">suj&ntilde;eyam,</span> or very easily understood (generally by mental speculation), and the other is called <span class="Italic">durj&ntilde;eyam,</span> understood only with difficulty. Param&#257;tm&#257; realization and Brahman realization are considered <span class="Italic">suj&ntilde;eyam,</span> but realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is <span class="Italic">durj&ntilde;eyam.</span> As described here, one attains the ultimate realization of the Personality of Godhead when one gives up the activities of the mind&mdash;thinking, feeling and willing&mdash;or, in other words, when mental speculation stops. This transcendental realization is above <span class="Italic">susupti,</span> deep sleep. In our gross conditional stage we perceive things through material experience and remembrance, and in the subtle stage we perceive the world in dreams. The process of vision also involves remembrance and also exists in a subtle form. Above gross experience and dreams is <span class="Italic">susupti,</span> deep sleep, and when one comes to the completely spiritual platform, transcending deep sleep, he attains trance, <span class="Italic">vi&#347;uddha-sattva,</span> or <span class="Italic">vasudeva-sattva,</span> in which the Personality of Godhead is revealed.</div>

The heart is covered by the three modes of material nature and the nine material elements [material nature, the total material energy, the ego, the mind and the five objects of sense gratification], and also by the five material elements and the ten senses. These twenty-seven elements constitute the external energy of the Lord. Great yog&#299;s meditate upon the Lord, who is situated as the Supersoul, Param&#257;tm&#257;, within the core of the heart. May that Supersoul be pleased with me. The Supersoul is realized when one is eager for liberation from the unlimited varieties of material life. One actually attains such liberation when he engages in the transcendental loving service of the Lord and realizes the Lord because of his attitude of service.

<div class="First">In his commentary to this verse, &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura uses the word <span class="Italic">durvij&ntilde;eyam,</span> which means &ldquo;very difficult to realize.&rdquo; The pure stage of existence is described in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index49d1.html?g=2712">7.28</a>), wherein K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says:</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful actions are completely eradicated and who are freed from the duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service with determination.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">Elsewhere in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index6a3d.html?g=3111">9.14</a>) the Lord says:</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Always chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing down before Me, these great souls perpetually worship Me with devotion.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">One can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead after transcending all material impediments. Therefore Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a also says in the <span class="Ref_Italic">G&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index7428.html?g=2487">7.3</a>):</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">To understand K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one must undergo severe penances and austerities, but since the path of devotional service is perfect, by following this process one can very easily come to the spiritual platform and understand the Lord. This, too, is confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexbf7d.html?g=5898">18.55</a>), wherein K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says:</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;One can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is only by devotional service. And when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">Thus although the subject matter is <span class="Italic">durvij&ntilde;eyam,</span> extremely difficult to understand, it becomes easy if one follows the prescribed method. Coming in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead is possible through pure devotional service, which begins with <span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;a&#7745; k&#299;rtana&#7745; vi&#7779;&#7751;o&#7717; </I>[SB </span></I><a href="indexda76.html?g=55355">7.5.23</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> In this regard, &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura quotes a verse from <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="indexd9e6.html?g=15683">2.8.5</a>): <span class="Italic">pravi&#7779;&#7789;a&#7717; kar&#7751;a-randhre&#7751;a sv&#257;n&#257;&#7745; bh&#257;va-saroruham.</span> The process of hearing and chanting enters the core of the heart, and in this way one becomes a pure devotee. By continuing this process, one comes to the stage of transcendental love, and then he appreciates the transcendental name, form, qualities and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, a pure devotee, by devotional service, is able to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead despite many material impediments, which are all various energies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Easily making his way through these impediments, a devotee comes directly in contact with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. After all, the material impediments described in these verses are but various energies of the Lord. When a devotee is eager to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he prays to the Lord:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">ayi nanda-tanuja ki&#7749;kara&#7745;<br>patita&#7745; m&#257;&#7745; vi&#7779;ame bhav&#257;mbudhau<br>k&#7771;pay&#257; tava p&#257;da-pa&#7749;kaja-<br>sthita-dh&#363;l&#299;-sad&#7771;&#347;a&#7745; vicintaya</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;O son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Nanda [K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a], I am Your eternal servitor, yet somehow or other I have fallen into the ocean of birth and death. Please pick me up from this ocean of death and place me as one of the atoms at Your lotus feet.&rdquo; Being pleased with the devotee, the Lord turns all his material impediments into spiritual service. In this connection &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura quotes a verse from the <span class="Italic">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u Pur&#257;&#7751;a:</span></div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">hl&#257;din&#299; sandhin&#299; samvit<br>tvayy ek&#257; sarva-sa&#7745;sthitau<br>hl&#257;da-t&#257;pa-kar&#299; mi&#347;r&#257;<br>tvayi no gu&#7751;a-varjite</div>
</div><A NAME="77615"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">In the material world, the spiritual energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is manifested as <span class="Italic">t&#257;pa-kar&#299;,</span> which means &ldquo;causing miseries.&rdquo; Everyone hankers for happiness, but although happiness originally comes from the pleasure potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in the material world, because of material activities, the pleasure potency of the Lord becomes a source of miseries (<span class="Italic">hl&#257;da-t&#257;pa-kar&#299;</span>). False happiness in the material world is the source of distress, but when one&rsquo;s endeavors for happiness are redirected toward the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this <span class="Italic">t&#257;pa-kar&#299;</span> element of misery is vanquished. An example given in this connection is that extracting fire from wood is certainly difficult, but when the fire comes out it burns the wood to ashes. In other words, experiencing the Supreme Personality of Godhead is extremely difficult for those devoid of devotional service, but everything becomes easier for a devotee, and thus he can very easily meet the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="Purport">Here the prayers say that the form of the Lord is beyond the jurisdiction of material form and is therefore inconceivable. A devotee prays, however, &ldquo;My dear Lord, be pleased with me so that I may very easily see Your transcendental form and potency.&rdquo; Nondevotees try to understand the Supreme Brahman by discussions of <span class="Italic">neti neti.</span> <span class="Italic">Ni&#7779;edha-nirv&#257;&#7751;a-sukh&#257;nubh&#363;ti&#7717;:</span> a devotee, however, simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord, avoids such laborious speculations and realizes the existence of the Lord very easily.</div>

<div class="Translation">Anything expressed by material vibrations, anything ascertained by material intelligence and anything experienced by the material senses or concocted within the material mind is but an effect of the modes of material nature and therefore has nothing to do with the real nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Lord is beyond the creation of this material world, for He is the source of the material qualities and creation.

The Supreme Lord is the creator of everything, and this means that He existed when there was no creation. In other words, His name, form and qualities are not materially created entities; they are transcendental always. Therefore by our material concoctions, vibrations and thoughts we cannot ascertain the Supreme Lord. This is explained in the verse <span class="Italic">ata&#7717; &#347;r&#299;-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-n&#257;m&#257;di na bhaved gr&#257;hyam indriyai&#7717;</span> [BRS. <PW:Popup,7.03125,2.58333,Popup><div class="Verse">ata&#7717; &#347;r&#299;-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-n&#257;m&#257;di<br>na bhaved gr&#257;hyam indriyai&#7717;<br>sevonmukhe hi jihv&#257;dau<br>svayam eva sphuraty ada&#7717;</div></div>

N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a is always transcendental, beyond this material creation. How can He become <span class="Italic">daridra-n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</span>? Poverty is found within this material world, but in the spiritual world, there is no such thing as poverty. Therefore the idea of <span class="Italic">daridra-n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</span> is merely a concoction.</div>
<div class="Purport">Dak&#7779;a very carefully points out that material designations cannot be names of the worshipable Lord: <span class="Italic">yad yan nirukta&#7745; vacas&#257; nir&#363;pitam.</span> <span class="Italic">Nirukta</span> refers to the Vedic dictionary. One cannot properly understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead merely by picking up expressions from a dictionary. In praying to the Lord, Dak&#7779;a does not wish material names and forms to be the objects of his worship; rather, he wants to worship the Lord, who existed before the creation of material dictionaries and names. As confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Vedas, yato v&#257;co nivartante/ apr&#257;pya manas&#257; saha:</span> the name, form, attributes and paraphernalia of the Lord cannot be ascertained through a material dictionary. However, if one reaches the transcendental platform of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he becomes well acquainted with everything, material and spiritual. This is confirmed in another Vedic <span class="Italic">mantra:</span> <span class="Italic">tam eva viditv&#257;ti m&#7771;tyum eti.</span> If one can somehow or other, by the grace of the Lord, understand the transcendental position of the Lord, one becomes eternal.

Thus He creates within this material world a situation in which they are unable to come to a conclusion. I offer my obeisances unto Him.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Since time immemorial or since the creation of the cosmic manifestation, the conditioned souls have formed various parties of philosophical speculation, but this is not true of the devotees. Nondevotees have different ideas of creation, maintenance and annihilation, and therefore they are called <span class="Italic">v&#257;d&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">prativ&#257;d&#299;s</span>&mdash;proponents and counterproponents. It is understood from the statement of <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> that there are many <span class="Italic">munis,</span> or speculators:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">tarko &rsquo;prati&#7779;&#7789;ha&#7717; &#347;rutayo vibhinn&#257;<br>n&#257;s&#257;v &#7771;&#7779;ir yasya mata&#7745; na bhinnam</div>
</div><A NAME="77672"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">All speculators must disagree with other speculators; otherwise, why should there be so many opposing parties concerned with ascertaining the supreme cause?</div>
<div class="Purport">Philosophy means finding the ultimate cause. As <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra</span> very reasonably says, <span class="Italic">ath&#257;to brahma jij&ntilde;&#257;s&#257;:</span> human life is meant for understanding the ultimate cause. Devotees accept that the ultimate cause is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a because this conclusion is supported by all Vedic literature and also by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself, who says, <span class="Italic">aha&#7745; sarvasya prabhava&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;I am the source of everything.&rdquo; Devotees have no problem understanding the ultimate cause of everything, but nondevotees must face many opposing elements because everyone who wants to be a prominent philosopher invents his own way. In India there are many parties of philosophers, such as the <span class="Italic">dvaita-v&#257;d&#299;s, advaita-v&#257;d&#299;s, vai&#347;e&#7779;ikas, m&#299;m&#257;&#7745;sakas,</span> M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s and <span class="Italic">svabh&#257;va-v&#257;d&#299;s,</span> and each of them opposes the others. Similarly, in the Western countries there are also many philosophers with different views of creation, life, maintenance and annihilation. Thus it is undoubtedly a fact that there are countless philosophers throughout the world, each of them contradicting the others.</div>
<div class="Purport">Now, one might ask why there are so many philosophers if the ultimate goal of philosophy is one. Undoubtedly the ultimate cause is one&mdash;the Supreme Brahman. As Arjuna told K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index1ba6.html?g=3396">10.12</a>):</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">There are two parties&mdash;namely, the theists and the atheists. The theist, who accepts the Supersoul, finds the spiritual cause through mystic yoga. The S&#257;&#7749;khyite, however, who merely analyzes the material elements, comes to a conclusion of impersonalism and does not accept a supreme cause&mdash;whether Bhagav&#257;n, Param&#257;tm&#257; or even Brahman. Instead, he is preoccupied with the superfluous, external activities of material nature. Ultimately, however, both parties demonstrate the Absolute Truth because although they offer opposing statements, their object is the same ultimate cause. They are both approaching the same Supreme Brahman, to whom I offer my respectful obeisances.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Actually there are two sides to this argument. Some say that the Absolute has no form (<span class="Italic">nir&#257;k&#257;ra</span>), and others say that the Absolute has a form (<span class="Italic">s&#257;k&#257;ra</span>). Therefore the word <span class="Italic">form</span> is the common factor, although some accept it (<span class="Italic">asti</span> or <span class="Italic">astika</span>) whereas others try to negate it (<span class="Italic">n&#257;sti</span> or <span class="Italic">n&#257;stika</span>). Since the devotee considers the word &ldquo;form&rdquo; (<span class="Italic">&#257;k&#257;ra</span>) the common factor for both, he offers his respectful obeisances to the form, although others may go on arguing about whether the Absolute has a form or not.</div>
<div class="Purport">In this verse the word <span class="Italic">yoga-s&#257;&#7749;khyayo&#7717;</span> is very important. <span class="Italic">Yoga</span> means <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> because <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> also accept the existence of the all-pervading Supreme Soul and try to see that Supreme Soul within their hearts. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (12.13.1), <span class="Italic">dhy&#257;n&#257;vasthita-tad-gatena manas&#257; pa&#347;yanti ya&#7745; yogina&#7717;.</span> The devotee tries to come directly in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whereas the <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> tries to find the Supersoul within the heart by meditation. Thus, both directly and indirectly, <span class="Italic">yoga</span> means <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> S&#257;&#7749;khya, however, means physical study of the cosmic situation through speculative knowledge. This is generally known as <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na-&#347;&#257;stra.</span> The S&#257;&#7749;khyites are attached to the impersonal Brahman, but the Absolute Truth is known in three ways. <span class="Italic">Brahmeti param&#257;tmeti bhagav&#257;n iti &#347;abdyate:</span> the Absolute Truth is one, but some accept Him as impersonal Brahman, some as the Supersoul existing everywhere, and some as Bhagav&#257;n, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The central point is the Absolute Truth.</div>
<div class="Purport">Although the impersonalists and personalists fight with one another, they focus upon the same Parabrahman, the same Absolute Truth. In the <span class="Italic">yoga-&#347;&#257;stras,</span> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is described as follows: <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&#7745; pi&#347;a&#7749;g&#257;mbaram ambujek&#7779;a&#7751;a&#7745; catur-bhuja&#7745; &#347;a&#7749;kha-gad&#257;dy-ud&#257;yudham.</span> Thus the pleasing appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead&rsquo;s bodily features, His limbs and His dress are described. The <span class="Italic">s&#257;&#7749;khya-&#347;&#257;stra,</span> however, denies the existence of the Lord&rsquo;s transcendental form. The <span class="Italic">s&#257;&#7749;khya-&#347;&#257;stra</span> says that the Supreme Absolute Truth has no hands, no legs and no name: <span class="Italic">hy an&#257;ma-r&#363;pa-gu&#7751;a-p&#257;&#7751;i-p&#257;dam acak&#7779;ur a&#347;rotram ekam advit&#299;yam api n&#257;ma-r&#363;p&#257;dika&#7745; n&#257;sti.</span> The Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras</span> say, <span class="Italic">ap&#257;&#7751;i-p&#257;do javano grah&#299;t&#257;:</span> the Supreme Lord has no legs and hands, but He can accept whatever is offered to Him. Actually such statements accept that the Supreme has hands and legs, but deny that He has material hands and legs. This is why the Absolute is called <span class="Italic">apr&#257;k&#7771;ta.</span> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has a <span class="Italic">sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha</span><I> <span class="Italic"></I>[</I>Bs. </span>5.1</I>]<span class="Italic"></I>,</span> a form of eternity, knowledge and bliss, not a material form. The S&#257;&#7749;khyites, or <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s,</span> deny the material form, and the devotees also know very well that the Absolute Truth, Bhagav&#257;n, has no material form.</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">&#299;&#347;vara&#7717; parama&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&#7717;<br>sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha&#7717;<br>an&#257;dir &#257;dir govinda&#7717;<br>sarva-k&#257;ra&#7751;a-k&#257;ra&#7751;am<br><span class="Italic"></I>[</I>Bs. </span>5.1</I>]</I></div>
</div><A NAME="77700"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who is known as Govinda, is the supreme controller. He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other origin, for He is the prime cause of all causes.&rdquo; The conception of the Absolute without hands and legs and the conception of the Absolute with hands and legs are apparently contradictory, but they both coincide with the same truth about the Supreme Absolute Person. Therefore the word <span class="Italic">vastu-ni&#7779;&#7789;hayo&#7717;,</span> which is used herein, indicates that both the <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> and S&#257;&#7749;khyites have faith in the reality, but are arguing about it from the different viewpoints of material and spiritual identities. Parabrahman, or <span class="Italic">b&#7771;hat,</span> is the common point. The S&#257;&#7749;khyites and <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> are both situated in that same Brahman, but they differ because of different angles of vision.</div>
<div class="Purport">The directions given by the <span class="Italic">bhakti-&#347;&#257;stra</span> point one in the perfect direction because the Supreme Personality of Godhead says in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> <span class="Italic">bhakty&#257; m&#257;m abhij&#257;n&#257;ti:</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexbf7d.html?g=5898">18.55</a>] &ldquo;Only by devotional service am I to be known.&rdquo; The <span class="Italic">bhaktas</span> know that the Supreme Person has no material form, whereas the <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s</span> simply deny the material form. One should therefore take shelter of the <span class="Italic">bhakti-m&#257;rga,</span> the path of devotion; then everything will be clear. <span class="Italic">J&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s</span> concentrate on the <span class="Italic">vir&#257;&#7789;-r&#363;pa,</span> the gigantic universal form of the Lord. This is a good system in the beginning for those who are extremely materialistic, but there is no need to think continuously of the <span class="Italic">vir&#257;&#7789;-r&#363;pa.</span> When Arjuna was shown the <span class="Italic">vir&#257;&#7789;-r&#363;pa</span> of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, he saw it, but he did not want to see it perpetually. He therefore requested the Lord to return to His original form as two-armed K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. In conclusion, learned scholars find no contradictions in the devotees&rsquo; concentration upon the spiritual form of the Lord (<span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;vara&#7717; parama&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&#7717; sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha&#7717; </I>[</I>Bs. </span>5.1</I>]</I>). In this regard, &#346;r&#299;la Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya says that less intelligent nondevotees think that their conclusion is the ultimate, but because devotees are completely learned, they can understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is inconceivably opulent, who is devoid of all material names, forms and pastimes, and who is all-pervading, is especially merciful to the devotees who worship His lotus feet. Thus He exhibits transcendental forms and names with His different pastimes. May that Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose form is eternal and full of knowledge and bliss, be merciful to me.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In regard to the significant word <span class="Italic">an&#257;ma-r&#363;pa&#7717;,</span> &#346;r&#299; &#346;r&#299;dhara Sv&#257;m&#299; says, <span class="Italic">pr&#257;k&#7771;ta-n&#257;ma-r&#363;pa-rahito &rsquo;pi.</span> The word <span class="Italic">an&#257;ma,</span> which means &ldquo;having no name,&rdquo; indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead has no material name. Simply by chanting the name of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a to call his son, Aj&#257;mila attained salvation. This means that N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a is not an ordinary mundane name; it is nonmaterial. The word <span class="Italic">an&#257;ma,</span> therefore, indicates that the names of the Supreme Lord do not belong to this material world. The vibration of the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra</span> is not a material sound, and similarly the form of the Lord and His appearance and activities are all nonmaterial. To show His causeless mercy to the devotees, as well as to the nondevotees, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appears in this material world with names, forms and pastimes, all of which are transcendental. Unintelligent men who cannot understand this think that these names, forms and pastimes are material, and therefore they deny that He has a name or a form.</div>
<div class="Purport">Considered with scrutiny, the conclusion of nondevotees, who say that God has no name, and that of devotees, who know that His name is not material, are practically the same. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no material name, form, birth, appearance or disappearance, but nevertheless, He takes His birth (<span class="Italic">janma</span>). As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index333e.html?g=1478">4.6</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">ajo &rsquo;pi sann avyay&#257;tm&#257;<br>bh&#363;t&#257;n&#257;m &#299;&#347;varo &rsquo;pi san<br>prak&#7771;ti&#7745; sv&#257;m adhi&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;ya<br>sambhav&#257;my &#257;tma-m&#257;yay&#257;</div>
</div><A NAME="77718"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">Although the Lord is unborn (<span class="Italic">aja</span>) and His body never undergoes material changes, He nevertheless appears as an incarnation, maintaining Himself always in the transcendental stage (<span class="Italic">&#347;uddha-sattva</span>). Thus He exhibits His transcendental forms, names and activities. That is His special mercy toward His devotees. Others may continue merely arguing about whether the Absolute Truth has form or not, but when a devotee, by the grace of the Lord, sees the Lord personally, he becomes spiritually ecstatic.</div>
<div class="Purport">Unintelligent persons say that the Lord does nothing. Actually He has nothing to do, but nevertheless He has to do everything, because without His sanction no one can do anything. The unintelligent, however, cannot see how He is working and how the entire material nature is working under His direction. His different potencies work perfectly.</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">na tasya k&#257;rya&#7745; kara&#7751;a&#7745; ca vidyate<br>na tat-sama&#347; c&#257;bhyadhika&#347; ca d&#7771;&#347;yate<br>par&#257;sya &#347;aktir vividhaiva &#347;r&#363;yate<br>sv&#257;bh&#257;vik&#299; j&ntilde;&#257;na-bala-kriy&#257; ca</div>

<div class="VerseRef">(<span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;vet&#257;&#347;vatara Upani&#7779;ad</span> 6.8)</div>
<div class="After-Verse">He has nothing to do personally, for since His potencies are perfect, everything is immediately done by His will. Persons to whom the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not revealed cannot see how He is working, and therefore they think that even if there is God, He has nothing to do or has no particular name.</div>
<div class="Purport">Actually the Lord&rsquo;s name already exists because of His transcendental activities. The Lord is sometimes called <span class="Italic">gu&#7751;a-karma-n&#257;ma</span> because He is named according to His transcendental activities. For example, <span class="Italic">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</span> means &ldquo;all-attractive.&rdquo; This is the Lord&rsquo;s name because His transcendental qualities make Him very attractive. As a small boy He lifted Govardhana Hill, and in His childhood He killed many demons. Such activities are very attractive, and therefore He is sometimes called Giridh&#257;r&#299;, Madhus&#363;dana, Agha-ni&#7779;&#363;dana and so on. Because He acted as the son of Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, He is called Nanda-tanuja. These names already exist, but since nondevotees cannot understand the names of the Lord, He is sometimes called <span class="Italic">an&#257;ma,</span> or nameless. This means that He has no material names. All His activities are spiritual, and therefore He has spiritual names.</div>
<div class="Purport">Generally, less intelligent men are under the impression that the Lord has no form. Therefore He appears in His original form as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, <span class="Italic">sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha<I></span> </I><span class="Italic">[</I>Bs. </span>5.1</I>]</I><span class="Italic">,</span> to carry out His mission of participating in the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra and pastimes to protect the devotees and vanquish the demons (<span class="Italic">paritr&#257;&#7751;&#257;ya s&#257;dh&#363;n&#257;&#7745; vin&#257;&#347;&#257;ya ca du&#7779;k&#7771;t&#257;m</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexb53f.html?g=1496">4.8</a>]). This is His mercy. For those who think that He has no form and no work to do, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a comes to show that indeed He works. He works so gloriously that no one else can perform such uncommon acts. Although He appeared as a human being, He married 16,108 wives, which is impossible for a human being to do. The Lord performs such activities to show people how great He is, how affectionate He is and how merciful He is. Although His original name is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (<span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;as tu bhagav&#257;n svayam</span>), He acts in unlimited ways, and therefore according to His work He has many, many thousands of names.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">As the air carries various characteristics of the physical elements, like the aroma of a flower or colors resulting from a mixture of dust in the air, the Lord appears through lower systems of worship according to one&rsquo;s desires, although He appears as the demigods and not in His original form. What is the use of these other forms? May the original Supreme Personality of Godhead please fulfill my desires.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The impersonalists imagine the various demigods to be forms of the Lord. For example, the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s worship five demigods (<span class="Italic">pa&ntilde;cop&#257;san&#257;</span>). They do not actually believe in the form of the Lord, but for the sake of worship they imagine some form to be God. Generally they imagine a form of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, a form of &#346;iva, and forms of Ga&#7751;e&#347;a, the sun-god and Durg&#257;. This is called <span class="Italic">pa&ntilde;cop&#257;san&#257;.</span> Dak&#7779;a, however, wanted to worship not an imaginary form, but the supreme form of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>
<div class="Purport">In this regard, &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura describes the difference between the Supreme Personality of Godhead and an ordinary living being. As pointed out in a previous verse, <span class="Italic">sarva&#7745; pum&#257;n veda gu&#7751;&#257;&#7745;&#347; ca taj-j&ntilde;o na veda sarva j&ntilde;am anantam &#299;&#7693;e:</span> the omnipotent Supreme Lord knows everything, but the living being does not actually know the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> &ldquo;I know everything, but no one knows Me.&rdquo; This is the difference between the Supreme Lord and an ordinary living being. In a prayer in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> Queen Kunt&#299; says, &ldquo;My dear Lord, You exist inside and outside, yet no one can see You.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">The conditioned soul cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by speculative knowledge or by imagination. One must therefore know the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He reveals Himself, but He cannot be understood by speculation. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (10.14.29):</div>

<div class="Purport">This is the verdict of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra.</span> An ordinary man may be a great philosopher and may speculate upon what the Absolute Truth is, what His form is and where He is existing, but be cannot understand these truths. <span class="Italic">Sevonmukhe hi jihv&#257;dau svayam eva sphuraty ada&#7717;:</span> one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead only through devotional service. This is also explained by the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexbf7d.html?g=5898">18.55</a>). <span class="Italic">Bhakty&#257; m&#257;m abhij&#257;n&#257;ti y&#257;v&#257;n ya&#347; c&#257;smi tattvata&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;One can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is only by devotional service.&rdquo; Unintelligent persons want to imagine or concoct a form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but devotees want to worship the actual Personality of Godhead. Therefore Dak&#7779;a prays, &ldquo;One may think of You as personal, impersonal or imaginary, but I wish to pray to Your Lordship that You fulfill my desires to see You as You actually are.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura comments that this verse is especially meant for the impersonalist, who thinks that he himself is the Supreme because there is no difference between the living being and God. The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosopher thinks that there is only one Supreme Truth and that he is also that Supreme Truth. Actually this is not knowledge but foolishness, and this verse is especially meant for such fools, whose knowledge has been stolen by illusion (<span class="Italic">m&#257;yay&#257;pah&#7771;ta j&ntilde;&#257;n&#257;&#7717;</span>). Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura says that such persons, <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;ni-m&#257;nina&#7717;,</span> think themselves very advanced, but actually they are unintelligent.</div>
<div class="Purport">In regard to this verse, &#346;r&#299;la Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">svadeha-stha&#7745; hari&#7745; pr&#257;hur<br>adham&#257; j&#299;vam eva tu<br>madhyam&#257;&#347; c&#257;py anir&#7751;&#299;ta&#7745;<br>j&#299;v&#257;d bhinna&#7745; jan&#257;rdanam</div>
</div><A NAME="77747"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">There are three classes of men&mdash;the lowest (<span class="Italic">adhama</span>), those in the middle (<span class="Italic">madhyama</span>), and the best (<span class="Italic">uttama</span>). The lowest (<span class="Italic">adhama</span>) think that there is no difference between God and the living entity except that the living entity is under designations whereas the Absolute Truth has no designations. In their opinion, as soon as the designations of the material body are dissolved, the <span class="Italic">j&#299;va,</span> the living entity, will mix with the Supreme. They give the argument of <span class="Italic">gha&#7789;&#257;k&#257;&#347;a-pa&#7789;&#257;k&#257;&#347;a,</span> in which the body is compared to a pot with the sky within and the sky without. When the pot breaks, the sky inside becomes one with the sky outside, and so the impersonalists say that the living being becomes one with the Supreme. This is their argument, but &#346;r&#299;la Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya says that such an argument is put forward by the lowest class of men. Another class of men cannot ascertain what the actual form of the Supreme is, but they agree that there is a Supreme who controls the activities of the ordinary living being. Such philosophers are accepted as mediocre. The best, however. are those who understand the Supreme Lord (<span class="Italic">sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha<I></span> </I><span class="Italic">[</I>Bs. </span>5.1</I>]</I>). <span class="Italic">P&#363;r&#7751;&#257;nand&#257;di-gu&#7751;aka&#7745; sarva j&#299;va-vilak&#7779;a&#7751;am:</span> His form is completely spiritual, full of bliss, and completely distinct from that of the conditioned soul or any other living entity. <span class="Italic">Uttam&#257;s tu hari&#7745; pr&#257;hus t&#257;ratamyena te&#7779;u ca:</span> such philosophers are the best because they know that the Supreme Personality of Godhead reveals Himself differently to worshipers in various modes of material nature. They know that there are thirty-three million demigods just to convince the conditioned soul that there is a supreme power and to induce him to agree to worship one of these demigods so that by the association of devotees he may be able to understand that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> <span class="Italic">matta&#7717; paratara&#7745; n&#257;nyat ki&ntilde;cid asti dhana&ntilde;jaya:</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexef42.html?g=2523">7.7</a>] &ldquo;There is no truth superior to Me.&rdquo; <span class="Italic">Aham &#257;dir hi dev&#257;n&#257;m:</span> &ldquo;I am the origin of all the demigods.&rdquo; <span class="Italic">Aha&#7745; sarvasya prabhava&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;I am superior to everyone, even Lord Brahm&#257;, Lord &#346;iva and the other demigods.&rdquo; These are the conclusions of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra,</span> and one who accepts these conclusions should be considered a first-class philosopher. Such a philosopher knows that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Lord of the demigods (<span class="Italic">deva-deve&#347;vara&#7745; s&#363;tram &#257;nanda&#7745; pr&#257;&#7751;a-vedina&#7717;</span>).</div>

O Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, best of the Kuru dynasty, the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet rested on the shoulders of His carrier, Garu&#7693;a, and He appeared with eight long, mighty, very beautiful arms. In His hands He held a disc, conchshell, sword, shield, arrow, bow, rope and club&mdash;in each hand a different weapon, all brilliantly shining. His garments were yellow and His bodily hue deep bluish. His eyes and face were very cheerful, and from His neck to His feet hung a long garland of flowers. His chest was decorated with the Kaustubha jewel and the mark of &#346;r&#299;vatsa. On His head was a gorgeous round helmet, and His ears were decorated with earrings resembling sharks. All these ornaments were uncommonly beautiful. The Lord wore a golden belt on His waist, bracelets on His arms, rings on His fingers, and ankle bells on His feet. Thus decorated by various ornaments, Lord Hari, who is attractive to all the living entities of the three worlds, is known as Puru&#7779;ottama, the best personality. He was accompanied by great devotees like N&#257;rada, Nanda and all the principal demigods, led by the heavenly king, Indra, and the residents of various upper planetary systems such as Siddhaloka, Gandharvaloka and C&#257;ra&#7751;aloka. Situated on both sides of the Lord and behind Him as well, these devotees offered Him prayers continuously.</div>

<div class="Translation">My dear Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a, you have performed extreme austerities for the welfare and growth of the world. My desire also is that everyone within this world be happy. I am therefore very pleased with you because you are endeavoring to fulfill My desire for the welfare of the entire world.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">After every dissolution of the material cosmos, all the living entities take shelter in the body of K&#257;ra&#7751;odaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and when creation takes place again, they come forth from His body in their various species to resume their activities. Why does the creation take place in such a way that the living entities are put into conditioned life to suffer the threefold miseries imposed upon them by the material nature? Here the Lord says to Dak&#7779;a, &ldquo;You desire to benefit all living entities, and that is also My desire.&rdquo; The living entities who come in contact with the material world are meant to be corrected. All the living entities within this material world have revolted against the service of the Lord, and therefore they remain within this material world as ever conditioned, <span class="Italic">nitya-baddha,</span> taking birth again and again. There is a chance, of course, of their being liberated, but nevertheless the conditioned souls, not taking advantage of this opportunity, continue in a life of sense enjoyment, and thus they are punished by birth and death again and again. This is the law of nature. As the Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexd990.html?g=2586">7.14</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">daiv&#299; hy e&#7779;&#257; gu&#7751;a-may&#299;<br>mama m&#257;y&#257; duratyay&#257;<br>m&#257;m eva ye prapadyante<br>m&#257;y&#257;m et&#257;&#7745; taranti te</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it.&rdquo; Elsewhere in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index6669.html?g=4886">15.7</a>) the Lord says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">mamaiv&#257;&#7745;&#347;o j&#299;va-loke<br>j&#299;va-bh&#363;ta&#7717; san&#257;tana&#7717;<br>mana&#7717; &#7779;a&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;n&#299;ndriy&#257;&#7751;i<br>prak&#7771;ti-sth&#257;ni kar&#7779;ati</div>
</div><A NAME="77851"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.&rdquo; The living entity&rsquo;s struggle for existence within the material world is due to his rebellious nature. Unless a living entity surrenders to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, he must continue this life of struggle.</div>
<div class="Purport">The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is not a fad. It is a bona fide movement intended to promote the welfare of all conditioned souls by trying to elevate everyone to the platform of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. If one does not come to this platform, he must continue in material existence perpetually, sometimes in the upper planets and sometimes in the lower planets. As confirmed in <span class="Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Madhya</span> <a href="indexe291.html?g=125654">20.118</a>), <span class="Italic">kabhu svarge u&#7789;h&#257;ya, kabhu narake &#7693;ub&#257;ya:</span> the conditioned soul sometimes descends into nescience and sometimes gets some relief by being relatively freed from it. This is the life of the conditioned soul.</div>
<div class="Purport">Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a is trying to benefit the conditioned souls by begetting them to give them a life with a chance for liberation. Liberation means surrender to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. If one begets children with the purpose of training them to surrender to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, fatherhood is very good. Similarly, when the spiritual master trains the conditioned souls to become K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious, his position is successful. If one gives the conditioned souls a chance to become K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious, all his activities are approved by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is extremely pleased, as stated here (<span class="Italic">pr&#299;to &rsquo;ham</span>). Following the examples of the previous <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas,</span> all the members of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement should try to benefit the conditioned souls by inducing them to become K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious and giving them all facilities to do so. Such activities constitute real welfare work. By such activities, a preacher or anyone who endeavors to spread K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness is recognized by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As the Lord Himself confirms in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index2d38.html?g=6015">18.68</a>&ndash;69):</div>

<div class="First">There are various types of incarnations or expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Although Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a is not on the same level as Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord &#346;iva, he is compared to them because he engages in the service of the Lord. In the service of the Personality of Godhead, it is not that Lord Brahm&#257; is considered very great while an ordinary human being trying to preach the glories of the Lord is considered very low. There are no such distinctions. Regardless of whether materially high or materially low, anyone engaged in the service of the Lord is spiritually very dear to Him.

<div class="Translation">My dear br&#257;hma&#7751;a, austerity in the form of meditation is My heart, Vedic knowledge in the form of hymns and mantras constitutes My body, and spiritual activities and ecstatic emotions are My actual form.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Sometimes atheists argue that since God is invisible to their eyes, they do not believe in God. For them the Supreme Lord is describing a method by which one can see God in His impersonal form. Intelligent persons can see God in His personal form, as stated in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras,</span> but if one is very eager to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead immediately, face to face, he can see the Supreme Lord through this description, which portrays the various internal and external parts of His body.</div>
<div class="Purport">To engage in <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> or denial of material activities, is the first principle of spiritual life.

In this way one can see how God is existing and how everything is managed perfectly because of the presence of the Supreme Lord.

<div class="Translation">Now unite in sexual life as man and woman, and in this way, by sexual intercourse, you will be able to beget hundreds of children in the womb of this girl to increase the population.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexbe66.html?g=2559">7.11</a>), <span class="Italic">dharm&#257;viruddho bh&#363;te&#7779;u k&#257;mo &rsquo;smi:</span> &ldquo;I am sex that is not contrary to religious principles.&rdquo; Sexual intercourse ordained by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> a religious principle, but it is not intended for sense enjoyment. Indulgence in sense enjoyment through sexual intercourse is not allowed by the Vedic principles. One may follow the natural tendency for sex life only to beget children. Therefore the Lord told Dak&#7779;a in this verse, &ldquo;This girl is offered to you only for sex life to beget children, not for any other purpose. She is very fertile, and therefore you will be able to have as many children as you can beget.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura remarks in this connection that Dak&#7779;a was given the facility for unlimited sexual intercourse. In Dak&#7779;a&rsquo;s previous life he was also known as Dak&#7779;a, but in the course of performing sacrifices he offended Lord &#346;iva, and thus his head was replaced with that of a goat. Then Dak&#7779;a gave up his life because of his degraded condition, but because he maintained the same unlimited sexual desires, he underwent austerities by which he satisfied the Supreme Lord, who then gave him unlimited potency for sexual intercourse.</div>
<div class="Purport">It should be noted that although such a facility for sexual intercourse is achieved by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this facility is not offered to advanced devotees, who are free from material desires (<span class="Italic">any&#257;bhil&#257;&#7779;it&#257;-&#347;&#363;nyam</span></I> [Madhya </I><a href="index9f17.html?g=124267">19.167</a></I>]</I>). In this connection it may be noted that if the American boys and girls engaged in the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement want to advance in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness to achieve the supreme benefit of loving service to the Lord, they should refrain from indulging in this facility for sex life. Therefore we advise that one should at least refrain from illicit sex. Even if there are opportunities for sex life, one should voluntarily accept the limitation of having sex only for progeny, not for any other purpose. Kardama Muni was also given the facility for sex life, but he had only a slight desire for it. Therefore after begetting children in the womb of Devah&#363;ti, Kardama Muni became completely renounced. The purport is that if one wants to return home, back to Godhead, one should voluntarily refrain from sex life. Sex should be accepted only as much as needed, not unlimitedly.</div>
<div class="Purport">One should not think that Dak&#7779;a received the favor of the Lord by receiving the facilities for unlimited sex. Later verses will reveal that Dak&#7779;a again committed an offense, this time at the lotus feet of N&#257;rada. Therefore although sex life is the topmost enjoyment in the material world and although one may have an opportunity for sexual enjoyment by the grace of God, this entails a risk of committing offenses. Dak&#7779;a was open to such offenses, and therefore, strictly speaking, he was not actually favored by the Supreme Lord. One should not seek the favor of the Lord for unlimited potency in sex life.</div>

These sons, who were all of the same character and mentality, were known as the Harya&#347;vas. Ordered by their father to create more and more population, the Harya&#347;vas went west to the place where the River Sindhu (now the Indus) meets the Arabian Sea. In those days this was the site of a holy lake named N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a-saras, where there were many saintly persons. The Harya&#347;vas began practicing austerities, penances and meditation, which are the engagements of the highly exalted renounced order of life.

<div class="Translation">The great sage N&#257;rada said: My dear Harya&#347;vas, you have not seen the extremities of the earth. There is a kingdom where only one man lives and where there is a hole from which, having entered, no one emerges. A woman there who is extremely unchaste adorns herself with various attractive dresses, and the man who lives there is her husband. In that kingdom, there is a river flowing in both directions, a wonderful home made of twenty-five materials, a swan that vibrates various sounds, and an automatically revolving object made of sharp razors and thunderbolts. You have not seen all this, and therefore you are inexperienced boys without advanced knowledge. How, then, will you create progeny?</div>

<div class="First">N&#257;rada Muni saw that the boys known as the Harya&#347;vas were already purified because of living in that holy place and were practically ready for liberation. Why then should they be encouraged to become entangled in family life, which is so dark that once having entered it one cannot leave it? Through this analogy, N&#257;rada Muni asked them to consider why they should follow their father&rsquo;s order to be entangled in family life. Indirectly, he asked them to find within the cores of their hearts the situation of the Supersoul, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, for then they would truly be experienced. In other words, one who is too involved in his material environment and does not look within the core of his heart is increasingly entangled in the illusory energy. N&#257;rada Muni&rsquo;s purpose was to get the sons of Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a to divert their attention toward spiritual realization instead of involving themselves in the ordinary but complicated affairs of propagation. The same advice was given by Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja to his father (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="indexd2be.html?g=55189">7.5.5</a>):</div>

<div class="Translation">[The Harya&#347;vas understood the meaning of N&#257;rada&rsquo;s words as follows.] The word &ldquo;bh&#363;&#7717;&rdquo; [&ldquo;the earth&rdquo;] refers to the field of activities. The material body, which is a result of the living being&rsquo;s actions, is his field of activities, and it gives him false designations. Since time immemorial, he has received various types of material bodies, which are the roots of bondage to the material world. If one foolishly engages in temporary fruitive activities and does not look toward the cessation of this bondage, what will be the benefit of his actions?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">N&#257;rada Muni spoke to the Harya&#347;vas, the sons of Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a, about ten allegorical subjects&mdash;the king, the kingdom, the river, the house, the physical elements and so forth. After considering these by themselves, the Harya&#347;vas could understand that the living entity encaged in his body seeks happiness, but takes no interest in how to become free from his encagement. This is a very important verse, since all the living entities in the material world are very active, having obtained their particular types of bodies. A man works all day and night for sense gratification, and animals like hogs and dogs also work for sense gratification all day and night. Birds, beasts and all other conditioned living entities engage in various activities without knowledge of the soul encaged within the body. Especially in the human form of body, one&rsquo;s duty is to act in such a way that he can release himself from his encagement, but without the instructions of N&#257;rada or his representative in the disciplic succession, people blindly engage in bodily activities to enjoy <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;-sukha</span>&mdash;flickering, temporary happiness. They do not know how to become free from their material encagement. &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva therefore said that such activity is not at all good, since it encages the soul again and again in a body subjected to the threefold miseries of the material condition.</div>

The intelligence engaged to attract a man to the lower part of the body is the intelligence of a professional prostitute. Similarly, the intelligence of a living entity who does not turn his attention toward K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a or the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement simply changes dresses like a prostitute.

One should seriously study the facts concerning creation, maintenance and devastation, as well as the permanent place from which one never need return (<span class="Italic">yad gatv&#257; na nivartante </I>[Bg. </I><a href="index34f4.html?g=4877">15.6</a></I>]</I></span>). Human society should study this, but instead of culturing such knowledge, people are attracted to temporary happiness and sense gratification, culminating in bottomless, topless passion. There is no profit in such activities; one must engage himself in the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement.</div>

<div class="Translation">[N&#257;rada Muni had spoken of a swan. That swan is explained in this verse.] The Vedic literatures [&#347;&#257;stras] vividly describe how to understand the Supreme Lord, the source of all material and spiritual energy. Indeed, they elaborately explain these two energies. The swan [ha&#7745;sa] is one who discriminates between matter and spirit, who accepts the essence of everything, and who explains the means of bondage and the means of liberation. The words of scriptures consist of variegated vibrations. If a foolish rascal leaves aside the study of these &#347;&#257;stras to engage in temporary activities, what will be the result?</div>

<div class="First">The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is very eager to present Vedic literature in modern languages, especially Western languages such as English, French and German. The leaders of the Western world, the Americans and Europeans, have become the idols of modern civilization because the Western people are very sophisticated in temporary activities for the advancement of material civilization. A sane man, however, can see that all such grand activities, although perhaps very important for temporary life, have nothing to do with eternal life. The entire world is imitating the materialistic civilization of the West, and therefore the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is very much interested in giving the Western people knowledge by translating the original Sanskrit Vedic literatures into Western languages.</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">vivikta-padam</span> refers to the path of logical discourses concerning the aim of life. If one does not discuss that which is important in life, one is put into darkness and must struggle for existence. What, then, is the benefit of his advancement in knowledge? The people of the West are seeing their students becoming hippies, despite gorgeous arrangements for university education. The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, however, is trying to convert misguided, drug-addicted students to the service of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and engage them in the best welfare activities for human society.</div>

Living like an animal, not understanding the goal of life, one foolishly thinks that there is no eternity and that his life span of fifty, sixty, or, at the most, one hundred years, is everything. This is the greatest foolishness. Time is eternal, and in the material world one passes through different phases of his eternal life. Time is compared herein to a sharp razor. A razor is meant to shave the hair from one&rsquo;s face, but if not carefully handled, the razor will cause disaster. One is advised not to create a disaster by misusing his lifetime. One should be extremely careful to utilize the span of his life for spiritual realization, or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness.</div>

The Harya&#347;vas understood the meaning of this question.] One must accept the original instructions of the &#347;&#257;stra.

One takes his second birth by dint of having received instructions in the &#347;&#257;stra from a bona fide spiritual master. Therefore, &#347;&#257;stra, scripture, is the real father. All the &#347;&#257;stras instruct that one should end his material way of life. If one does not know the purpose of the father&rsquo;s orders, the &#347;&#257;stras, he is ignorant.

<div class="First"><span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index2982.html?g=5058">16.7</a>) says, <span class="Italic">prav&#7771;tti&#7745; ca niv&#7771;tti&#7745; ca jan&#257; na vidur &#257;sur&#257;&#7717;:</span> demons, who are less than human beings but are not called animals, do not know the meaning of <span class="Italic">prav&#7771;tti</span> and <span class="Italic">niv&#7771;tti,</span> work to be done and work not to be done. In the material world, every living entity has a desire to lord it over the material world as much as possible. This is called <span class="Italic">prav&#7771;tti-m&#257;rga.</span> All the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras,</span> however, advise <span class="Italic">niv&#7771;tti-m&#257;rga,</span> or release from the materialistic way of life. Apart from the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> of the Vedic civilization, which is the oldest of the world, other <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> agree on this point. For example, in the Buddhist <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> Lord Buddha advises that one achieve <span class="Italic">nirv&#257;&#7751;a</span> by giving up the materialistic way of life. In the Bible, which is also <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra,</span> one will find the same advice: one should cease materialistic life and return to the kingdom of God. In any <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra</span> one may examine, especially the Vedic <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra,</span> the same advice is given: one should give up his materialistic life and return to his original, spiritual life. &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya also propounds the same conclusion. <span class="Italic">Brahma satya&#7745; jagan mithy&#257;:</span> this material world or materialistic life is simply illusion, and therefore one should stop his illusory activities and come to the platform of Brahman.</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra</span> refers to the scriptures, particularly the Vedic books of knowledge. The <span class="Italic">Vedas&mdash;S&#257;ma, Yajur, &#7770;g</span> and <span class="Italic">Atharva</span>&mdash;and any other books deriving knowledge from these <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are considered Vedic literatures. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> is the essence of all Vedic knowledge, and therefore it is the scripture whose instructions should be especially accepted. In this essence of all <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras,</span> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a personally advises that one give up all other duties and surrender unto Him (<span class="Italic">sarva-dharm&#257;n parityajya m&#257;m eka&#7745; &#347;ara&#7751;a&#7745; vraja</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="index3a32.html?g=5997">18.66</a>]).</div>
<div class="Purport">One should be initiated into following the principles of <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra.</span> In offering initiation, our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement asks one to come to the conclusion of <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra</span> by taking the advice of the supreme speaker of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra,</span> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, forgetting the principles of the materialistic way of life. Therefore the principles we advise are no illicit sex, no intoxication, no gambling and no meat-eating. These four types of engagement will enable an intelligent person to get free from the materialistic life and return home, back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purport">In regard to the instructions of the father and mother, it may be said that every living entity, including even the insignificant cats, dogs and serpents, takes birth of a father and mother. Therefore, getting a material father and mother is not a problem. In every form of life, birth after birth, the living entity gets a father and mother. In human society, however, if one is satisfied with his material father and mother and their instructions and does not make further progress by accepting a spiritual master and being educated in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras,</span> he certainly remains in darkness. The material father and mother are important only if they are interested in educating their son to become free from the clutches of death. As instructed by &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="index65b1.html?g=42877">5.5.18</a>): <span class="Italic">pit&#257; na sa sy&#257;j janan&#299; na s&#257; sy&#257;t/ na mocayed ya&#7717; samupeta-m&#7771;tyum.</span> One should not strive to become a mother or father if one cannot save one&rsquo;s dependent son from the impending danger of death. A parent who does not know how to save his son has no value because such fathers and mothers may be had in any form of life, even among the cats, dogs and so on. Only a father and mother who can elevate their son to the spiritual platform are bona fide parents. Therefore according to the Vedic system it is said, <span class="Italic">janman&#257; j&#257;yate &#347;&#363;dra&#7717;:</span> one is born of a material father and mother as a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra.</span> The purpose of life, however, is to become a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> a first-class man.</div>
<div class="Purport">A first-class intelligent man is called a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> because he knows the Supreme Brahman, the Absolute Truth.

<div class="Purport">The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is teaching this higher knowledge of retiring from materialistic life to return to Godhead, but unfortunately many parents are not very satisfied with this movement. Aside from the parents of our students, many businessmen are also dissatisfied because we teach our students to abandon intoxication, meat-eating, illicit sex and gambling. If the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement spreads, the so-called businessmen will have to close their slaughterhouses, breweries and cigarette factories. Therefore they are also very much afraid. However, we have no alternative than to teach our disciples to free themselves from materialistic life. We must instruct them in the opposite of material life to save them from the repetition of birth and death.</div>
<div class="Purport">N&#257;rada Muni, therefore, advised the Harya&#347;vas, the sons of Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a, that instead of begetting progeny, it would be better to leave and achieve the perfection of spiritual understanding according to the instructions of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras.</span> The importance of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> is mentioned in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index3512.html?g=5186">16.23</a>):</div>

This would have been unnecessarily entangling. The Harya&#347;vas did not consider pious and impious activities. Their materialistic father had instructed them to increase the population, but because of the words of N&#257;rada Muni, they could not heed that instruction. N&#257;rada Muni, as their spiritual master, gave them the &#347;&#257;stric instructions that they should give up this material world, and as bona fide disciples they followed his instructions.

<div class="After-Verse">The purport of this song is that N&#257;rada Muni, the great soul, plays a stringed instrument called a <span class="Italic">v&#299;&#7751;&#257;,</span> vibrating the sound <span class="Italic">r&#257;dhik&#257;-rama&#7751;a,</span> which is another name for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. As soon as he strokes the strings, all the devotees begin responding, making a very beautiful vibration. Accompanied by the stringed instrument, the singing seems like a shower of nectar, and all the devotees dance in ecstasy to the fullest extent of their satisfaction. While dancing, they appear madly intoxicated with ecstasy, as if drinking the beverage called <span class="Italic">m&#257;dhur&#299;-p&#363;ra.</span> Some of them cry, some of them dance, and some of them, although unable to dance publicly, dance within their hearts. Lord &#346;iva embraces N&#257;rada Muni and begins talking in an ecstatic voice, and seeing Lord &#346;iva dancing with N&#257;rada, Lord Brahm&#257; also joins, saying, &ldquo;All of you kindly chant &lsquo;Hari bol! Hari bol!&rsquo; &rdquo; The King of heaven, Indra, also gradually joins with great satisfaction and begins dancing and chanting &ldquo;Hari bol! Hari bol!&rdquo; In this way, by the influence of the transcendental vibration of the holy name of God, the whole universe becomes ecstatic. Bhaktivinoda &#7788;h&#257;kura says, &ldquo;When the universe becomes ecstatic, my desire is satisfied. I therefore pray unto the lotus feet of R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; that this chanting of <span class="Italic">harer n&#257;ma</span></I> [Adi </I><a href="indexd751.html?g=93741">17.21</a></I>]</I> may go on nicely like this.&rdquo;</div>

<div class="Translation">The Harya&#347;vas, the sons of Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a, were very well behaved, cultured sons, but unfortunately, because of the instructions of N&#257;rada Muni, they deviated from the order of their father. When Dak&#7779;a heard this news, which was brought to him by N&#257;rada Muni, he began to lament. Although he was the father of such good sons, he had lost them all. Certainly this was lamentable.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Harya&#347;vas, the sons of Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a, were certainly well behaved, learned and advanced, and in accordance with the order of their father they went to perform austerities to beget good sons for their family. But N&#257;rada Muni took advantage of their good behavior and culture to properly direct them not to be involved with this material world, but to use their culture and knowledge to end their material affairs. The Harya&#347;vas abided by the order of N&#257;rada Muni, but when news of this was brought to Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a, the <span class="Italic">praj&#257;pati,</span> instead of being happy with the actions of N&#257;rada Muni, was extremely sorrowful. Similarly, we are trying to bring as many young men as possible to the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement for their ultimate benefit, but the parents of the young men joining this movement, being very sorry, are lamenting and making counterpropaganda. Of course, Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a did not make propaganda against N&#257;rada Muni, but later, as we shall see, Dak&#7779;a cursed N&#257;rada Muni for his benevolent activities. This is the way of materialistic life. A materialistic father and mother want to engage their sons in begetting children, striving for improved economic conditions and rotting in materialistic life. They are not unhappy when their children become spoiled, useless citizens, but they lament when they join the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement to achieve the ultimate goal of life. This animosity between parents and the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement has existed since time immemorial. Even N&#257;rada Muni was condemned, not to speak of others. Nevertheless, N&#257;rada Muni never gives up his mission. To deliver as many fallen souls as possible, he continues playing his musical instrument and vibrating the transcendental sound Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare Hare/ Hare R&#257;ma, Hare R&#257;ma, R&#257;ma R&#257;ma, Hare Hare.</div>

As a dutiful father, he did not hesitate to allow his sons to receive cultural instructions concerning the perfection of life; he depended upon them to choose whether to return home, back to Godhead, or to rot in this material world in various species of life. In all circumstances, the duty of the father is to give cultural education to his sons, who must later decide which way to go. Responsible fathers should not hinder their sons who are making cultural advancement in association with the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement. This is not a father&rsquo;s duty.

<div class="First">From these verses it is apparent that the chanting of the <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra</span> or the Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras</span> must be accompanied by severe austerities. In Kali-yuga, people cannot undergo severe austerities like those mentioned herein&mdash;drinking only water and eating only air for many months. One cannot imitate such a process. But at least one must undergo some austerity by giving up four unwanted principles, namely illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. Anyone can easily practice this <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> and then the chanting of the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra</span> will be effective without delay. One should not give up the process of austerity. If possible, one should bathe in the waters of the Ganges or Yamun&#257;, or in the absence of the Ganges and Yamun&#257; one may bathe in the water of the sea. This is an item of austerity. Our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement has therefore established two very large centers, one in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana and another in M&#257;y&#257;pur, Navadv&#299;pa. There one may bathe in the Ganges or Yamun&#257;, chant the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra</span> and thus become perfect and return home, back to Godhead.</div>

N&#257;rada Muni, however, taking advantage of their highly elevated position in austerity, instructed them to become Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas in the renounced order. This is the duty of N&#257;rada Muni and his followers. They must show everyone the path of renouncing this material world and returning home, back to Godhead.

Although a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> may sometimes accept charity, it is not for his personal maintenance but for the worship of the Deity.

<div class="Purport">Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a condemned N&#257;rada Muni because N&#257;rada, a <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> who could beg from door to door, had made <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s</span> of Dak&#7779;a&rsquo;s sons, who were being trained to be <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hasthas.</span> Dak&#7779;a was extremely angry at N&#257;rada because he thought that N&#257;rada had done him a great injustice. According to Dak&#7779;a&rsquo;s opinion, N&#257;rada Muni had misled Dak&#7779;a&rsquo;s inexperienced sons (<span class="Italic">as&#257;dhv ak&#257;ry arbhak&#257;&#7751;&#257;m</span>). Dak&#7779;a regarded his sons as innocent boys who had been misled when N&#257;rada showed them the renounced order of life. Because of all these considerations, Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a charged that N&#257;rada Muni was <span class="Italic">as&#257;dhu</span> and should not have adopted the dress of a <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhu.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">Sometimes a saintly person is misunderstood by <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hasthas,</span> especially when he instructs their young sons to accept K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. Generally a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> thinks that unless one enters <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> life he cannot properly enter the renounced order. If a young man immediately adopts the path of the renounced order in accordance with the instructions of N&#257;rada or a member of his disciplic succession, his parents become very angry. This same phenomenon is occurring in our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement because we are instructing all the young boys in the Western countries to follow the path of renunciation. We allow <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> life, but a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> also follows the path of renunciation. Even a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> has to give up so many bad habits that his parents think his life has been practically destroyed. We allow no meat-eating, no illicit sex, no gambling and no intoxication, and consequently the parents wonder how, if there are so many no&rsquo;s, one&rsquo;s life can be positive. In the Western countries especially, these four prohibited activities practically constitute the life and soul of the modern population. Therefore parents sometimes dislike our movement, just as Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a disliked the activities of N&#257;rada and accused N&#257;rada of dishonesty. Nevertheless, although parents may be angry at us, we must perform our duty without hesitation because we are in the disciplic succession from N&#257;rada Muni.</div>
<div class="Purport">People addicted to householder life wonder how one can give up the enjoyment of <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> life, which is a concession for sex enjoyment, simply to become a mendicant in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. They do not know that the householder&rsquo;s concession for sex life cannot be regulated unless one accepts the life of a mendicant. The Vedic civilization therefore enjoins that at the end of one&rsquo;s fiftieth year one must give up household life. This is compulsory. However, because modern civilization is misled, householders want to remain in family life until death, and therefore they are suffering. In such cases, the disciples of N&#257;rada Muni advise all the members of the younger generation to join the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement immediately. There is nothing wrong in this.</div>

<div class="Translation">Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a said: My sons were not at all freed from their three debts. Indeed, they did not properly consider their obligations. O N&#257;rada Muni, O personality of sinful action, you have obstructed their progress toward good fortune in this world and the next because they are still indebted to the saintly persons, the demigods and their father.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">As soon as a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> takes birth, he assumes three kinds of debts&mdash;debts to great saints, debts to the demigods and debts to his father. The son of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> must undergo celibacy (<span class="Italic">brahmacarya</span>) to clear his debts to the saintly persons, he must perform ritualistic ceremonies to clear his debts to the demigods, and he must beget children to become free from his debts to his father. Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a argued that although the renounced order is recommended for liberation, one cannot attain liberation unless one fulfills his obligations to the demigods, the saints and his father. Since Dak&#7779;a&rsquo;s sons had not liberated themselves from these three debts, how could N&#257;rada Muni have led them to the renounced order of life? Apparently, Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a did not know the final decision of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras.</span> As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (11.5.41):</div>

Unfortunately, Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a, the father of the Harya&#347;vas and Saval&#257;&#347;vas, did not understand the great service rendered by N&#257;rada Muni. Dak&#7779;a therefore addressed him as <span class="Italic">p&#257;pa</span> (the personality of sinful activities) and <span class="Italic">as&#257;dhu</span> (a nonsaintly person). Since N&#257;rada Muni was a great saint and Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, he tolerated all such accusations from Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This mentality of Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a still continues even today. When young boys join the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, their fathers and so-called guardians are very angry at the propounder of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement because they think that their sons have been unnecessarily induced to deprive themselves of the material enjoyments of eating, drinking and merrymaking. <span class="Italic">Karm&#299;s,</span> fruitive workers, think that one should fully enjoy his present life in this material world and also perform some pious activities to be promoted to higher planetary systems for further enjoyment in the next life. A <span class="Italic">yog&#299;,</span> however, especially a <span class="Italic">bhakti-yog&#299;,</span> is callous to the opinions of this material world. He is not interested in traveling to the higher planetary systems of the demigods to enjoy a long life in an advanced materialistic civilization.

A pure devotee is not interested in yogic perfection, travel to higher planetary systems, or oneness with Brahman. He is interested only in rendering service to the Personality of Godhead. Since Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a was a <span class="Italic">karm&#299;,</span> he could not appreciate the great service N&#257;rada Muni had rendered his eleven thousand sons. Instead, he accused N&#257;rada Muni of being sinful and charged that because N&#257;rada Muni was associated with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord would also be defamed. Thus Dak&#7779;a criticized that N&#257;rada Muni was an offender to the Lord although he was known as an associate of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Such are the criticisms that must be borne by the servants of N&#257;rada Muni in the disciplic succession. Through the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, we are trying to train young people to become devotees and return home, back to Godhead, by following rigid regulative principles, but our service is appreciated neither in India nor abroad in the Western countries where we are endeavoring to spread this K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement. In India the caste <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> have become enemies of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement because we elevate foreigners, who are supposed to be <span class="Italic">mlecchas</span> and <span class="Italic">yavanas,</span> to the position of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> We train them in austerities and penances and recognize them as <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> by awarding them sacred threads. Thus the caste <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> of India are very displeased by our activities in the Western world. In the West also, the parents of the young people who join this movement have also become enemies. We have no business creating enemies, but the process is such that nondevotees will always be inimical toward us. Nevertheless, as stated in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras,</span> a devotee should be both tolerant and merciful. Devotees engaged in preaching should be prepared to be accused by ignorant persons, and yet they must be very merciful to the fallen conditioned souls. If one can execute his duty in the disciplic succession of N&#257;rada Muni, his service will surely be recognized. As the Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index2d38.html?g=6015">18.68</a>&ndash;69):</div>

<div class="Purport">In this verse the word <span class="Italic">sauh&#7771;da-ghnam</span> (&ldquo;a breaker of friendship&rdquo;) is used.

Actually such devotees are friends of every living entity (<span class="Italic">suh&#7771;da&#7745; sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;n&#257;m</span>), but they are misunderstood to be enemies.

Then, if she is intelligent, she will not want to be pregnant again. Actually. however. this is not a fact. Sex enjoyment is so strong that a woman becomes pregnant and suffers at the time of childbirth. but she becomes pregnant again, despite her experience. According to Dak&#7779;a&rsquo;s philosophy. one should become implicated in material enjoyment so that after experiencing the distress of such enjoyment. one will automatically renounce. Material nature, however. is so strong that although a man suffers at every step, he will not cease his attempts to enjoy (<span class="Italic">t&#7771;pyanti neha k&#7771;pa&#7751;a-bahu-du&#7717;kha-bh&#257;ja&#7717;</span>). Under the circumstances, unless one gets the association of a devotee like N&#257;rada Muni or his servant in the disciplic succession, one&rsquo;s dormant spirit of renunciation cannot be awakened. It is not a fact that because material enjoyment involves so many painful conditions one will automatically become detached. One needs the blessings of a devotee like N&#257;rada Muni. Then one can renounce his attachment for the material world. The young boys and girls of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement have given up the spirit of material enjoyment not because of practice but by the mercy of Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu and His servants.</div>

He was aggrieved, however, because N&#257;rada Muni had misled his sons for a second time. Therefore he wanted to prove that N&#257;rada Muni, although dressed like a <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhu,</span> was not actually a <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhu;</span> he himself, although a householder, was a greater <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhu</span> than N&#257;rada Muni.</div>

A preacher is known as <span class="Italic">parivr&#257;jak&#257;c&#257;rya</span>&mdash;an <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya,</span> or teacher, who always travels for the benefit of human society.

In the <span class="Italic">parampar&#257;</span> system from N&#257;rada Muni, I have also been cursed. Although I have many centers that would be suitable places of residence, I cannot stay anywhere, for I have been cursed by the parents of my young disciples.

</div><A NAME="78647"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;One should chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking oneself lower than the straw in the street; one should be more tolerant than a tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige and should be ready to offer all respects to others. In such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the Lord constantly.&rdquo; Following the orders of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, one who preaches the glories of the Lord all over the world or all over the universe should be humbler than grass and more tolerant than a tree because a preacher cannot live an easygoing life. Indeed, a preacher must face many impediments. Not only is he sometimes cursed, but sometimes he must also suffer personal injury. For example, when Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu went to preach K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness to the two roguish brothers Jag&#257;i and M&#257;dh&#257;i, they injured Him and made His head bleed, but nevertheless, He tolerantly delivered the two rogues, who became perfect Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas. This is the duty of a preacher. Lord Jesus Christ even tolerated crucifixion. Therefore the curse against N&#257;rada was not very astonishing, and he tolerated it.</div>
<div class="Purport">Now, it may be asked why N&#257;rada Muni stayed in the presence of Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a and tolerated all his accusations and curses. Was that for Dak&#7779;a&rsquo;s deliverance? The answer is yes. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura says that after being insulted by Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a, N&#257;rada Muni should have left immediately, but he purposely stayed to hear all Dak&#7779;a&rsquo;s strong words so that Dak&#7779;a might be relieved of his anger. Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a was not an ordinary man; he had accumulated the results of many pious activities. Therefore N&#257;rada Muni expected that after delivering his curse, Dak&#7779;a, satisfied and freed from anger, would repent his misbehavior and thus get a chance to become a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava and be delivered. When Jag&#257;i and M&#257;dh&#257;i offended Lord Nity&#257;nanda, Lord Nity&#257;nanda stood tolerantly, and therefore both brothers fell at His lotus feet and repented. Consequently they later became perfect Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas.</div>

Indra, being too absorbed in material opulence, forgot himself and did not respect B&#7771;haspati, who thus became aware of Indra&rsquo;s pride in his material opulence and immediately disappeared from the assembly to teach him a lesson. Indra became most repentant, understanding that because of his opulence he had forgotten to respect his spiritual master.

All of them were offering Indra their respects and services, and the Apsar&#257;s and Gandharvas were dancing and singing with very sweet musical instruments. Over Indra&rsquo;s head was a white umbrella as effulgent as the full moon. Fanned by yak-tail whisks and served with all the paraphernalia of a great king, Indra was sitting with his wife, &#346;ac&#299;dev&#299;, who occupied half the throne, when the great sage B&#7771;haspati appeared in that assembly. B&#7771;haspati, the best of the sages, was the spiritual master of Indra and the demigods and was respected by the demigods and demons alike. Nevertheless, although Indra saw his spiritual master before him, he did not rise from his own seat or offer a seat to his spiritual master, nor did Indra offer him a respectful welcome. Indra did nothing to show him respect.</div>

All I want, life after life, is to be a faithful servant of Your Lordship.&rdquo; According to the laws of nature, when one is extremely opulent one becomes degraded, and this is true both individually and collectively. The demigods are situated in the mode of goodness, but sometimes even one who is situated in such an exalted position as King Indra, the king of all the demigods, falls down because of material opulence. We are now actually seeing this in America. The entire American nation has tried to advance in material opulence without striving to produce ideal human beings. The result is that Americans are now regretting the wholesale criminality of American society and are wondering how America has become so lawless and unmanageable. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="index2706.html?g=55424">7.5.31</a>), <span class="Italic">na te vidu&#7717; sv&#257;rtha-gati&#7745; hi vi&#7779;&#7751;um:</span> persons who are unenlightened do not know the aim of life, which is to return home, back to Godhead. Therefore, both individually and collectively, they try to enjoy so-called material comforts, and they become addicted to wine and women. The men produced in such a society are less than fourth class. They are the unwanted population known as <span class="Italic">var&#7751;a-sa&#7749;kara,</span> and as stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> an increase of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;a-sa&#7749;kara</span> population creates a hellish society. This is the society in which Americans now find themselves.</div>
<div class="Purport">Fortunately, however, the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a movement has come to America, and many fortunate young men are giving serious attention to this movement, which is creating ideal men of first-class character, men who completely refrain from meat-eating, illicit sex, intoxication and gambling. If the American people are serious about curbing the degraded criminal life of their nation, they must take to the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement and try to create the kind of human society advised in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">c&#257;tur-var&#7751;ya&#7745; may&#257; s&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;a&#7745; gu&#7751;a-karma-vibh&#257;ga&#347;a&#7717;</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexd112.html?g=1541">4.13</a>]). They must divide their society into first-class men, second-class men, third-class men and fourth-class men. Since they are now creating only men who are less than fourth class, how can they avoid the dangers of a criminal society? Long, long ago, Lord Indra regretted his disrespect to his spiritual master, B&#7771;haspati. Similarly, it is advised that the American people regret their mistaken advancement in civilization. They should take advice from the spiritual master, the representative of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. If they do so, they will be happy, and theirs will be an ideal nation to lead the entire world.</div>

<div class="First">&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura says in this regard that when a president or king is sitting on his throne, he does not need to show respect to everyone who comes within his assembly, but he must show respect to superiors like his spiritual master, <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas. There are many examples of how he should act. When Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was sitting on His throne and N&#257;rada fortunately entered His assembly, even Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a immediately stood up with His officers and ministers to offer respectful obeisances to N&#257;rada. N&#257;rada knew that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a knew that N&#257;rada was His devotee, but although K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the Supreme Lord and N&#257;rada is the Lord&rsquo;s devotee, the Lord observed the religious etiquette. Since N&#257;rada was a <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;,</span> a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> and an exalted devotee, even K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, while acting as a king, offered His respectful obeisances unto N&#257;rada. Such is the conduct visible in the Vedic civilization. A civilization in which the people do not know how the representative of N&#257;rada and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a should be respected, how society should be formed and how one should advance in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness&mdash;a society concerned only with manufacturing new cars and new skyscrapers every year and then breaking them to pieces and making new ones&mdash;may be technologically advanced, but it is not a human civilization. A human civilization is advanced when its people follow the <span class="Italic">c&#257;tur-var&#7751;ya</span> system, the system of four orders of life. There must be ideal, first-class men to act as advisors, second-class men to act as administrators, third-class men to produce food and protect cows, and fourth-class men who obey the three higher classes of society. One who does not follow the standard system of society should be considered a fifth-class man. A society without Vedic laws and regulations will not be very helpful to humanity. As stated in this verse, <span class="Italic">dharma&#7745; te na para&#7745; vidu&#7717;:</span> such a society does not know the aim of life and the highest principle of religion.</div>

<div class="Translation">Lord Brahm&#257; said: O best of the demigods, unfortunately, because of madness resulting from your material opulence, you failed to receive B&#7771;haspati properly when he came to your assembly. Because he is aware of the Supreme Brahman and fully in control of his senses, he is the best of the br&#257;hma&#7751;as. Therefore it is very astonishing that you have acted impudently toward him.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Lord Brahm&#257; recognized the brahminical qualifications of B&#7771;haspati, who was the spiritual master of the demigods because of his awareness of the Supreme Brahman. B&#7771;haspati was very much in control of his senses and mind, and therefore he was a most qualified <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> Lord Brahm&#257; chastised the demigods for not properly respecting this <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> who was their <span class="Italic">guru.</span> Lord Brahm&#257; wanted to impress upon the demigods that one&rsquo;s <span class="Italic">guru</span> should not be disrespected under any circumstances. When B&#7771;haspati entered the assembly of the demigods, they and their king, Indra, took him for granted. Since he came every day, they thought, they did not need to show him special respect. As it is said, familiarity breeds contempt. Being very much displeased, B&#7771;haspati immediately left Indra&rsquo;s palace. Thus all the demigods, headed by Indra, became offenders at the lotus feet of B&#7771;haspati, and Lord Brahm&#257;, being aware of this, condemned their neglect. In a song we sing every day, Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura says, <span class="Italic">cak&#7779;u-d&#257;na dila yei, janme janme prabhu sei:</span> the <span class="Italic">guru</span> gives spiritual insight to the disciple, and therefore the <span class="Italic">guru</span> should be considered his master, life after life. Under no circumstances should the <span class="Italic">guru</span> be disrespected, but the demigods, being puffed up by their material possessions, were disrespectful to their <span class="Italic">guru.</span> Therefore <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (11.17.27) advises, <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya&#7745; m&#257;&#7745; vij&#257;n&#299;y&#257;n n&#257;vamanyeta karhicit/ na martya-buddhy&#257;s&#363;yeta:</span> the <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya</span> should always be offered respectful obeisances; one should never envy the <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya,</span> considering him an ordinary human being.</div>

Not very many years ago, a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;anagara, near Navadv&#299;pa, was offered some help from the local Zamindar, Vraja K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;acandra. The <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> refused to accept the help. He said that since he was very happy in his householder life, taking rice given by his disciples and cooking vegetables of tamarind leaves, there was no question of taking help from the Zamindar. The conclusion is that although a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> may receive much opulence from his disciples, he should not utilize the rewards of his priesthood for his personal benefit; he must use them for the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation">The opulence of the demons, who are generally known as the enemies of the demigods, was protected by the talents and tactics of &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya, but Vi&#347;var&#363;pa, who was most powerful, composed a protective prayer known as the N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a-kavaca. By this intelligent mantra, he took away the opulence of the demons and gave it to Mahendra, the King of heaven.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The distinction between the demigods (<span class="Italic">devas</span>) and demons (<span class="Italic">asuras</span>) is that the demigods are all devotees of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u whereas the demons are devotees of demigods like Lord &#346;iva, Goddess K&#257;l&#299; and Goddess Durg&#257;. Sometimes the demons are also devotees of Lord Brahm&#257;. For example, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was a devotee of Lord Brahm&#257;, R&#257;va&#7751;a was a devotee of Lord &#346;iva, and Mahi&#7779;&#257;sura was a devotee of Goddess Durg&#257;. The demigods are devotees of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u (<span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-bhakta&#7717; sm&#7771;to daiva</span>), whereas the demons (<span class="Italic">&#257;suras tad-viparyaya&#7717;</span>) are always against the <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-bhaktas,</span> or Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas. To oppose the Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas, the demons become devotees of Lord &#346;iva, Lord Brahm&#257;, K&#257;l&#299;, Durg&#257;, and so on. In the days of yore, many long years ago, there was animosity between the <span class="Italic">devas</span> and the <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> and the same spirit still continues, for the devotees of Lord &#346;iva and Goddess Durg&#257; are always envious of Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas, who are devotees of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. This strain between the devotees of Lord &#346;iva and Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u has always existed. In the higher planetary systems, fights between the demons and the demigods continue for a long, long time.</div>
<div class="Purport">Herein we see that Vi&#347;var&#363;pa made for the demigods a protective covering, saturated with a Vi&#7779;&#7751;u <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> Sometimes the Vi&#7779;&#7751;u <span class="Italic">mantra</span> is called Vi&#7779;&#7751;u-jvara, and the &#346;iva <span class="Italic">mantra</span> is called &#346;iva-jvara. We find in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> that sometimes the &#346;iva-jvara and Vi&#7779;&#7751;u-jvara are employed in the fights between the demons and the demigods.</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">sura-dvi&#7779;&#257;m,</span> which in this verse means &ldquo;of the enemies of the demigods,&rdquo; also refers to the atheists. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> elsewhere says that Lord Buddha appeared for the purpose of bewildering the demons or atheists.

Unfortunately, because of Kali-yuga, foolish people do not surrender to the lotus feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Even most people who claim to belong to the Vedic system of religion are actually opposed to the Vedic principles. Every day they manufacture a new type of <span class="Italic">dharma</span> on the plea that whatever one manufactures is also a path of liberation. Atheistic men generally say, <span class="Italic">yata mata tata patha.</span> According to this view, there are hundreds and thousands of different opinions in human society, and each opinion is a valid religious principle. This philosophy of rascals has killed the religious principles mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> and such philosophies will become increasingly influential as Kali-yuga progresses. In the last stage of Kali-yuga, Kalkideva, the fierce incarnation of Ke&#347;ava, will descend to kill all the atheists and will save only the devotees of the Lord.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">As a fire, although existing in one place, can expand its light and heat everywhere, so the omnipotent Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although situated in His spiritual abode, expands Himself everywhere, in both the material and spiritual worlds, by His various energies. Since both cause and effect are the Supreme Lord, there is no difference between cause and effect. Consequently the ornaments and weapons of the Lord, being expansions of His spiritual energy, are not different from Him. There is no difference between the Lord and His variously presented energies. This is also confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Padma Pur&#257;&#7751;a:</span></div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">n&#257;ma cint&#257;ma&#7751;i&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&#347;<br>caitanya-rasa-vigraha&#7717;<br>p&#363;r&#7751;a&#7717; &#347;uddho nitya-mukto<br>&rsquo;bhinnatv&#257;n n&#257;ma-n&#257;mino&#7717;</div>
</div><A NAME="79988"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">The holy name of the Lord is fully identical with the Lord, not partially. The word <span class="Italic">p&#363;r&#7751;a</span> means &ldquo;complete.&rdquo; The Lord is omnipotent and omniscient, and similarly, His name, form, qualities, paraphernalia and everything pertaining to Him are complete, pure, eternal and free from material contamination. The prayer to the ornaments and carriers of the Lord is not false, for they are as good as the Lord. Since the Lord is all-pervasive, He exists in everything, and everything exists in Him. Therefore even worship of the Lord&rsquo;s weapons or ornaments has the same potency as worship of the Lord. M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s refuse to accept the form of the Lord, or they say that the form of the Lord is <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> or false, but one should note very carefully that this is not acceptable. Although the Lord&rsquo;s original form and His impersonal expansion are one, the Lord maintains His form, qualities and abode eternally. Therefore this prayer says, <span class="Italic">p&#257;tu sarvai&#7717; svar&#363;pair na&#7717; sad&#257; sarvatra sama-ga&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;May the Lord, who is all-pervasive in His various forms, protect us everywhere.&rdquo; The Lord is always present everywhere by His name, form, qualities, attributes and paraphernalia, and they all have equal power to protect the devotees. &#346;r&#299;la Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya explains this as follows:</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">After Vi&#347;var&#363;pa was killed, his father, Tva&#7779;&#7789;&#257;, performed a sacrifice to kill King Indra. Unfortunately, if <span class="Italic">mantras</span> are chanted irregularly, they yield an opposite result. This happened when Tva&#7779;&#7789;&#257; performed this <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a.</span> While performing the sacrifice to kill Indra. Tva&#7779;&#7789;&#257; chanted a <span class="Italic">mantra</span> to increase Indra&rsquo;s enemies, but because he chanted the <span class="Italic">mantra</span> wrong, the sacrifice produced an <span class="Italic">asura</span> named V&#7771;tr&#257;sura, of whom Indra was the enemy. When V&#7771;tr&#257;sura was generated from the sacrifice, his fierce features made the whole world afraid, and his personal effulgence diminished even the power of the demigods. Finding no other means of protection, the demigods began to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the enjoyer of all the results of sacrifice, who is supreme throughout the entire universe. The demigods all worshiped Him because ultimately no one but Him can protect a living entity from fear and danger. Seeking shelter of a demigod instead of worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead is compared to trying to cross the ocean by grasping the tail of a dog. A dog can swim, but that does not mean that one can cross the ocean by grasping a dog&rsquo;s tail.</div>

<div class="First">An inexperienced man generally does not know what to beg from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Everyone is under the jurisdiction of the created material world, and no one knows what benediction to ask when praying to the Supreme Lord. People generally pray to be promoted to the heavenly planets because they have no information of Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka. &#346;r&#299;la Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya quotes the following verse:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">deva-lok&#257;t pit&#7771;-lok&#257;t<br>niray&#257;c c&#257;pi yat param<br>tis&#7771;bhya&#7717; parama&#7745; sth&#257;na&#7745;<br>vai&#7779;&#7751;ava&#7745; vidu&#7779;&#257;&#7745; gati&#7717;</div>

<div class="After-Verse">There are different planetary systems, known as Devaloka (the planets of the demigods), Pit&#7771;loka (the planet of the Pit&#257;s) and Niraya (the hellish planets). When one transcends these various planetary systems and enters Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka, he achieves the ultimate resort of the Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas. Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas have nothing to do with the other planetary systems.</div>

<div class="Translation">O Supreme Personality of Godhead, O N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, O V&#257;sudeva, original person! O most exalted person, supreme experience, welfare personified! O supreme benediction, supremely merciful and changeless! O support of the cosmic manifestation, sole proprietor of all planetary systems, master of everything and husband of the goddess of fortune! Your Lordship is realized by the topmost sanny&#257;s&#299;s, who wander about the world to preach K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, fully absorbed in sam&#257;dhi through bhakti-yoga. Because their minds are concentrated upon You, they can receive the conception of Your personality in their fully purified hearts. When the darkness in their hearts is completely eradicated and You are revealed to them, the transcendental bliss they enjoy is the transcendental form of Your Lordship. No one but such persons can realize You. Therefore we simply offer You our respectful obeisances.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Supreme Personality of Godhead has numerous transcendental names pertaining to different grades of revelation to various grades of devotees and transcendentalists. When He is realized in His impersonal form He is called the Supreme Brahman, when realized as the Param&#257;tm&#257; He is called <span class="Italic">antary&#257;m&#299;,</span> and when He expands Himself in different forms for material creation He is called K&#7779;&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and K&#257;ra&#7751;odaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. When He is realized as V&#257;sudeva, Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a, Pradyumna and Aniruddha&mdash;the Caturvy&#363;ha, who are beyond the three forms of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&mdash;He is the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. Above realization of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a is realization of Baladeva, and above that is realization of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. All these realizations are possible when one engages fully in devotional service. The covered core of one&rsquo;s heart is then completely open to receiving an understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His various forms.</div>

<div class="Translation">O Lord, You need no support, and although You have no material body, You do not need cooperation from us. Since You are the cause of the cosmic manifestation and You supply its material ingredients without being transformed, You create, maintain and annihilate this cosmic manifestation by Yourself.

Consequently these transcendental activities of Yours are extremely difficult to understand.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The <span class="Ref_Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> (5.37) says, <span class="Italic">goloka eva nivasaty akhil&#257;tma-bh&#363;ta&#7717;:</span> the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, is always situated in Goloka V&#7771;nd&#257;vana. It is also said, <span class="Italic">v&#7771;nd&#257;vana&#7745; parityajya padam eka&#7745; na gacchati:</span> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a never goes even a step from V&#7771;nd&#257;vana. Nevertheless, although K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is situated in His own abode, Goloka V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, He is simultaneously all-pervading and is therefore present everywhere. This is very difficult for a conditioned soul to understand. but devotees can understand how K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, without undergoing any changes, can simultaneously be in His abode and be all-pervasive. The demigods are understood to be various limbs of the Supreme Lord&rsquo;s body, although the Supreme Lord has no material body and does not need anyone&rsquo;s help. He is spread everywhere (<span class="Italic">may&#257; tatam ida&#7745; sarva&#7745; jagad avyakta-m&#363;rtin&#257;</span>). Nevertheless, He is not present everywhere in His spiritual form. According to the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da philosophy, the Supreme Truth, being all-pervasive, does not need a transcendental form. The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s suppose that since His form is distributed everywhere, He has no form. This is untrue. The Lord keeps His transcendental form, and at the same time He extends everywhere, in every nook and corner of the material creation.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">These are our inquiries. The ordinary conditioned soul is subject to the material laws, and he thus receives the fruits of his actions. Does Your Lordship, like an ordinary human being, exist within this material world in a body produced by the material modes? Do You enjoy or suffer the good or bad results of actions under the influence of time, past work and so forth? Or, on the contrary, are You present here only as a neutral witness who is self-sufficient, free from all material desires, and always full of spiritual potency? We certainly cannot understand Your actual position.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says that He descends to this material world for two purposes, namely <span class="Italic">paritr&#257;&#7751;&#257;ya s&#257;dh&#363;n&#257;&#7745; vin&#257;&#347;&#257;ya ca du&#7779;k&#7771;t&#257;m</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexb53f.html?g=1496">4.8</a>]&mdash;to relieve the devotees and kill demons or nondevotees. These two kinds of action are the same for the Absolute Truth. When the Lord comes to punish the demons, He bestows His favor upon them, and similarly when He delivers His devotees and gives them relief, He also bestows His favor. Thus the Lord bestows His favor equally upon the conditioned souls. When a conditioned soul gives relief to others he acts piously, and when he gives trouble to others he acts impiously, but the Lord is neither pious nor impious; He is always full in His spiritual potency, by which He shows equal mercy to the punishable and the protectable. The Lord is <span class="Italic">ap&#257;pa-viddham;</span> He is never contaminated by the reactions of so-called sinful activities. When K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was present on this earth, He killed many inimical nondevotees, but they all received <span class="Italic">s&#257;r&#363;pya;</span> in other words, they returned to their original spiritual bodies. One who does not know the Lord&rsquo;s position says that God is unkind to him but merciful to others. Actually the Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index90b5.html?g=3246">9.29</a>), <span class="Italic">samo &rsquo;ha&#7745; sarva-bh&#363;te&#7779;u na me dve&#7779;yo &rsquo;sti na priya&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;I am equal to everyone. No one is My enemy, and no one is My friend.&rdquo; But He also says, <span class="Italic">ye bhajanti tu m&#257;&#7745; bhakty&#257; mayi te te&#7779;u c&#257;py aham:</span> &ldquo;If one becomes My devotee and fully surrenders unto Me, I give him special attention.&rdquo;</div>

<div class="Translation">O Supreme Personality of Godhead, all contradictions can be reconciled in You. O Lord, since You are the Supreme Person, the reservoir of unlimited spiritual qualities, the supreme controller, Your unlimited glories are inconceivable to the conditioned souls. Many modern theologians argue about right and wrong without knowing what is actually right. Their arguments are always false and their judgments inconclusive because they have no authorized evidence with which to gain knowledge of You. Because their minds are agitated by scriptures containing false conclusions, they are unable to understand the truth concerning You. Furthermore, because of polluted eagerness to arrive at the right conclusion, their theories are incapable of revealing You, who are transcendental to their material conceptions. You are one without a second, and therefore in You contradictions like doing and not doing, happiness and distress, are not contradictory. Your potency is so great that it can do and undo anything as You like. With the help of that potency, what is impossible for You? Since there is no duality in Your constitutional position, You can do everything by the influence of Your energy.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Supreme Personality of Godhead, being self-sufficient, is full of transcendental bliss (<span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;r&#257;ma</span>). He enjoys bliss in two ways&mdash;when He appears happy and when He appears distressed. Distinctions and contradictions are impossible in Him because only from Him have they emanated. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the reservoir of all knowledge, all potency, all strength, opulence and influence. There is no limit to His powers. Since He is full in all transcendental attributes, nothing abominable from the material world can exist in Him. He is transcendental and spiritual, and therefore conceptions of material happiness and distress do not apply to Him.</div>
<div class="Purport">We should not be astonished to find contradictions in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Actually there are no contradictions. That is the meaning of His being supreme. Because He is all-powerful, He is not subject to the conditioned soul&rsquo;s arguments regarding His existence or nonexistence. He is pleased to protect His devotees by killing their enemies. He enjoys both the killing and the protecting.</div>
<div class="Purport">Such freedom from duality applies not only to the Lord but also to His devotees. In V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, the damsels of Vrajabh&#363;mi enjoy transcendental bliss in the company of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and they feel the same transcendental bliss in separation when K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and Balar&#257;ma leave V&#7771;nd&#257;vana for Mathur&#257;. There is no question of material pains or pleasures for either the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His pure devotees, although they are sometimes superficially said to be distressed or happy. One who is <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;r&#257;ma</span> is blissful in both ways.</div>
<div class="Purport">Nondevotees cannot understand the contradictions present in the Supreme Lord or His devotees. Therefore in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the Lord says, <span class="Italic">bhakty&#257; m&#257;m abhij&#257;n&#257;ti:</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexbf7d.html?g=5898">18.55</a>] the transcendental pastimes can be understood through devotional service; to nondevotees they are inconceivable. <span class="Italic">Acinty&#257;&#7717; khalu ye bh&#257;v&#257; na t&#257;&#7745;s tarke&#7751;a yojayet:</span> the Supreme Lord and His form, name, pastimes and paraphernalia are inconceivable to nondevotees, and one should not try to understand such realities simply by logical arguments. They will not bring one to the right conclusion about the Absolute Truth.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">A rope causes fear for a bewildered person who considers it a snake, but not for a person with proper intelligence who knows it to be only a rope. Similarly, You, as the Supersoul in everyone&rsquo;s heart, inspire fear or fearlessness according to one&rsquo;s intelligence, but in You there is no duality.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index477f.html?g=1523">4.11</a>) the Lord says, <span class="Italic">ye yath&#257; m&#257;&#7745; prapadyante t&#257;&#7745;s tathaiva bhaj&#257;my aham:</span> &ldquo;As one surrenders unto Me, I reward him accordingly.&rdquo; The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the reservoir of everything, including all knowledge, all truth and all contradictions. The example cited herein is very appropriate. A rope is one truth, but some mistake it for a snake, whereas others know it to be a rope. Similarly, devotees who know the Supreme Personality of Godhead do not see contradictions in Him, but nondevotees regard Him as the snakelike source of all fear. For example, when N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva appeared, Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja saw the Lord as the supreme solace, whereas his father, a demon, saw Him as the ultimate death. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (11.2.37), <span class="Italic">bhaya&#7745; dvit&#299;y&#257;bhinive&#347;ata&#7717; sy&#257;t:</span> fear results from being absorbed in duality. When one is in knowledge of duality, one knows both fear and bliss. The same Supreme Lord is a source of bliss to devotees and fear to nondevotees who have a poor fund of knowledge. God is one, but people understand the Absolute Truth from different angles of vision. The unintelligent see contradictions in Him, but sober devotees find no contradictions.</div>

Assuming such various forms, You have always punished the demons and D&#257;navas.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">There are two kinds of devotees, known as <span class="Italic">sak&#257;ma</span> and <span class="Italic">ak&#257;ma.</span> Pure devotees are <span class="Italic">ak&#257;ma,</span> whereas devotees in the upper planetary systems, such as the demigods, are called <span class="Italic">sak&#257;ma</span> because they still want to enjoy material opulence. Because of their pious activities, the <span class="Italic">sak&#257;ma</span> devotees are promoted to the higher planetary systems, but at heart they still desire to lord it over the material resources. The <span class="Italic">sak&#257;ma</span> devotees are sometimes disturbed by the demons and R&#257;k&#7779;asas, but the Lord is so kind that He always saves them by appearing as an incarnation. The Lord&rsquo;s incarnations are so powerful that Lord V&#257;manadeva covered the entire universe with two steps and therefore had no place for His third step. The Lord is called Trivikrama because He showed His strength by delivering the entire universe with merely three steps.</div>
<div class="Purport">The difference between <span class="Italic">sak&#257;ma</span> and <span class="Italic">ak&#257;ma</span> devotees is that when <span class="Italic">sak&#257;ma</span> devotees, like the demigods, fall into difficulty, they approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead for relief, whereas <span class="Italic">ak&#257;ma</span> devotees, even in the greatest danger, never disturb the Lord for material benefits. Even if an <span class="Italic">ak&#257;ma</span> devotee is suffering, he thinks this is due to his past impious activities and agrees to suffer the consequences. He never disturbs the Lord. <span class="Italic">Sak&#257;ma</span> devotees immediately pray to the Lord as soon as they are in difficulty, but they are regarded as pious because they consider themselves fully dependent on the mercy of the Lord. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (10.14.8):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">tat te &rsquo;nukamp&#257;&#7745; susam&#299;k&#7779;am&#257;&#7751;o<br>bhu&ntilde;j&#257;na ev&#257;tma-k&#7771;ta&#7745; vip&#257;kam<br>h&#7771;d-v&#257;g-vapurbhir vidadhan namas te<br>j&#299;veta yo mukti-pade sa d&#257;ya-bh&#257;k</div>

<div class="After-Verse">Even while suffering in the midst of difficulties, devotees simply offer their prayers and service more enthusiastically. In this way they become firmly fixed in devotional service and eligible to return home, back to Godhead, without a doubt. <span class="Italic">Sak&#257;ma</span> devotees, of course, achieve from the Lord the results they desire from their prayers, but they do not immediately become fit to return to Godhead. It is to be noted herein that Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, in His various incarnations, is always the protector of His devotees. &#346;r&#299;la Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya says: <span class="Italic">vividha&#7745; bh&#257;va-p&#257;tratv&#257;t sarve vi&#7779;&#7751;or vibh&#363;taya&#7717;.</span> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the original Personality of Godhead (<span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;as tu bhagav&#257;n svayam</span>).

You are the complete whole. Therefore, of what do we need to inform You? You know everything because You are the original cause of the cosmic manifestation, the maintainer and the annihilator of the entire universal creation. You always engage in Your pastimes with Your spiritual and material energies, for You are the controller of all these varied energies. You exist within all living entities, within the cosmic manifestation, and also beyond them. You exist internally as Parabrahman and externally as the ingredients of the material creation. Therefore, although manifested in various stages, at different times and places, and in various bodies, You, the Personality of Godhead, are the original cause of all causes. Indeed, You are the original element. You are the witness of all activities, but because You are as great as the sky, You are never touched by any of them. You are the witness of everything as Parabrahman and Param&#257;tm&#257;. O Supreme Personality of Godhead, nothing is unknown to You.</div>

Bhagav&#257;n, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the cause of Brahman and Param&#257;tm&#257;. Brahman, the impersonal Absolute Truth, is all-pervading, and Param&#257;tm&#257; is locally situated in everyone&rsquo;s heart, but Bhagav&#257;n, who is worshipable by the devotees. is the original cause of all causes. A pure devotee is aware that since nothing is unknown to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He need not be informed of a devotee&rsquo;s conveniences and inconveniences. A pure devotee knows that there is no need to ask the Absolute Truth for any material necessities. Therefore, while informing the Supreme Lord about their distress in being attacked by V&#7771;tr&#257;sura, the demigods apologized for offering prayers for their safety. A neophyte devotee, of course, approaches the Supreme Lord for relief from distress or poverty, or for speculative knowledge of the Lord. <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index3bf4.html?g=2604">7.16</a>) mentions four kinds of pious men who begin devotional service to the Lord&mdash;one who is distressed (<span class="Italic">&#257;rta</span>), one in need of money (<span class="Italic">arth&#257;rth&#299;</span>), one who is inquisitive (<span class="Italic">jij&ntilde;&#257;su</span>) and one who is searching for the Absolute Truth (<span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;</span>). A pure devotee, however, knows that since the Lord is omnipresent and omniscient, there is no need to offer prayers or worship Him for one&rsquo;s personal benefit. A pure devotee always engages in the service of the Lord without demanding anything. The Lord is present everywhere and knows the necessities of His devotees; consequently there is no need to disturb Him by asking Him for material benefits.</div>

All requests for benedictions from the demigods, however, are due to material lust. The benedictions will be finished at the end of the cosmic manifestation, along with those who bestow them. If one approaches Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u for benedictions, the Lord will give him a benediction that will help him return home, back to Godhead.

<div class="Translation">If one is unhappy to see the distress of other living beings and happy to see their happiness, his religious principles are appreciated as imperishable by exalted persons who are considered pious and benevolent.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">One generally follows different types of religious principles or performs various occupational duties according to the body given to him by the modes of material nature. In this verse, however, real religious principles are explained. Everyone should be unhappy to see others in distress and happy to see others happy. <span class="Italic">&#256;tmavat sarva-bh&#363;te&#7779;u:</span> one should feel the happiness and distress of others as his own. It is on this basis that the Buddhist religious principle of nonviolence&mdash;<span class="Italic">ahi&#7745;sa&#7717; parama-dharma&#7717;</span>&mdash;is established. We feel pain when someone disturbs us, and therefore we should not inflict pain upon other living beings. Lord Buddha&rsquo;s mission was to stop unnecessary animal killing, and therefore he preached that the greatest religious principle is nonviolence.</div>
<div class="Purport">One cannot continue killing animals and at the same time be a religious man. That is the greatest hypocrisy. Jesus Christ said, &ldquo;Do not kill,&rdquo; but hypocrites nevertheless maintain thousands of slaughterhouses while posing as Christians. Such hypocrisy is condemned in this verse. One should be happy to see others happy, and one should be unhappy to see others unhappy. This is the principle to be followed. Unfortunately, at the present moment so-called philanthropists and humanitarians advocate the happiness of humanity at the cost of the lives of poor animals. That is not recommended herein. This verse clearly says that one should be compassionate to all living entities. Regardless of whether human. animal, tree or plant, all living entities are sons of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexf156.html?g=4632">14.4</a>):</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;It should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kunt&#299;, are made possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father.&rdquo; The different forms of these living entities are only their external dresses.

He placed himself, the spirit soul, at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and in this way gave up his gross material body made of five elements.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">As indicated by the words <span class="Italic">pare bhagavati brahma&#7751;y &#257;tm&#257;na&#7745; sannayan,</span> Dadh&#299;ci placed himself, as spirit soul, at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this regard, one may refer to the incident of Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra&rsquo;s leaving his body, as described in the First Canto of <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="index6bad.html?g=10936">1.13.55</a>). Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra analytically divided his gross material body into the five different elements of which it was made&mdash;earth, water, fire, air and ether&mdash;and distributed them to the different reservoirs of these elements; in other words, he merged these five elements into the original <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva.</span> By identifying his material conception of life, he gradually separated his spirit soul from material connections and placed himself at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The example given in this connection is that when an earthen pot is broken, the small portion of the sky within the pot is united with the large sky outside the pot. M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers misunderstand this description of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> Therefore &#346;r&#299; R&#257;m&#257;nuja Sv&#257;m&#299;, in his book <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-tattva-s&#257;ra,</span> has described that this merging of the soul means that after separating himself from the material body made of eight elements&mdash;earth, water, fire, air, ether, false ego, mind and intelligence&mdash;the individual soul engages himself in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His eternal form (<span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;vara&#7717; parama&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&#7717; sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha&#7717;/ an&#257;dir &#257;dir govinda&#7717; sarva-k&#257;ra&#7751;a-k&#257;ra&#7751;am </I>[</I>Bs. </span>5.1</I>]</I>). The material cause of the material elements absorbs the material body, and the spiritual soul assumes its original position. As described by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, <span class="Italic">j&#299;vera &lsquo;svar&#363;pa&rsquo; haya&mdash;k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;era &lsquo;nitya-d&#257;sa&rsquo;: </I>[</span></I>Cc. <span class="Ref_Italic">Madhya</span> <a href="indexf61a.html?g=125576">20.108</a>] the constitutional position of the living entity is that he is the eternal servant of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. When one overcomes the material body through cultivation of spiritual knowledge and devotional service, one can revive his own position and thus engage in the service of the Lord.</div>

Speaking very bravely, he stood alone to face the demigods. When the demigods saw V&#7771;tr&#257;sura&rsquo;s attitude, they were so afraid that they practically fainted, and V&#7771;tr&#257;sura began trampling them down. Unable to tolerate this, Indra, the King of the demigods, threw his club at V&#7771;tr&#257;sura, but V&#7771;tr&#257;sura was such a great hero that he easily caught the club with his left hand and used it to beat Indra&rsquo;s elephant.

Such a person has nothing for which to aspire in the three worlds. The Supreme Lord is so kind that He especially favors such a devotee by not giving him opulence that will hamper his devotional service. Therefore I wish to give up everything for the service of the Lord. I wish always to chant the glories of the Lord and engage in His service. Let me become unattached to my worldly family and make friendships with the devotees of the Lord.

<div class="First">V&#7771;tr&#257;sura rebuked both the demigods and the demoniac soldiers because the demons were running in fear of their lives and the demigods were killing them from behind. The actions of both were abominable. When a fight takes place, the opposing parties must be prepared to fight like heroes. A hero never runs from the field of battle. He always fights face to face, determined to gain victory or lay down his life in the fight. That is heroic. Killing an enemy from behind is also inglorious. When an enemy turns his back and runs in fear of his life, he should not be killed. This is the etiquette of military science.</div>
<div class="Purport">V&#7771;tr&#257;sura insulted the demoniac soldiers by comparing them to the stool of their mothers. Both stool and a cowardly son come from the abdomen of the mother, and V&#7771;tr&#257;sura said that there is no difference between them. A similar comparison was given by Tulas&#299; d&#257;sa, who commented that a son and urine both come from the same channel. In other words, semen and urine both come from the genitals, but semen produces a child whereas urine produces nothing. Therefore if a child is neither a hero nor a devotee, he is not a son but urine. Similarly, C&#257;&#7751;akya Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita also says:</div>

Therefore even though Indra stood with the thunderbolt to hurl against V&#7771;tr&#257;sura, he was doubtful, thinking that the thunderbolt might also fail. V&#7771;tr&#257;sura, however, being a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, assured Indra that the thunderbolt would not fail, for V&#7771;tr&#257;sura knew that it had been prepared in accordance with the instructions of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Although Indra had doubts because he could not understand that Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&rsquo;s order never fails, V&#7771;tr&#257;sura understood Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&rsquo;s purpose. V&#7771;tr&#257;sura was eager to be killed by the thunderbolt manufactured according to Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&rsquo;s instructions because he was sure that he would thus return home, back to Godhead.

<div class="First">There are four objectives in human life&mdash;namely, religiosity (<span class="Italic">dharma</span>), economic development (<span class="Italic">artha</span>), sense gratification (<span class="Italic">k&#257;ma</span>), and liberation (<span class="Italic">mok&#7779;a</span>) from the bondage of material existence. People generally aspire for religiosity, economic development and sense gratification, but a devotee has no other desire than to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead both in this life and in the next. The special mercy for the unalloyed devotee is that the Lord saves him from hard labor to achieve the results of religion, economic development and sense gratification. Of course, if one wants such benefits, the Lord certainly awards them. Indra, for example, although a devotee, was not much interested in release from material bondage; instead, he desired sense gratification and a high standard of material happiness in the heavenly planets. V&#7771;tr&#257;sura, however, being an unalloyed devotee, aspired only to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This verse gives the sum and substance of devotional life. One must first become a servant of the servant of the servant of the Lord (<span class="Italic">d&#257;s&#257;nud&#257;sa</span>). &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu advised, and He also showed by His own example, that a living entity should always desire to be a servant of the servant of the servant of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the maintainer of the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> (<span class="Italic">gop&#299;-bhartu&#7717; pada-kamalayor d&#257;sa-d&#257;s&#257;nud&#257;sa&#7717;</span>). This means that one must accept a spiritual master who comes in the disciplic succession and is a servant of the servant of the Lord. Under his direction, one must then engage one&rsquo;s three properties, namely his body, mind and words. The body should be engaged in physical activity under the order of the master, the mind should think of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a incessantly, and one&rsquo;s words should be engaged in preaching the glories of the Lord. If one is thus engaged in the loving service of the Lord, one&rsquo;s life is successful.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">After V&#7771;tr&#257;sura finished speaking, he released his trident against King Indra with great anger, but Indra, using his thunderbolt, which was many times more powerful than the trident, broke the trident to pieces and cut off one of V&#7771;tr&#257;sura&rsquo;s arms. Nevertheless, V&#7771;tr&#257;sura used his remaining arm to strike Indra with an iron mace, making the thunderbolt fall from Indra&rsquo;s hand. Indra, being very ashamed of this, did not pick up the thunderbolt from the ground, but V&#7771;tr&#257;sura encouraged King Indra to pick it up and fight.

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">&ldquo;The Supreme Personality of Godhead,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is the cause of victory and defeat. Not knowing that the Supreme Lord is the cause of all causes, fools and rascals try to take credit for victory or defeat themselves, but everything is actually under the control of the Lord. No one but Him has any independence. The <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a</span> (the enjoyer) and <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti</span> (the enjoyed) are under the control of the Lord, for it is by His supervision that everything works systematically.

When one understands, however, that the real controller is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is freed from the relativities of the world, such as distress, happiness, fear and impurity.&rdquo; Thus Indra and V&#7771;tr&#257;sura not only fought, but also engaged in philosophical discourses. Then they began to fight again.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by nature.&rdquo; The living entities work only under the direction of the Supreme Lord. The Lord gives orders to material nature, and she arranges facilities for the living entities. The living entities are not independent, although they foolishly think themselves the doers (<span class="Italic">kart&#257;</span>).</div>
<div class="Purport">Victory is always with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As for the subordinate living entities, they fight under the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Victory or defeat is not actually theirs; it is an arrangement by the Lord through the agency of material nature. Pride in victory, or moroseness in defeat, is useless. One should fully depend on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is responsible for the victory and defeat of all living entities. The Lord advises, <span class="Italic">niyata&#7745; kuru karma tva&#7745; karma jy&#257;yo hy akarma&#7751;a&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;Perform your prescribed duty, for action is better than inaction.&rdquo; The living entity is ordered to act according to his position.

<div class="Purport">V&#7771;tr&#257;sura encouraged Indra, saying, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be morose because of my victory. There is no need to stop fighting. Instead, you should go on with your duty.

We should not be jubilant in victory or morose in defeat. We should make a sincere effort to implement the will of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, or &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, and we should not be concerned with victory and defeat.

As the Lord Himself says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a>), <span class="Italic">sarvasya c&#257;ha&#7745; h&#7771;di sannivi&#7779;&#7789;o matta&#7717; sm&#7771;tir j&ntilde;&#257;nam apohana&#7745; ca:</span> &ldquo;I am in everyone&rsquo;s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.&rdquo; Unless one receives dictation from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who sits within everyone&rsquo;s heart, one cannot be induced to create anything. Therefore the father and mother are not the creators of the living entity. According to the living entity&rsquo;s <span class="Italic">karma,</span> fruitive activities, he is put into the semen of the father, who injects the living entity into the womb of the mother. Then according to the body of the mother and father (<span class="Italic">yath&#257;-yoni yath&#257;-b&#299;jam</span>), the living entity accepts a body and takes birth to suffer or enjoy. Therefore the Supreme Lord is the original cause of one&rsquo;s birth. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the cause of one&rsquo;s being killed. No one is independent; everyone is dependent. The true conclusion is that the only independent person is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">It is not good to be falsely puffed up, saying that by one&rsquo;s own effort one has become opulent, learned, beautiful and so on. All such good fortune is achieved through the mercy of the Lord. From another point of view, no one wants to die, and no one wants to be poor or ugly. Therefore, why does the living entity, against his will, receive such unwanted troubles? It is due to the mercy or chastisement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that one gains or loses everything material. No one is independent; everyone is dependent on the mercy or chastisement of the Supreme Lord. There is a common saying in Bengal that the Lord has ten hands. This means that He has control everywhere&mdash;in the eight directions and up and down. If He wants to take everything away from us with His ten hands, we cannot protect anything with our two hands. Similarly, if He wants to bestow benedictions upon us with His ten hands, we cannot factually receive them all with our two hands; in other words, the benedictions exceed our ambitions. The conclusion is that even though we do not wish to be separated from our possessions, sometimes the Lord forcibly takes them from us; and sometimes He showers such benedictions upon us that we are unable to receive them all. Therefore either in opulence or in distress we are not independent; everything is dependent on the sweet will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation">O V&#7771;tr&#257;sura, demons are generally conducted by the mode of passion.

<div class="First">King Indra wondered how V&#7771;tr&#257;sura could have been elevated to the position of an exalted devotee. As for Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, he was initiated by N&#257;rada Muni, and therefore it was possible for him to become a great devotee, although he was born in a family of demons. For V&#7771;tr&#257;sura, however, Indra could not detect such causes. Therefore he was struck with wonder that V&#7771;tr&#257;sura was such an exalted devotee that he could fix his mind without deviation upon the lotus feet of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, V&#257;sudeva.</div>

Even by a glimpse of the chanting of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a&rsquo;s name, one becomes free from all the sinful reactions of killing a woman, a cow or a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> The demigods advised Indra to perform an <span class="Italic">a&#347;vamedha</span> sacrifice, by which N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a would be pleased, for the performer of such a sacrifice is not implicated in sinful reactions even if he kills the entire universe.</div>
</div><A NAME="82052"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Following this instruction from the demigods, King Indra fought V&#7771;tr&#257;sura, but when V&#7771;tr&#257;sura was killed, everyone was satisfied but King Indra, who knew V&#7771;tr&#257;sura&rsquo;s position. This is the nature of a great personality. Even if a great personality acquires some opulence, he is always ashamed and regretful if he acquires it illegally. Indra could understand that he was certainly entangled by sinful reactions for killing a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> Indeed, he could see sinful reaction personified following him, and thus he fled here and there in fear, thinking of how to rid himself of his sins. He went to M&#257;nasa-sarovara, and there, under the protection of the goddess of fortune, he meditated for one thousand years. During this time, Nahu&#7779;a reigned over the heavenly planets as the representative of Indra. Unfortunately, however, he was attracted by the beauty of Indra&rsquo;s wife, &#346;ac&#299;dev&#299;, and because of his sinful desire he had to accept the body of a serpent in his next life. Indra later performed a great sacrifice with the help of exalted <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and saints.

I wish to hear about this. When he killed V&#7771;tr&#257;sura, all the demigods were extremely happy. Why, then, was Indra himself unhappy?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This, of course, is a very intelligent question. When a demon is killed, certainly all the demigods are happy. In this case, however, when all the demigods were happy because of V&#7771;tr&#257;sura&rsquo;s having been killed, Indra was unhappy. Why? It may be suggested that Indra was unhappy because he knew that he had killed a great devotee and <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> V&#7771;tr&#257;sura outwardly appeared to be a demon, but inwardly he was a great devotee and therefore a great <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">Herein it is clearly indicated that a person who is not at all demoniac, such as Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, may outwardly be a demon or be born in a family of demons. Therefore in terms of real culture one should not be considered a demigod or demon simply according to birth. In his dealings while fighting with Indra, V&#7771;tr&#257;sura proved himself a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Furthermore, as soon as he finished fighting with Indra and was apparently killed, V&#7771;tr&#257;sura was transferred to Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka to become an associate of Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a. Indra knew this, and therefore he was morose at having killed such a demon, who was actually a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava or <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">A Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is already a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> although a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> may not be a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. The <span class="Italic">Padma Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> says:</div>

The holy name is so spiritually potent that simply by chanting the holy name one can be freed from the reactions to all sinful activities. What, then, is to be said of those who chant the holy name regularly or worship the Deity regularly? For such purified devotees, freedom from sinful reaction is certainly assured. This does not mean, however, that one should intentionally commit sinful acts and think himself free from the reactions because he is chanting the holy name.

<div class="First">&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura gives the following purport to this verse. Simply desiring <span class="Italic">mukti,</span> or liberation, is insufficient; one must become factually liberated. When one understands the futility of the materialistic way of life, one becomes advanced in knowledge, and therefore he situates himself in the <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha</span> order, unattached to family, wife and children. One should then further progress to the platform of <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa,</span> the actual renounced order, never to fall again and be afflicted by materialistic life. Even though one desires to be liberated, this does not mean he is liberated. Only rarely is someone liberated. Indeed, although many men take <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> to become liberated, because of their imperfections they again become attached to women, material activities, social welfare work and so on.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">J&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s, yog&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> devoid of devotional service are called offenders. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu says, <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;e apar&#257;dh&#299;:</span> one who thinks that everything is <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> instead of thinking that everything is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is called an <span class="Italic">apar&#257;dh&#299;,</span> or offender. Although the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s, impersonalists, are offenders at the lotus feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, they may nonetheless be counted among the <span class="Italic">siddhas,</span> those who have realized the self. They may be considered nearer to spiritual perfection because at least they have realized what spiritual life is. If such a person becomes <span class="Italic">n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a-par&#257;ya&#7751;a,</span> a devotee of Lord N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, he is better than a <span class="Italic">j&#299;van-mukta,</span> one who is liberated or perfect. This requires higher intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purport">There are two kinds of <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s.</span> One is inclined to devotional service and the other to impersonal realization. Impersonalists generally undergo great endeavor for no tangible benefit, and therefore it is said that they are husking paddy that has no grain (<span class="Italic">sth&#363;la-tu&#7779;&#257;vagh&#257;tina&#7717;</span>). The other class of <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s,</span> whose <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na</span> is mixed with <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> are also of two kinds&mdash;those who are devoted to the so-called false form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and those who understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as <span class="Italic">sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha</span><I> <span class="Italic"></I>[</I>Bs. </span>5.1</I>]<span class="Italic"></I>,</span> the actual spiritual form. The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; devotees worship N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a or Vi&#7779;&#7751;u with the idea that Vi&#7779;&#7751;u has accepted a form of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> and that the ultimate truth is actually impersonal. The pure devotee, however, never thinks that Vi&#7779;&#7751;u has accepted a body of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;;</span> instead, he knows perfectly well that the original Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person. Such a devotee is actually situated in knowledge. He never merges in the Brahman effulgence.

There is no distinction between K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s body and His soul, but because less intelligent men see K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as a human being, they deride Him.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Here the most significant statement is that the earth completely produced all the necessities of life during the time of King Citraketu. As stated in the <span class="Italic">&#298;&#347;opani&#7779;ad</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Mantra</span> 1):</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Everything animate or inanimate that is within the universe is controlled and owned by the Lord. One should therefore accept only those things necessary for himself, which are set aside as his quota, and one should not accept other things, knowing well to whom they belong.&rdquo; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the supreme controller, has created the material world, which is completely perfect and free from scarcity. The Lord supplies the necessities of all living entities. These necessities come from the earth, and thus the earth is the source of supply. When there is a good ruler, that source produces the necessities of life abundantly. However, when there is not such a good ruler, there will be scarcity. This is the significance of the word <span class="Italic">k&#257;madhuk.</span> Elsewhere in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="index0c75.html?g=9497">1.10.4</a>) it is said, <span class="Italic">k&#257;ma&#7745; vavar&#7779;a parjanya&#7717; sarva-k&#257;ma-dugh&#257; mah&#299;:</span> &ldquo;During the reign of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, the clouds showered all the water that people needed, and the earth produced all the necessities of men in profusion.&rdquo; We have experience that in some seasons the rains produce abundance and in other seasons there is scarcity. We have no control over the earth&rsquo;s productiveness, for it is naturally under the full control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By His order, the Lord can make the earth produce sufficiently or insufficiently. If a pious king rules the earth according to the &#347;&#257;stric injunctions, there will naturally be regular rainfall and sufficient produce to provide for all men. There will be no question of exploitation, for everyone will have enough. Black-marketeering and other corrupt dealings will then automatically stop. Simply ruling the land cannot solve man&rsquo;s problems unless the leader has spiritual capabilities. He must be like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja or R&#257;macandra. Then all the inhabitants of the land will be extremely happy.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The word <span class="Italic">har&#7779;a</span> means &ldquo;jubilation,&rdquo; and <span class="Italic">&#347;oka</span> means &ldquo;lamentation.&rdquo; The King was overwhelmed with joy when he understood that he would have a son. Because of his great jubilation, he could not actually understand the statement of the sage A&#7749;gir&#257;. He accepted it to mean that there would certainly be jubilation because of the birth of his future son, but that he would be the King&rsquo;s only son and, being very proud of his great wealth and empire, would not be very obedient to his father. Thus the King was satisfied, thinking, &ldquo;Let there be a son. It does not matter if he is not very obedient.&rdquo; In Bengal there is a proverb that instead of having no maternal uncle, it is better to have a maternal uncle who is blind. The King accepted this philosophy, thinking that a disobedient son would be better than no son at all. The great sage C&#257;&#7751;akya Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">ko &rsquo;rtha&#7717; putre&#7751;a j&#257;tena<br>yo na vidv&#257;n na dh&#257;rmika&#7717;<br>k&#257;&#7751;ena cak&#7779;u&#7779;&#257; ki&#7745; v&#257;<br>cak&#7779;u&#7717; p&#299;&#7693;aiva kevalam</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;What is the use of a son who is neither a learned scholar nor a devotee? Such a son is like a blind, diseased eye, which always causes suffering.&rdquo; Nevertheless, the material world is so polluted that one wants to have a son even though he is useless. This attitude was represented in the history of King Citraketu.</div>

Again, if You say that a controller is needed because the material energy does not have the power to act, one may answer that if the bonds of affection You have created are disturbed by fruitive action, no one will raise children with affection; instead, everyone will cruelly neglect his children.

The relationship did not exist before, nor will it stay in the future. By the arrangement of time, the relationship exists only in the present. One should not lament for temporary relationships. The entire cosmic manifestation is temporary; although not unreal, it is not factual. By the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everything created in the material world is transient. By a temporary arrangement, a father begets a child, or a living entity becomes the child of a so-called father. This temporary arrangement is made by the Supreme Lord. Neither the father nor the son exists independently.</div>

The great sages presented who they were and instructed that all sufferings are due to the bodily conception of life. When one understands his spiritual identity and surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the supreme spiritual person, one becomes actually happy. When one searches for happiness in matter, one must certainly lament for bodily relationships. Self-realization means spiritual realization of one&rsquo;s relationship with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The misunderstanding of the conditioned soul is the bodily conception of life. The body is material, but within the body is the soul. This is spiritual understanding. Unfortunately, one who is in ignorance, under the spell of material illusion, accepts the body to be the self. He cannot understand that the body is matter. Like small particles of sand, bodies come together and are separated by the force of time, and people falsely lament for unification and separation. Unless one knows this, there is no question of happiness. Therefore in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexf962.html?g=502">2.13</a>) this is the first instruction given by the Lord:</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.&rdquo; We are not the body; we are spiritual beings trapped in the body. Our real interest lies in understanding this simple fact. Then we can make further spiritual progress. Otherwise, if we remain in the bodily conception of life, our miserable material existence will continue forever. Political adjustments, social welfare work, medical assistance and the other programs we have manufactured for peace and happiness will never endure. We shall have to undergo the sufferings of material life one after another. Therefore material life is said to be <span class="Italic">du&#7717;kh&#257;layam a&#347;&#257;&#347;vatam</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexf129.html?g=2868">8.15</a>]<span class="Italic">;</span> it is a reservoir of miserable conditions.</div>

<div class="Translation">When seeds are sown in the ground, they sometimes grow into plants and sometimes do not. Sometimes the ground is not fertile, and the sowing of seeds is unproductive. Similarly, sometimes a prospective father, being impelled by the potency of the Supreme Lord, can beget a child, but sometimes conception does not take place. Therefore one should not lament over the artificial relationship of parenthood, which is ultimately controlled by the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Citraketu was actually not destined to get a son. Therefore although he married hundreds and thousands of wives, all of them proved barren, and he could not beget even one child. When A&#7749;gir&#257; &#7770;&#7779;i came to see the King, the King requested the great sage to enable him to have at least one son. Because of the blessing of A&#7749;gir&#257; &#7770;&#7779;i, a child was sent by the grace of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> but the child was not to live for long. Therefore in the beginning A&#7749;gir&#257; &#7770;&#7779;i told the King that he would beget a child who would cause jubilation and lamentation.</div>
<div class="Purport">King Citraketu was not destined to get a child by providence, or the will of the Supreme. Just as sterile grain cannot produce more grain, a sterile person, by the will of the Supreme Lord, cannot beget a child. Sometimes a child is born even to an impotent father and sterile mother, and sometimes a potent father and fertile mother are childless. Indeed, sometimes a child is born despite contraceptive methods, and therefore the parents kill the child in the womb. In the present age, killing children in the womb has become a common practice. Why? When contraceptive methods are taken, why don&rsquo;t they act? Why is a child sometimes produced so that the father and mother have to kill it in the womb? We must conclude that our arrangement of so-called scientific knowledge cannot determine what will take place; what is enacted actually depends on the supreme will. It is by the supreme will that we are situated in certain conditions in terms of family, community and personality. These are all arrangements of the Supreme Lord according to our desires under the spell of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> illusion. In devotional life, therefore, one should not desire anything, since everything depends on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhakti-ras&#257;m&#7771;ta-sindhu</span> (1.1.11):</div>

According to the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava philosophy, however, the present situation is not false but temporary. It is like a dream. A dream does not exist before one falls asleep, nor does it continue after one awakens. The period for dreaming exists only between these two, and therefore it is false in the sense that it is impermanent. Similarly, the entire material creation, including our own creation and those of others, is impermanent. We do not lament for the situation in a dream before the dream takes place or after it is over, and so during the dream, or during a dreamlike situation, one should not accept it as factual and lament about it. This is real knowledge.</div>

<div class="Translation">The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master and proprietor of everything, is certainly not interested in the temporary cosmic manifestation. Nonetheless, just as a boy at the beach creates something in which he is not interested, the Lord, keeping everything under His control, causes creation, maintenance and annihilation. He creates by engaging a father to beget a son, He maintains by engaging a government or king to see to the public&rsquo;s welfare, and He annihilates through agents for killing, such as snakes. The agents for creation, maintenance and annihilation have no independent potency, but because of the spell of the illusory energy, one thinks himself the creator, maintainer and annihilator.</div>

As an agent of the supreme doer, the Supreme Lord, one should abide by the Lord&rsquo;s orders. The present chaotic conditions of the world are due to the ignorance of leaders who forget that they have been appointed to act by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because they have been appointed by the Lord, their duty is to consult the Lord and act accordingly.

<div class="Translation">O great souls, I have heard that among the great and perfect persons wandering the surface of the earth to instruct knowledge to people covered by ignorance are Sanat-kum&#257;ra, N&#257;rada, &#7770;bhu, A&#7749;gir&#257;, Devala, Asita, Ap&#257;ntaratam&#257; [Vy&#257;sadeva], M&#257;rka&#7751;&#7693;eya, Gautama, Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha, Bhagav&#257;n Para&#347;ur&#257;ma, Kapila, &#346;ukadeva, Durv&#257;s&#257;, Y&#257;j&ntilde;avalkya, J&#257;tukar&#7751;a and Aru&#7751;i. Others are Roma&#347;a, Cyavana, Datt&#257;treya, &#256;suri, Pata&ntilde;jali, the great sage Dhaumya who is like the head of the Vedas, the sage Pa&ntilde;ca&#347;ikha, Hira&#7751;yan&#257;bha, Kau&#347;alya, &#346;rutadeva and &#7770;tadhvaja. You must certainly be among them.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The word <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na-hetava&#7717;</span> is very significant because great personalities like those listed in these verses wander on the surface of the globe not to mislead the populace, but to distribute real knowledge. Without this knowledge, human life is wasted. The human form of life is meant for realization of one&rsquo;s relationship with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, or God. One who lacks this knowledge is categorized among the animals. The Lord Himself says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index8b11.html?g=2595">7.15</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">na m&#257;&#7745; du&#7779;k&#7771;tino m&#363;&#7693;h&#257;&#7717;<br>prapadyante nar&#257;dham&#257;&#7717;<br>m&#257;yay&#257;pah&#7771;ta-j&ntilde;&#257;n&#257;<br>&#257;sura&#7745; bh&#257;vam &#257;&#347;rit&#257;&#7717;</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">Ignorance is the bodily conception of life (<span class="Italic">yasy&#257;tma-buddhi&#7717; ku&#7751;ape tri-dh&#257;tuke.</span> <span class="Italic">...sa eva go-khara&#7717;</I> [SB </span></I>10.84.13]). Practically everyone throughout the universe, especially on this planet, Bh&#363;rloka, thinks that there is no separate existence of the body and soul and therefore no need of self-realization. But that is not a fact. Therefore all the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> listed here, being devotees, travel all over the world to awaken K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness in the hearts of such foolish materialists.</div>
<div class="Purport">The <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> mentioned in these verses are described in the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata.</span> The word <span class="Italic">pa&ntilde;ca&#347;ikha</span> is also important. One who is liberated from the conceptions of <span class="Italic">annamaya, pr&#257;&#7751;amaya, manomaya, vij&ntilde;&#257;namaya</span> and <span class="Italic">&#257;nandamaya</span> and who is perfectly aware of the subtle coverings of the soul is called <span class="Italic">pa&ntilde;ca&#347;ikha.</span> According to the statements of the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> (<span class="Italic">S&#257;nti-parva,</span> Chapters 218&ndash;219), an <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya</span> named Pa&ntilde;ca&#347;ikha took birth in the family of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Janaka, the ruler of Mithila. The S&#257;&#7749;khya philosophers accept Pa&ntilde;ca&#347;ikh&#257;c&#257;rya as one of them. Real knowledge pertains to the living entity dwelling within the body. Unfortunately, because of ignorance, the living entity identifies himself with the body and therefore feels pleasure and pain.</div>

<div class="Translation">My dear King, you are an advanced devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

For those who are advanced in spiritual knowledge to be affected by material loss and gain is not at all desirable.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Several words in this verse are very important. The word <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-puru&#7779;a</span> refers to advanced devotees and also to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;</span> means &ldquo;the supreme,&rdquo; and <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a</span> means &ldquo;person.&rdquo; One who always engages in the service of the Supreme Lord is called <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-pauru&#7779;ika.</span> &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it are sometimes addressed as <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-pauru&#7779;ika.</span> A devotee should always aspire to engage in the service of advanced devotees. As &#346;r&#299;la Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura has sung:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">t&#257;&#7749;dera cara&#7751;a sevi bhakta-sane v&#257;sa<br>janame janame haya, ei abhil&#257;&#7779;a</div>
</div><A NAME="83369"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">A devotee should always aspire to live in the association of advanced devotees and engage in the service of the Lord through the <span class="Italic">parampar&#257;</span> system. One should serve the mission of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu through the instructions of the great Gosv&#257;m&#299;s of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana. This is called <span class="Italic">t&#257;&#7749;dera cara&#7751;a sevi.</span> While serving the lotus feet of the Gosv&#257;m&#299;s, one should live in the association of devotees (<span class="Italic">bhakta-sane v&#257;sa</span>). This is the business of a devotee. A devotee should not aspire for material profit or lament for material loss. When A&#7749;gir&#257; &#7770;&#7779;i and N&#257;rada saw that Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Citraketu, an advanced devotee, had fallen in the darkness of ignorance and was lamenting for the material body of his son, by their causeless mercy they came to advise him so that he could be saved from this ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purport">Another significant word is <span class="Italic">brahma&#7751;ya.</span> The Supreme Personality of Godhead is sometimes addressed by the prayer <span class="Italic">namo brahma&#7751;ya-dev&#257;ya,</span> which offers obeisances unto the Lord because He is served by the devotees. Therefore this verse states, <span class="Italic">brahma&#7751;yo bhagavad-bhakto n&#257;v&#257;s&#257;ditum arhasi.</span> This is the symptom of an advanced devotee. <span class="Italic">Brahma-bh&#363;ta&#7717; prasann&#257;tm&#257;</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexc2a1.html?g=5889">18.54</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> For a devotee&mdash;an advanced, self-realized soul&mdash;there is no cause for material jubilation or lamentation. He is always transcendental to conditional life.</div>

<div class="Translation">My dear King, now you are actually experiencing the misery of a person who has sons and daughters. O King, owner of the state of &#346;&#363;rasena, one&rsquo;s wife, his house, the opulence of his kingdom, and his various other opulences and objects of sense perception are all the same in that they are temporary. One&rsquo;s kingdom, military power, treasury, servants, ministers, friends and relatives are all causes of fear, illusion, lamentation and distress. They are like a gandharva-nagara, a nonexistent palace that one imagines to exist in the forest. Because they are impermanent, they are no better than illusions, dreams and mental concoctions.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This verse describes the entanglement of material existence. In material existence, the living entity possesses many things&mdash;the material body, children, wife and so on (<span class="Italic">deh&#257;patya-kalatr&#257;di&#7779;u</span>). One may think that these will give him protection, but that is impossible. In spite of all these possessions, the spirit soul has to give up his present situation and accept another. The next situation may be unfavorable, but even if it is favorable, one must give it up and again accept another body. In this way, one&rsquo;s tribulation in material existence continues. A sane man should he perfectly aware that these things will never be able to give him happiness. One must be situated in his spiritual identity and eternally serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead as a devotee. A&#7749;gir&#257; &#7770;&#7779;i and N&#257;rada Muni gave this instruction to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Citraketu.</div>

<div class="First">Everything material is a mental concoction because it is sometimes visible and sometimes not.

Similarly, the material world is a creation of our mental concoctions. We have come to this material world to enjoy material resources, and by mental concoction we discover many, many objects of enjoyment because our minds are absorbed in material things. This is why we receive various bodies. According to our mental concoctions we work in various ways, desiring various achievements, and by nature and the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (<span class="Italic">karma&#7751;&#257;-daiva-netre&#7751;a</span>) we get the advantages we desire. Thus we become more and more involved with material concoctions. This is the reason for our suffering in the material world. By one kind of activity we create another, and they are all products of our mental concoctions.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">The living entity in the bodily conception of life is absorbed in the body, which is a combination of the physical elements, the five senses for gathering knowledge, and the five senses of action, along with the mind. Through the mind the living entity suffers three kinds of tribulations&mdash;adhibhautika, adhidaivika and adhy&#257;tmika. Therefore this body is a source of all miseries.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the Fifth Canto (5.5.4), while instructing his sons, &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva said, <span class="Italic">asann api kle&#347;ada &#257;sa deha&#7717;:</span> the body, although temporary, is the cause of all the miseries of material existence. As already discussed in the previous verse, the entire material creation is based on mental concoction. The mind sometimes induces us to think that if we purchase an automobile we can enjoy the physical elements, such as earth, water, air and fire, combined in forms of iron, plastic, petrol and so on. Working with the five material elements (<span class="Italic">pa&ntilde;ca-bh&#363;tas</span>), as well as with our five knowledge-gathering senses like the eyes, ears and tongue and our five active senses like the hands and legs, we become involved in the material condition. Thus we are subjected to the tribulations known as <span class="Italic">adhy&#257;tmika, adhidaivika</span> and <span class="Italic">adhibhautika.</span> The mind is the center because the mind creates all these things. As soon as the material object is struck, however, the mind is affected, and we suffer. For example, with the material elements, the working senses and the knowledge-gathering senses we create a very nice car, and when the car is accidentally smashed in a collision, the mind suffers, and through the mind the living entity suffers.</div>
<div class="Purport">The fact is that the living entity, while concocting with the mind, creates the material condition. Because matter is destructible, through the material condition the living entity suffers. Otherwise, the living entity is detached from all material conditions. When one comes to the Brahman platform, the platform of spiritual life, fully understanding that he is a spiritual soul (<span class="Italic">), he is no longer affected by lamentation or hankering. As the Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexc2a1.html?g=5889">18.54</a>):</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything.&rdquo; Elsewhere in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index6669.html?g=4886">15.7</a>) the Lord says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">mamaiv&#257;&#7745;&#347;o j&#299;va-loke<br>j&#299;va-bh&#363;ta&#7717; san&#257;tana&#7717;<br>mana&#7717;-&#7779;a&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;n&#299;ndriy&#257;&#7751;i<br>prak&#7771;ti-sth&#257;ni kar&#7779;ati</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal fragmental parts.

When one understands this simple fact, he can direct himself toward the goal of life. Because people are not educated in terms of the goal of life, they are working like madmen and becoming more and more attached to the material atmosphere. The misguided man accepts the material condition as everlasting. One must give up his faith in material things and give up attachment for them. Then one will be sober and peaceful.</div>

According to the reactions of one&rsquo;s fruitive activities, one takes birth in various species of life among the birds, beasts, trees, human beings, demigods and so on, thus rotating through various bodies. For a certain period of time, one receives a particular type of body as a son or father in a false relationship. All our relationships in this material world with friends, relatives or enemies consist of duality, in which one feels happy and distressed on the basis of illusion. The living entity is actually a spiritual soul who is part and parcel of God and has nothing to do with relationships in the world of duality.

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">After hearing instructions from their dead child, Citraketu and his wife could understand that all relationships in this material world are causes of misery. The queens who had administered poison to the son of K&#7771;tadyuti were very much ashamed. They atoned for the sinful act of killing a child and gave up their aspiration to have sons. Thereafter. N&#257;rada Muni chanted prayers to N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, who exists as <span class="Italic">catur-vy&#363;ha,</span> and instructed Citraketu about the Supreme Lord, who creates, maintains and annihilates everything and who is the master of the material nature. After instructing King Citraketu in this way, he returned to Brahmaloka. These instructions about the Absolute Truth are called the <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-vidy&#257;.</span> After being initiated by N&#257;rada Muni, King Citraketu chanted the <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-vidy&#257;,</span> and after one week he attained the presence of Lord Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a, who was surrounded by the four Kum&#257;ras. The Lord was nicely dressed in bluish garments, with a helmet and ornaments of gold. His face appeared very happy.

The difference between worshiping the Lord and worshiping the demigods is that the worshiper of the Lord also becomes eternal, whereas whatever benedictions one can get from the demigods are impermanent.

Therefore, in which birth were these my mother and father? No one is actually my mother and father. How can I accept these two people as my parents?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Here it is made clear that the living being enters a material body that is like a machine created by the five gross elements of material nature (earth, water, fire, air and sky) and the three subtle elements (mind, intelligence and ego).

<div class="Purport">This time the living entity was supposed to have been the son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Citraketu and Queen K&#7771;tadyuti because according to the laws of nature he had entered a body made by the King and Queen. Actually, however, he was not their son. The living entity is the son of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and because he wants to enjoy this material world, the Supreme Lord gives him a chance to enter various bodies. The living entity has no true relationship with the material body he gets from his material father and mother. He is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but he is allowed to go through different bodies. The body created by the so-called father and mother actually has nothing to do with its so-called creators. Therefore the living entity flatly denied that Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Citraketu and his wife were his father and mother.</div>

<div class="First">It is our practical experience in this material world that the same person who is one&rsquo;s friend today becomes one&rsquo;s enemy tomorrow.

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Just as gold and other commodities are continually transferred from one place to another in due course of purchase and sale, so the living entity, as a result of his fruitive activities, wanders throughout the entire universe, being injected into various bodies in different species of life by one kind of father after another.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">It has already been explained that Citraketu&rsquo;s son was his enemy in a past life and had now appeared as his son just to give him more severe pain. Indeed, the untimely death of the son caused severe lamentation for the father. One may put forward the argument, &ldquo;If the King&rsquo;s son was his enemy, how could the King have so much affection for him?&rdquo; In answer, the example is given that when someone&rsquo;s wealth falls into the bands of his enemy, the money becomes the enemy&rsquo;s friend. Then the enemy can use it for his own purposes. Indeed, he can even use it to harm its previous owner. Therefore the money belongs neither to the one party nor to the other. The money is always money, but in different situations it can be used as an enemy or a friend.</div>
<div class="Purport">As explained in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> it is not by any father or mother that the living entity is given his birth. The living entity is a completely separate identity from the so-called father and mother. By the laws of nature, the living entity is forced to enter the semen of a father and be injected into the womb of the mother. He is not in control of selecting what kind of father he will accept. <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;te&#7717; kriyam&#257;&#7751;&#257;ni:</span> the laws of nature force him to go to different fathers and mothers, just like a consumer commodity that is purchased and sold. Therefore the so-called relationship of father and son is an arrangement of <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti,</span> or nature. It has no meaning, and therefore it is called illusion.</div>
<div class="Purport">The same living entity sometimes takes shelter of an animal father and mother and sometimes a human father and mother. Sometimes he accepts a father and mother among the birds, and sometimes he accepts a demigod father and mother. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu therefore says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">brahm&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a bhramite kona bh&#257;gyav&#257;n j&#299;va<br>guru-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-pras&#257;de p&#257;ya bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja</div>
</div><A NAME="83573"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">Harassed life after life by the laws of nature, the living entity wanders throughout the entire universe in different planets and different species of life. Somehow or other, if he is fortunate enough, he comes in touch with a devotee who reforms his entire life. Then the living entity goes back home, back to Godhead. Therefore it is said:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">janame janame sabe pit&#257; m&#257;t&#257; p&#257;ya<br>k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a guru nahi mile baja hari ei</div>
</div><A NAME="83575"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">In the transmigration of the soul through different bodies, everyone, in every form of life&mdash;be it human, animal, tree or demigod&mdash;gets a father and mother. This is not very difficult. The difficulty is to obtain a bona fide spiritual master and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Therefore the duty of a human being is to capture the opportunity to come in touch with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s representative, the bona fide spiritual master. Under the guidance of the spiritual master, the spiritual father, one can return home, back to Godhead.</div>

The living entity, however, is permanent. As an animal is transferred from one owner to another, the living entity who was the son of Citraketu lived as his son for some time, but as soon as he was transferred to another body, the affectionate relationship was broken. As stated in the example given in the previous verse, when one has a commodity in his hands he considers it his, but as soon as it is transferred it becomes someone else&rsquo;s commodity. Then one no longer has a relationship with it; he has no affection for it, nor does he lament for it.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">The living entity is eternal and imperishable because he actually has no beginning and no end. He never takes birth or dies. He is the basic principle of all types of bodies, yet he does not belong to the bodily category. The living being is so sublime that he is equal in quality to the Supreme Lord. Nonetheless, because he is extremely small, he is prone to be illusioned by the external energy, and thus he creates various bodies for himself according to his different desires.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In this verse the philosophy of <span class="Italic">acintya-bhed&#257;bheda</span>&mdash;simultaneous oneness and difference&mdash;is described. The living entity is eternal (<span class="Italic">nitya</span>) like the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the difference is that the Supreme Lord is the greatest, no one being equal to or greater than Him, whereas the living entity is <span class="Italic">s&#363;k&#7779;ma,</span> or extremely small. The <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra</span> describes that the magnitude of the living entity is one ten-thousandth the size of the tip of a hair. The Supreme Lord is all-pervading (<span class="Italic">a&#7751;&#7693;&#257;ntara-stha-param&#257;&#7751;u-cay&#257;ntara-stham</span>). Relatively, if the living entity is accepted as the smallest, there should naturally be inquiry about the greatest. The greatest is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the smallest is the living entity.</div>
<div class="Purport">Another peculiar characteristic of the <span class="Italic">j&#299;va</span> is that he becomes covered by <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> <span class="Italic">&#256;tmam&#257;y&#257;-gu&#7751;ai&#7717;:</span> he is prone to being covered by the Supreme Lord&rsquo;s illusory energy. The living entity is responsible for his conditional life in the material world, and therefore he is described as <span class="Italic">prabhu</span> (&ldquo;the master&rdquo;). If he likes he can come to this material world, and if he likes he can return home, back to Godhead.

<div class="Purport">The living entity is the smallest (<span class="Italic">s&#363;k&#7779;ma</span>).

<div class="Translation">For this living entity, no one is dear, nor is anyone unfavorable. He makes no distinction between that which is his own and that which belongs to anyone else. He is one without a second; in other words, he is not affected by friends and enemies, well-wishers or mischief-mongers. He is only an observer, a witness, of the different qualities of men.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">As explained in the previous verse, the living entity has the same qualities as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but he has them in minute quantities because he is a small particle (<span class="Italic">s&#363;k&#7779;ma</span>) whereas the Supreme Lord is all-pervading and great. For the Supreme Lord there are no friends, enemies or relatives, for He is completely free from all the disqualifications of ignorance that characterize the conditioned souls. On the other hand, He is extremely kind and favorable to His devotees, and He is not at all satisfied with persons who are envious of His devotees. As the Lord Himself confirms in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index90b5.html?g=3246">9.29</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">samo &rsquo;ha&#7745; sarva-bh&#363;te&#7779;u<br>na me dve&#7779;yo &rsquo;sti na priya&#7717;<br>ye bhajanti tu m&#257;&#7745; bhakty&#257;<br>mayi te te&#7779;u c&#257;py aham</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him.&rdquo; The Supreme Lord has no enemy or friend, but He is inclined toward a devotee who always engages in His devotional service. Similarly, elsewhere in the <span class="Ref_Italic">G&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexeb92.html?g=5150">16.19</a>) the Lord says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">t&#257;n aha&#7745; dvi&#7779;ata&#7717; kr&#363;r&#257;n<br>sa&#7745;s&#257;re&#7779;u nar&#257;dham&#257;n<br>k&#7779;ip&#257;my ajasram a&#347;ubh&#257;n<br>&#257;sur&#299;&#7779;v eva yoni&#7779;u</div>
</div><A NAME="83639"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life.&rdquo; The Lord is extremely antagonistic toward those who are envious of His devotees. To protect His devotees, the Lord sometimes has to kill their enemies. For example, to protect Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, the Lord had to kill his enemy Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, although Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu attained salvation because of being killed by the Lord. Since the Lord is the witness of everyone&rsquo;s activities, He witnesses the actions of the enemies of His devotees, and He is inclined to punish them. In other cases, however, He simply witnesses what the living entities do and gives the results of one&rsquo;s sinful or pious actions.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">The Supreme Lord [&#257;tm&#257;], the creator of cause and effect, does not accept the happiness and distress that result from fruitive actions. He is completely independent of having to accept a material body, and because He has no material body, He is always neutral. The living entities, being part and parcel of the Lord, possess His qualities in a minute quantity. Therefore one should not be affected by lamentation.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The conditioned soul has friends and enemies. He is affected by the good qualities and the faults of his position. The Supreme Lord, however, is always transcendental. Because He is the <span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;vara,</span> the supreme controller, He is not affected by duality. It may therefore be said that He sits in the core of everyone&rsquo;s heart as the neutral witness of the causes and effects of one&rsquo;s activities, good and bad. We should also understand that <span class="Italic">ud&#257;s&#299;na,</span> neutral, does not mean that He takes no action. Rather, it means that He is not personally affected. For example, a court judge is neutral when two opposing parties appear before him, but he still takes action as the case warrants. To become completely neutral, indifferent, to material activities, we should simply seek shelter at the lotus feet of the supreme neutral person.</div>
<div class="Purport">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Citraketu was advised that remaining neutral in such trying circumstances as the death of one&rsquo;s son is impossible. Nevertheless, since the Lord knows how to adjust everything, the best course is to depend upon Him and do one&rsquo;s duty in devotional service to the Lord. In all circumstances, one should be undisturbed by duality. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index7196.html?g=803">2.47</a>):</div>

<div class="Translation">Queen K&#7771;tyadyuti&rsquo;s co-wives, who had poisoned the child, were very much ashamed, and they lost all their bodily luster. While lamenting, O King, they remembered the instructions of A&#7749;gir&#257; and gave up their ambition to bear children.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In this verse the word <span class="Italic">b&#257;la-haty&#257;-hata-prabh&#257;&#7717;</span> is to be particularly noted. The practice of killing children has existed in human society for a long time&mdash;since time immemorial&mdash;but in the days of yore it was very rarely performed. At the present moment, however, in this age of Kali, abortion&mdash;killing of the child within the womb&mdash;has become very common, and sometimes a child is even killed after birth. If a woman performs such an abominable act, she gradually loses all her bodily luster (<span class="Italic">b&#257;la-haty&#257;-hata-prabh&#257;&#7717;</span>). It is also to be noted that the ladies who had committed the sinful act of administering poison to the child were very much ashamed, and according to the directions of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> they had to undergo atonement for killing the child. Any woman who has ever performed such an infamously sinful act must atone for it, but no one now is doing that. Under the circumstances, the women responsible must suffer in this life and the next. Those who are sincere souls, after hearing this incident, should refrain from such child-killing and should atone for their sinful activities by taking to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness very seriously. If one chants the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra</span> without offenses, all of one&rsquo;s sinful actions are surely atoned for immediately, but one should not commit such deeds again, for that is an offense.</div>

From Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a comes a second N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a expansion, and from this N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a come further expansions of V&#257;sudeva, Pradyumna, Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a and Aniruddha. The Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a in this group is the original cause of the three <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;as,</span> namely K&#257;ra&#7751;odaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and K&#7779;&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. K&#7779;&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is situated in every universe in a special planet called &#346;vetadv&#299;pa.

Within this universe is a planet called &#346;vetadv&#299;pa, where K&#7779;&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is situated.

<div class="Purport">As confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;,</span> all these forms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are <span class="Italic">advaita,</span> nondifferent, and they are also <span class="Italic">acyuta,</span> infallible; they do not fall down like the conditioned souls. The ordinary living entity is prone to falling into the clutches of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> but the Supreme Lord in His different incarnations and forms is <span class="Italic">acyuta,</span> infallible. Therefore His body is different from the material body possessed by the conditioned soul.</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">m&#257;tr&#257;</span> is explained in the Medin&#299; dictionary as follows: <span class="Italic">m&#257;tr&#257; kar&#7751;a-vibh&#363;&#7779;&#257;y&#257;&#7745; vitte m&#257;ne paricchade.</span> The word <span class="Italic">m&#257;tr&#257;,</span> in its different imports, is used to indicate the decoration of the ear, possession, respect, and the possession of a covering.

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;O son of Kunt&#299;, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.&rdquo; In the conditioned state of life, the body is used as our dress, and as one needs different dresses during the summer and winter, we conditioned souls are changing bodies according to our desires. However, because the body of the Supreme Lord is full of knowledge, it needs no covering. The idea that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s body is like ours&mdash;in other words, that His body and soul are different&mdash;is a misunderstanding. There are no such differences for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, because His body is full of knowledge. Here we receive material bodies because of a lack of knowledge, but because K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, V&#257;sudeva, is full of knowledge, there is no difference between His body and His soul. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a remembers what He said forty million years ago to the sun-god, but an ordinary being cannot remember what he said the day before yesterday. This is the difference between K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s body and our body. Therefore the Lord is addressed as <span class="Italic">vij&ntilde;&#257;na-m&#257;tr&#257;ya param&#257;nanda-m&#363;rtaye.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">Because the Lord&rsquo;s body is full of knowledge, He always enjoys transcendental bliss. Indeed, His very form is <span class="Italic">param&#257;nanda.</span> This is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra:</span> <span class="Italic">&#257;nandamayo&rsquo;bhy&#257;s&#257;t.</span> By nature the Lord is <span class="Italic">&#257;nandamaya.</span> Whenever we see K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, He is always full of <span class="Italic">&#257;nanda</span> in all circumstances. No one can make Him morose. <span class="Italic">&#256;tm&#257;r&#257;m&#257;ya:</span> He does not need to search for external enjoyment, because He is self-sufficient. <span class="Italic">&#346;&#257;nt&#257;ya:</span> He has no anxiety. One who has to seek pleasure from other sources is always full of anxiety. <span class="Italic">Karm&#299;s, j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> are full of anxiety because they want something, but a devotee does not want anything; he is simply satisfied in the service of the Lord, who is fully blissful.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Niv&#7771;tta-dvaita-d&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;aye:</span> in our conditioned life our bodies have different parts, but although K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a apparently has different bodily parts, no part of His body is different from any other part. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a can see with His eyes, and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a can see without His eyes. Therefore in the <span class="Italic">&#346;vet&#257;&#347;vatara Upani&#7779;ad</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">pa&#347;yaty acak&#7779;u&#7717;.</span> He can see with His hands and legs. He does not need a particular bodily part to perform a particular action. <span class="Italic">A&#7749;g&#257;ni yasya sakalendriya-v&#7771;ttimanti:</span> He can do anything He desires with any part of His body, and therefore He is called almighty.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This verse analytically differentiates the living entity from the Supreme Lord. The form of the Lord and the form of the conditioned soul are different because the Lord is always blissful whereas the conditioned soul is always under the threefold miseries of the material world. The Supreme Lord is <span class="Italic">sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha</span><I> <span class="Italic"></I>[</I>Bs. </span>5.1</I>]<span class="Italic"></I>.</span> He derives <span class="Italic">&#257;nanda,</span> bliss, from His own self. The Lord&rsquo;s body is transcendental, spiritual, but because the conditioned soul has a material body, he has many bodily and mental troubles. The conditioned soul is always perturbed by attachment and detachment, whereas the Supreme Lord is always free from such dualities. The Lord is the supreme master of all the senses, whereas the conditioned soul is controlled by the senses. The Lord is the greatest, whereas the living entity is the smallest. The living entity is conditioned by the waves of material nature, but the Supreme Lord is transcendental to all actions and reactions. The expansions of the Supreme Lord&rsquo;s body are innumerable (<span class="Italic">advaitam acyutam an&#257;dim ananta-r&#363;pam</I> [Bs </span></I>5.33]), but the conditioned soul is limited to only one form. From history we learn that a conditioned soul, by mystic power, can sometimes expand into eight forms, but the Lord&rsquo;s bodily expansions are unlimited. This means that the bodies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead have no beginning and no end, unlike the bodies of the living entities.</div>

<div class="Translation">As iron has the power to burn when made red-hot in the association of fire, so the body, senses, living force, mind and intelligence, although merely lumps of matter, can function in their activities when infused with a particle of consciousness by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Red-hot iron can burn, but it cannot burn the original fire. Therefore the consciousness of the small particle of Brahman is fully dependent on the power of the Supreme Brahman. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the Lord says, <span class="Italic">matta&#7717; sm&#7771;tir j&ntilde;&#257;nam apohana&#7745; ca:</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a></I>]</I> &ldquo;From Me the conditioned soul receives memory, knowledge and forgetfulness.&rdquo; The power for activities comes from the Supreme Lord, and when the Lord withdraws this power, the conditioned soul no longer has energy with which to act through his various senses. The body includes five knowledge-acquiring senses, five active senses and the mind, but actually these are merely lumps of matter. For example, the brain is nothing but matter, but when electrified by the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the brain can act, just as iron can burn when made red-hot by the influence of fire. The brain can act while we are awake or even while we are dreaming, but when we are fast asleep or unconscious the brain is inactive. Since the brain is a lump of matter, it does not have independent power with which to act. It can act only when favored by the influence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is Brahman or Parabrahman. This is the way to understand how the Supreme Brahman, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, is present everywhere, just as the sunshine is present because of the sun-god in the sun globe. The Supreme Lord is called H&#7771;&#7779;&#299;ke&#347;a; He is the only conductor of the senses. Unless empowered by His energy, our senses cannot act. In other words, He is the only seer, the only worker, the only listener, and the only active principle or supreme controller.</div>

The devotees may sometimes not be competent to serve the lotus feet of the Lord, and therefore the Lord is addressed as <span class="Italic">parama-parame&#7779;&#7789;hin.</span> He is the Supreme Person, yet He is very kind to the devotees.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">A devotee&rsquo;s ultimate achievement is to take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord in any one of the planets in the spiritual sky. As a result of rigid execution of devotional service, a devotee receives all material opulences if these are required; otherwise, the devotee is not interested in material opulences, nor does the Supreme Lord award them. When a devotee is actually engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, his apparently material opulences are not material; they are all spiritual. For example, if a devotee spends money to construct a beautiful and costly temple, the construction is not material but spiritual (<span class="Italic">nirbandha&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-sambandhe yukta&#7745; vair&#257;gyam ucyate</span>). A devotee&rsquo;s mind is never diverted to the material side of the temple. The bricks, stone and wood used in the construction of the temple are spiritual, just as the Deity, although made of stone, is not stone but the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. The more one advances in spiritual consciousness, the more he can understand the elements of devotional service. Nothing in devotional service is material; everything is spiritual. Consequently a devotee is awarded so-called material opulence for spiritual advancement. This opulence is an aid to help the devotee advance toward the spiritual kingdom. Thus Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Citraketu remained in material opulence as a <span class="Italic">vidy&#257;dhara-pati,</span> master of the Vidy&#257;dharas, and by executing devotional service he became perfect within a very few days and returned home, back to Godhead, taking shelter of the lotus feet of Lord &#346;e&#7779;a, Ananta.</div>
<div class="Purport">A <span class="Italic">karm&#299;&rsquo;s</span> material opulence and a devotee&rsquo;s material opulence are not on the same level. &#346;r&#299;la Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya comments in this way:</div>

<div class="After-Verse">By worshiping Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u one can get whatever he desires, but a pure devotee never asks Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u for any material profit. Instead he serves Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u without material desires and is therefore ultimately transferred to the spiritual kingdom. In this regard, &#346;r&#299;la V&#299;rar&#257;ghava &#256;c&#257;rya comments, <span class="Italic">yathe&#7779;&#7789;a-gatir ity artha&#7717;:</span> by worshiping Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, a devotee can get whatever he likes.

<div class="Translation">Citraketu said: O unconquerable Lord, although You cannot be conquered by anyone, You are certainly conquered by devotees who have control of the mind and senses. They can keep You under their control because You are causelessly merciful to devotees who desire no material profit from You. Indeed, You give Yourself to them, and because of this You also have full control over Your devotees.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Lord and the devotees both conquer. The Lord is conquered by the devotees, and the devotees are conquered by the Lord. Because of being conquered by one another, they both derive transcendental bliss from their relationship. The highest perfection of this mutual conquering is exhibited by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s.</span> The <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> conquered K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conquered the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s.</span> Thus whenever K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a played His flute, He conquered the minds of the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s,</span> and without seeing the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a could not be happy. Other transcendentalists, such as <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s,</span> cannot conquer the Supreme Personality of Godhead; only pure devotees can conquer Him.</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Purport">Pure devotees are described as <span class="Italic">sama-mati,</span> which means that they never deviate from devotional service under any circumstances. It is not that devotees worship the Supreme Lord only when happy; they worship Him even when in distress. Happiness and distress do not hamper the process of devotional service. Therefore <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> says that devotional service is <span class="Italic">ahaituky apratihat&#257;,</span> unmotivated and uninterrupted. When a devotee offers devotional service to the Lord without any motive (<span class="Italic">any&#257;bhil&#257;&#7779;it&#257;-&#347;&#363;nyam </I>[</span><span class="Ref_Italic"></B></I>Bhakti-ras&#257;m&#7771;ta-sindhu </span></B><PW:Popup,5.70833,2.72917,Popup><div class="Verse">any&#257;bhil&#257;&#7779;it&#257;-&#347;&#363;nya&#7745;<br>j&ntilde;&#257;na-karm&#257;dy-an&#257;v&#7771;tam<br>&#257;nuk&#363;lyena k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;&#257;nu-<br>&#347;&#299;lana&#7745; bhaktir uttam&#257;</div></div>

<div class="Normal-Level">&ldquo;<B>One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service.</B>&rdquo; <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhakti-ras&#257;m&#7771;ta-sindhu</span></B> 1.1.11<LT>1.1.11], his service cannot be hampered by any material condition (<span class="Italic">apratihat&#257;</span>). Thus a devotee who offers service in all conditions of life can conquer the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purport">A special distinction between devotees and the other transcendentalists, namely the <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s,</span> is that <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> artificially try to become one with the Supreme, whereas devotees never aspire for such an impossible accomplishment. Devotees know that their position is to be eternally servants of the Supreme Lord and never to be one with Him. Therefore they are called <span class="Italic">sama-mati</span> or <span class="Italic">jit&#257;tm&#257;.</span> They detest oneness with the Supreme. They have no lusty desires for oneness; instead, their desire is to be freed from all material hankering. Therefore they are called <span class="Italic">ni&#7779;k&#257;ma,</span> desireless. A living entity cannot exist without desires, but desires that can never be fulfilled are called <span class="Italic">k&#257;ma,</span> lusty desires. <span class="Italic">K&#257;mais tais tair h&#7771;ta j&ntilde;&#257;n&#257;&#7717;: </I>[Bg. </I></span><a href="indexda67.html?g=2640">7.20</a>] because of lusty desires, nondevotees are deprived of their intelligence. Thus they are unable to conquer the Supreme Lord, whereas devotees, being freed from such unreasonable desires, can conquer the Lord. Such devotees are also conquered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because they are pure, being free from all material desires, they fully surrender to the Supreme Lord, and therefore the Lord conquers them. Such devotees never aspire for liberation. They simply desire to serve the lotus feet of the Lord. Because they serve the Lord without desires for remuneration, they can conquer the mercy of the Lord. The Lord is by nature very merciful, and when He sees that His servant is working without desires for material profit, naturally He is conquered.</div>
<div class="Purport">Devotees are always engaged in service.</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">sa vai mana&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-pad&#257;ravindayor<br>vac&#257;&#7745;si vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha-gu&#7751;&#257;nuvar&#7751;ane</div>
</div><A NAME="83977"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">All the activities of their senses are engaged in the service of the Lord. Because of such devotion, the Lord gives Himself to His devotees as if they could use Him for any purpose they might desire. Of course, devotees have no purpose other than to serve. When a devotee fully surrenders and has no aspiration for material profit, the Lord certainly gives him all opportunities for service. This is the position of the Lord when conquered by His devotees.</div>

<div class="Translation">My dear Lord, this cosmic manifestation and its creation, maintenance and annihilation are all but Your opulences. Since Lord Brahm&#257; and the other creators are nothing but small portions of a portion of You, their partial power to create does not make them God [&#299;&#347;vara]. Their consciousness of themselves as separate Lords is therefore merely false prestige. It is not valid.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">A devotee who has fully surrendered to the lotus feet of the Lord knows very well that the creative energy of the living entities, from Lord Brahm&#257; down to the small ant, exists because the living entities are part and parcel of the Lord. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index6669.html?g=4886">15.7</a>) the Lord says, <span class="Italic">mamaiv&#257;&#7745;&#347;o j&#299;va-loke j&#299;va-bh&#363;ta&#7717; san&#257;tana&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts.&rdquo; The living entities are nothing but very small portions of the supreme spirit, like sparks of a fire. Because they are part of the Supreme, they have a creative quality in a very minute quantity.</div>
<div class="Purport">The so-called scientists of the modern materialistic world are proud because they have created modern facilities like great airplanes, but the credit for creating the airplanes should go to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, not to the scientists who have invented or created the so-called wonderful products. The first consideration is the intelligence of the scientist; one must be elevated by the dictation of the Supreme Lord, who says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a>), <span class="Italic">matta&#7717; sm&#7771;tir j&ntilde;&#257;nam apohana&#7745; ca:</span> &ldquo;From Me comes remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.&rdquo; Because the Supreme Lord, as Supersoul, sits within the core of every living entity&rsquo;s heart, the dictation by which one advances in scientific knowledge or creative faculties comes from Him. Furthermore, the ingredients to manufacture wonderful machines like airplanes are also supplied by the Lord, not by the scientists. Before the airplane was created, its ingredients already existed, having been caused by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but when the manifested creation of the airplane is ruined, the remaining debris is a problem for the so-called creators. Another example is that the West is creating many automobiles. The ingredients for these cars are supplied, of course, by the Supreme Lord, and the intelligence for the so-called creation is also supplied by the Lord. Ultimately, when the cars are demolished, the so-called creators are faced with the problem of what to do with their ingredients. The actual creator, the original creator, is the Personality of Godhead. Only in the interim does someone create something with intelligence supplied by the Lord, and later the creation again becomes a problem. Therefore the so-called creator is not to be credited with the act of creation; the only credit goes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is rightly stated herein that the credit for all the opulences of creation, maintenance and annihilation belongs to the Supreme Lord, not to the living entities.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a], who is the original person&mdash;absolute, infallible, without beginning, although expanded into unlimited forms, still the same original, the oldest, and the person always appearing as a fresh youth. Such eternal, blissful, all-knowing forms of the Lord cannot be understood even by the best Vedic scholars, but they are always manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees.&rdquo; The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no cause, for He is the cause of everything. The Lord is beyond the workings of cause and effect. He is eternally existing. In another verse the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> says, <span class="Italic">a&#7751;&#7693;&#257;ntara-stha-param&#257;&#7751;u-cay&#257;ntara-stham:</span> the Lord exists within the gigantic universe and within the atom. The descent of the Lord into the atom and the universe indicates that without His presence, nothing could factually exist. Scientists say that water is a combination of hydrogen and oxygen, but when they see a vast ocean they are puzzled about where such a quantity of hydrogen and oxygen could have come from. They think that everything evolved from chemicals, but where did the chemicals come from? That they do not know. Since the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of all causes, He can produce immense quantities of chemicals to create a situation for chemical evolution. We actually see that chemicals are produced from living entities. For example, a lemon tree produces many tons of citric acid. The citric acid is not the cause of the tree; rather, the tree is the cause of the acid. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of everything. He is the cause of the tree that produces the citric acid (<span class="Italic">b&#299;ja&#7745; m&#257;&#7745; sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;n&#257;m</span>). Devotees can see that the original potencies causing the cosmic manifestation are not in chemicals but in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for He is the cause of the chemicals.</div>
<div class="Purport">Everything is caused or manifested by the energy of the Supreme Lord, and when everything is annihilated or dissolved, the original potency enters the body of the Supreme Lord.

<div class="After-Verse">The origin of the material creation is Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, who lies in the Causal Ocean. While He sleeps in that ocean, millions of universes are generated as He exhales, and they are all annihilated when He inhales. This Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is a plenary portion of a portion of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, Govinda (<span class="Italic">yasya kal&#257;-vi&#347;e&#7779;a&#7717;</span>).

<div class="Normal-Level">Bh&#257;gavata-dharma is not a concocted sectarian belief, for it entails research to find how everything is connected with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (<span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;&#257;v&#257;syam ida&#7745; sarvam</span>). According to the Vedic injunctions, <span class="Italic">sarva&#7745; khalv ida&#7745; brahma:</span> Brahman, the Supreme, is present in everything. <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata-dharma</span> captures this presence of the Supreme. <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata-dharma</span> does not consider everything in the world to be false. Because everything emanates from the Supreme, nothing can be false; everything has some use in the service of the Supreme. For example, we are now dictating into a microphone and recording on a dictating machine, and thus we are finding how the machine can be connected to the Supreme Brahman. Since we are using this machine in the service of the Lord, it is Brahman. This is the meaning of <span class="Italic">sarva&#7745; khalv ida&#7745; brahma.</span> Everything is Brahman because everything can be used for the service of the Supreme Lord. Nothing is <span class="Italic">mithy&#257;,</span> false; everything is factual.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata-dharma</span> is called <span class="Italic">sarvotk&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;a,</span> the best of all religious systems, because those who follow <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavata-dharma</span> are not envious of anyone. Pure <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavatas,</span> pure devotees, invite everyone, without envy, to join the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement. A devotee is therefore exactly like the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">Suh&#7771;da&#7745; sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;n&#257;m:</span> he is the friend of all living entities. Therefore this is the best of all religious systems. Whereas so-called religions are meant for a particular type of person who believes in a particular way, such discrimination has no place in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, or <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavata-dharma.</span> If we scrutinize the religious systems meant for worship of demigods or anyone else but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we will find that they are full of envy and therefore impure.</div>

<div class="Translation">How can a religious system that produces envy of one&rsquo;s self and of others be beneficial for oneself and for them? What is auspicious about following such a system? What is actually to be gained? By causing pain to one&rsquo;s own self due to self-envy and by causing pain to others, one arouses Your anger and practices irreligion.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Any religious system but the process of <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavata-dharma</span>&mdash;service as an eternal servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead&mdash;is a system of envy of one&rsquo;s own self and of others. For example, there are many systems of religion in which animal sacrifices are recommended. Such animal sacrifices are inauspicious both for the performer and for the animal. Although one is sometimes permitted to sacrifice an animal before the goddess K&#257;l&#299; and eat it instead of purchasing meat from a slaughterhouse, permission to eat meat after a sacrifice in the presence of the goddess K&#257;l&#299; is not the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is simply a concession for the miserable person who will not give up eating meat. It is meant to restrict his desire for unrestricted meat-eating. Such a religious system is condemned. Therefore K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharm&#257;n parityajya m&#257;m eka&#7745; &#347;ara&#7751;a&#7745; vraja:</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="index3a32.html?g=5997">18.66</a>] &ldquo;Give up all other duties and surrender unto Me.&rdquo; That is the last word in religion.</div>
<div class="Purport">One may argue that the sacrifice of animals is recommended in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> This recommendation, however, is a restriction. Without Vedic restrictions on the purchase of meat, people will purchase meat from the market, which will be overflooded with meat shops, and slaughterhouses will increase. To restrict this, sometimes the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> say that one may eat meat after sacrificing an insignificant animal like a goat before the goddess K&#257;l&#299;. In any case, a system of religion in which animal sacrifices are recommended is inauspicious for those who perform the sacrifices and for the animals. Envious persons who perform ostentatious animal sacrifices are condemned in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index12b8.html?g=5132">16.17</a>) as follows:</div>

He said that from the very beginning of life, from the age of five, children should be instructed about <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavata-dharma</span> because the human form of life, which is very rarely obtained, is meant for understanding this subject.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata-dharma</span> means living according to the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> we find that the Supreme Lord has arranged human society in four social divisions, namely <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a, k&#7779;atriya, vai&#347;ya</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra.</span> Again, the <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> and other Vedic literatures set forth four <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;ramas,</span> which are the divisions of spiritual life. Therefore <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavata-dharma</span> means the <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> of the four social and four spiritual divisions.</div>
<div class="Purport">The members of human society who strictly follow the principles of <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavata-dharma</span> and live according to the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are called &#256;ryans or <span class="Italic">&#257;rya.</span> A civilization of &#256;ryans who strictly follow the instructions of the Lord and never deviate from those instructions is perfect. Such civilized men do not discriminate between trees, animals, human beings and other living entities. <span class="Italic">pa&#7751;&#7693;it&#257;&#7717; sama-dar&#347;ina&#7717;:</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexdc6d.html?g=1961">5.18</a>] because they are completely educated in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, they see all living beings equally. &#256;ryans do not kill even a small plant unnecessarily, not to speak of cutting trees for sense gratification. At the present moment, throughout the world, killing is prominent. Men are killing trees, they are killing animals, and they are killing other human beings also, all for sense gratification. This is not an &#256;ryan civilization. As stated here, <span class="Italic">sthira-cara-sattva-kadambe&#7779;v ap&#7771;thag-dhiya&#7717;.</span> The word <span class="Italic">ap&#7771;thag-dhiya&#7717;</span> indicates that &#256;ryans do not distinguish between lower and higher grades of life. All life should be protected. All living beings have a right to live, even the trees and plants. This is the basic principle of an &#256;ryan civilization. Apart from the lower living entities, those who have come to the platform of human civilization should be divided into a society of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as, k&#7779;atriyas, vai&#347;yas</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras.</span> The <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> should follow the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and other Vedic literatures. The criterion must be <span class="Italic">gu&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">karma.</span> In other words, one should acquire the qualities of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a, k&#7779;atriya, vai&#347;ya</span> or <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> and act accordingly. This is the civilization accepted by the &#256;ryans. Why do they accept it? They accept it because they are very much eager to satisfy K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. This is perfect civilization.</div>
<div class="Purport">&#256;ryans do not deviate from the instructions of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, nor do they have doubts about K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, but non-&#256;ryans and other demoniac people fail to follow the instructions of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> This is because they have been trained in sense gratification at the cost of all other living entities. <span class="Italic">N&#363;na&#7745; pramatta&#7717; kurute vikarma:</I> [SB </span></I><a href="index404a.html?g=42765">5.5.4</a>] their only business is to indulge in all kinds of forbidden activities for sense gratification. <span class="Italic">Yad indriya-pr&#299;taya &#257;p&#7771;&#7751;oti:</span> they deviate in this way because they want to gratify their senses. They have no other occupation or ambition. Their method of civilization is condemned in the previous verse. <span class="Italic">Ka&#7717; k&#7779;emo nija-parayo&#7717; kiy&#257;n v&#257;rtha&#7717; sva-para-druh&#257; dharme&#7751;a:</span> &ldquo;What is the meaning of a civilization that kills oneself and others?&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">This verse, therefore, advises that everyone become a member of the &#256;ryan civilization and accept the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

We are spreading the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement to try to establish a society the way that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a wants it. This is the meaning of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. We are therefore presenting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as it is and kicking out all kinds of mental concoction.

One who misinterprets <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> twisting out some meaning for his sense gratification, is a non-&#256;ryan. Therefore commentaries on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> by such persons should be immediately rejected. One should try to follow <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as it is.

<div class="First">The science of devotional service has been instructed by N&#257;rada and A&#7749;gir&#257; to Citraketu. Now, because of Citraketu&rsquo;s devotional service, he has seen the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By performing devotional service, one advances step by step, and when one is on the platform of love of Godhead (<span class="Italic">prem&#257; pumartho mah&#257;n</span>) he sees the Supreme Lord at every moment. As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> when one engages in devotional service twenty-four hours a day (<span class="Italic">te&#7779;&#257;&#7745; satata-yukt&#257;n&#257;&#7745; bhajat&#257;&#7745; pr&#299;ti-p&#363;rvakam </I>[Bg. </I></span><a href="index0c2e.html?g=3378">10.10</a>]) in accordance with the instructions of the spiritual master, his devotional service becomes more and more pleasing. Then the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is within the core of everyone&rsquo;s heart, speaks to the devotee (<span class="Italic">dad&#257;mi buddhi-yoga&#7745; ta&#7745; yena m&#257;m upay&#257;nti te</span>). Citraketu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was first instructed by his <span class="Italic">gurus,</span> A&#7749;gir&#257; and N&#257;rada, and now, having followed their instructions, he has come to the stage of seeing the Supreme Lord face to face. Therefore the Lord is now instructing him in the essence of knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purport">The essence of knowledge is that there are two kinds of <span class="Italic">vastu,</span> or substances, One is real, and the other, being illusory or temporary, is sometimes called nonfactual. One must consider these two kinds of existence. The real <span class="Italic">tattva,</span> or truth, consists of Brahman, Param&#257;tm&#257;, and Bhagav&#257;n. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="index5017.html?g=6424">1.2.11</a>):</div>

</div><A NAME="84264"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this nondual substance Brahman, Param&#257;tm&#257; or Bhagav&#257;n.&rdquo; The Absolute Truth exists eternally in three features. Therefore, Brahman, Param&#257;tm&#257; and Bhagav&#257;n combined are the substance.</div>
<div class="Purport">The categories of emanations from the nonsubstance are two&mdash;activities and forbidden activities (<span class="Italic">karma</span> and <span class="Italic">vikarma</span>). <span class="Italic">Karma</span> refers to the pious life or material activities performed during the day and the mental activities of dreams at night. These are more or less desired activities. <span class="Italic">Vikarma,</span> however, refers to illusory activities, which are something like the will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp. These are activities that have no meaning. For example, modern scientists imagine that life can be produced from chemical combinations, and they are very busy trying to prove this in laboratories throughout the world, although no one in history has been able to produce the substance of life from material combinations. Such activities are called <span class="Italic">vikarma.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">All material activities are actually illusory, and progress in illusion is simply a waste of time. These illusory activities are called <span class="Italic">ak&#257;rya,</span> and one must learn of them from the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index67e5.html?g=1577">4.17</a>):</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;The intricacies of action are very hard to understand.

<div class="Purport">Herein it is said, <span class="Italic">aha&#7745; vai sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;ni:</span> the Lord is everything (<span class="Italic">sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;ni</span>), including the living entities and the material or physical elements.

</div><A NAME="84272"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego&mdash;all together these eight comprise My separated material energies. Besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine, which consists of the living entities, who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe.&rdquo; The living entity tries to lord it over the material or physical elements, but both the physical elements and the spiritual spark are energies emanating from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Lord says, <span class="Italic">aha&#7745; vai sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;ni:</span> &ldquo;I am everything.&rdquo; Just as heat and light emanate from fire, these two energies&mdash;the physical elements and the living entities&mdash;emanate from the Supreme Lord. Therefore the Lord says, <span class="Italic">aha&#7745; vai sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;ni:</span> &ldquo;I expand the physical and spiritual categories.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">Again, the Lord, as the Supersoul, guides the living entities who are conditioned by the physical atmosphere. Therefore he is called <span class="Italic">bh&#363;t&#257;tm&#257; bh&#363;ta-bh&#257;vana&#7717;.</span> He gives the living entity the intelligence with which to improve his position so that he may return home, back to Godhead, or if he does not want to go back to Godhead, the Lord gives him the intelligence with which to improve his material position. This is confirmed by the Lord Himself in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a>). <span class="Italic">Sarvasya c&#257;ha&#7745; h&#7771;di sannivi&#7779;&#7789;o matta&#7717; sm&#7771;tir j&ntilde;&#257;nam apohana&#7745; ca:</span> &ldquo;I am seated in everyone&rsquo;s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.&rdquo; From within, the Lord gives the living being the intelligence with which to work. Therefore the previous verse said that after the Supreme Personality of Godhead endeavors, our endeavors begin. We cannot independently endeavor or act upon anything. Therefore the Lord is <span class="Italic">bh&#363;ta-bh&#257;vana&#7717;.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">Another specific feature of the knowledge given in this verse is that <span class="Italic">&#347;abda-brahma</span> is also a form of the Supreme Lord. In His eternal, blissful form, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is accepted by Arjuna as <span class="Italic">para&#7745; brahma.</span> A living entity in the conditioned stage accepts something illusory as substantial. This is called <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> or <span class="Italic">avidy&#257;</span>&mdash;ignorance. Therefore according to the Vedic knowledge, one must become a devotee, and one must then distinguish between <span class="Italic">avidy&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">vidy&#257;,</span> which are elaborately explained in the <span class="Italic">&#298;&#347;opani&#7779;ad.</span> When one is actually on the platform of <span class="Italic">vidy&#257;,</span> he can personally understand the Personality of Godhead in His forms like those of Lord R&#257;ma, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a. The Vedic knowledge is described as the breathing of the Supreme Lord, and activities begin on the basis of Vedic knowledge. Therefore the Lord says that when He endeavors or breathes, the material universes come into existence, and various activities gradually develop. The Lord says in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> <span class="Italic">pra&#7751;ava&#7717; sarva-vede&#7779;u:</span> &ldquo;I am the syllable <span class="Italic">o&#7745;</span> in all the Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras.</span>&rdquo; Vedic knowledge begins with the vibration of the transcendental sound <span class="Italic">pra&#7751;ava, o&#7745;k&#257;ra.</span> The same transcendental sound is Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare Hare/ Hare R&#257;ma, Hare R&#257;ma, R&#257;ma R&#257;ma, Hare Hare. <span class="Italic">Abhinnatv&#257;n n&#257;ma-n&#257;mino&#7717;:</span> there is no difference between the holy name of the Lord and the Lord Himself.</div>

<div class="Translation">In this world of matter, which the conditioned soul accepts as consisting of enjoyable resources, the conditioned soul expands, thinking that he is the enjoyer of the material world. Similarly, the material world expands in the living entity as a source of enjoyment. In this way they both expand, but because they are My energies, they are both pervaded by Me. As the Supreme Lord, I am the cause of these effects, and one should know that both of them rest in Me.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da philosophy sees everything as being equal in quality with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or the Supreme Brahman, and therefore sees everything as worshipable. This dangerous theory of the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da school has turned people in general toward atheism. On the strength of this theory, one thinks that he is God, but this is not a fact. As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">may&#257; tatam ida&#7745; sarva&#7745; jagad avyakta-m&#363;rtin&#257;</span>), the fact is that the entire cosmic manifestation is an expansion of the Supreme Lord&rsquo;s energies, which are manifested in the physical elements and the living entities. The living entities wrongly consider the physical elements to be resources meant for their enjoyment, and they think themselves to be the enjoyers. However, neither of them is independent; they are both energies of the Lord. The original cause for the material energy and spiritual energy is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. However, although the expansion of the Lord&rsquo;s energies is the original cause, one should not think that the Lord Himself has expanded in different ways. To condemn the theories of the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s, the Lord clearly says in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> <span class="Italic">mat-sth&#257;ni sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;ni na c&#257;ha&#7745; te&#7779;v avasthita&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;All beings are in Me, but I am not in them.&rdquo; Everything rests upon Him, and everything is but an expansion of His energies, but this does not mean that everything is as worshipable as the Lord Himself. The material expansion is temporary, but the Lord is not temporary. The living entities are parts of the Lord, but they are not the Lord Himself. The living entities in this material world are not inconceivable, but the Lord is. The theory that the Lord&rsquo;s energies, being expansions of the Lord, are as good as the Lord is mistaken.</div>

<div class="Translation">When a person is in deep sleep, he dreams and sees in himself many other objects, such as great mountains and rivers or perhaps even the entire universe, although they are far away. Sometimes when one awakens from a dream he sees that he is in a human form, lying in his bed in one place. Then he sees himself, in terms of various conditions, as belonging to a particular nationality, family and so on. All the conditions of deep sleep, dreaming and wakefulness are but energies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should always remember the original creator of these conditions, the Supreme Lord, who is unaffected by them.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">None of these conditions of the living entities&mdash;namely, deep sleep, dreaming and wakefulness&mdash;is substantial. They are simply displays of various phases of conditional life. There may be many mountains, rivers, trees, bees, tigers and snakes that are situated far away, but in a dream one may imagine them to be nearby. Similarly, as one has subtle dreams at night, when the living entity is awake he lives in gross dreams of nation, community, society, possessions, skyscrapers, bank balance, position and honor. Under the circumstances, one should know that his position is due to his contact with the material world. One is situated in different positions in various forms of life that are all but creations of the illusory energy, which works under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Supreme Lord is the ultimate actor, and the conditioned living entity should simply remember this original actor, &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. As living entities, we are being carried away by the waves of <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti,</span> or nature, which works under the Lord&rsquo;s direction (<span class="Italic">may&#257;dhyak&#7779;e&#7751;a prak&#7771;ti&#7717; s&#363;yate sa-car&#257;caram</I> [Bg. </I><a href="index652d.html?g=3075">9.10</a></I>]</I></span>).

<div class="Translation">If one&rsquo;s dreams during sleep are merely subject matters witnessed by the Supersoul, how can the living entity, who is different from the Supersoul, remember the activities of dreams? The experiences of one person cannot be understood by another. Therefore the knower of the facts, the living entity who inquires into the incidents manifested in dreams and wakefulness, is different from the circumstantial activities. That knowing factor is Brahman. In other words, the quality of knowing belongs to the living entities and to the Supreme Soul. Thus the living entity can also experience the activities of dreams and wakefulness. In both stages the knower is unchanged, but is qualitatively one with the Supreme Brahman.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In knowledge the living entity is qualitatively one with the Supreme Brahman, but the quantity of the Supreme Brahman is not the same as that of the living entity, who is part of Brahman. Because the living entity is Brahman in quality, he can remember the past activities of dreams and also know the present activities of wakefulness.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">When a living entity, thinking himself different from Me, forgets his spiritual identity of qualitative oneness with Me in eternity, knowledge and bliss, his material, conditional life begins. In other words, instead of identifying his interest with Mine, he becomes interested in his bodily expansions like his wife, children and material possessions. In this way, by the influence of his actions, one body comes from another, and after one death, another death takes place.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Generally the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers or persons influenced by M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers think themselves as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the cause of their conditional life. As stated by the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava poet Jagad&#257;nanda Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita in his <span class="Italic">Prema-vivarta:</span></div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-bahirmukha ha&ntilde;&#257; bhoga v&#257;&ntilde;ch&#257; kare<br>nika&#7789;a-stha m&#257;y&#257; t&#257;re j&#257;pa&#7789;iy&#257; dhare</div>
</div><A NAME="84350"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">As soon as a living entity forgets his constitutional position and endeavors to become one with the Supreme, his conditional life begins. The conception that the Supreme Brahman and the living entity are equal not only in quality but also in quantity is the cause of conditional life. If one forgets the difference between the Supreme Lord and the living entity, his conditional life begins. Conditional life means giving up one body to accept another and undergoing death to accept death again. The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosopher teaches the philosophy of <span class="Italic">tat tvam asi,</span> saying, &ldquo;You are the same as God.&rdquo; He forgets that <span class="Italic">tat tvam asi</span> applies in terms of the marginal position of the living entity, who is like sunshine. There is heat and light in the sun, and there is heat and light in the sunshine, and thus they are qualitatively one. But one should not forget that the sunshine rests on the sun. As the Lord says in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> <span class="Italic">brahma&#7751;o hi prati&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;ham </I>[Bg. </I></span><a href="index3746.html?g=4826">14.27</a></I><span class="Italic">]</I>:</span> &ldquo;I am the original source of Brahman.&rdquo; The sunshine is important because of the presence of the sun globe. It is not that the sun globe is important because of the all-pervasiveness of the sunshine. Forgetfulness and misunderstanding of this fact is called <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> Because of forgetfulness of one&rsquo;s constitutional position and that of the Supreme Lord, one comes into <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> or <span class="Italic">sa&#7745;s&#257;ra</span>&mdash;conditional life. In this regard, Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya says:</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The Seventeenth Chapter is summarized as follows. This chapter describes Citraketu&rsquo;s receiving the body of an <span class="Italic">asura,</span> or demon, because of joking with Lord &#346;iva.</div>
</div><A NAME="84452"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">After personally talking with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, King Citraketu enjoyed life in his airplane with the women of the Vidy&#257;dhara planet. Engaging in the congregational chanting of the glories of the Lord, he began flying his plane and traveling in outer space. One day while traveling like this, he wandered into the bowers of Sumeru Mountain, where he came upon Lord &#346;iva embracing P&#257;rvat&#299;, surrounded by an assembly of Siddhas, C&#257;ra&#7751;as and great sages. Seeing Lord &#346;iva in that situation, Citraketu laughed very loudly, but P&#257;rvat&#299; became very angry at him and cursed him. Because of this curse, Citraketu later appeared as the demon V&#7771;tr&#257;sura.</div>
</div><A NAME="84453"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Citraketu, however, was not at all afraid of P&#257;rvat&#299;&rsquo;s curse, and thus he spoke as follows: &ldquo;Everyone in human society enjoys happiness and distress according to his past deeds and in this way travels in the material world. Therefore no one is responsible for his happiness and distress. One is controlled by the influence of material nature in the material world, yet one thinks himself the doer of everything. In this material world, which is made of the external energy of the Supreme Lord, one is sometimes cursed and sometimes favored, and thus he sometimes enjoys in the upper planetary systems and sometimes suffers in the lower planets, but all these situations are the same because they are within this material world. None of these positions has any factual existence, for all of them are temporary. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate controller because the material world is created, maintained and annihilated under His control while He nonetheless remains neutral to these different transformations of the material world in time and space. The material, external energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is in charge of this material world. The Lord helps the world by creating situations for the living entities within it.&rdquo;</div>
</div><A NAME="84454"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">When Citraketu spoke in this way, all the members in the great assembly in which Lord &#346;iva and P&#257;rvat&#299; were present were astonished. Then Lord &#346;iva began speaking about the devotees of the Lord. A devotee is neutral in all conditions of life, whether in the heavenly planets or hellish planets, whether liberated from the material world or conditioned by it, and whether blessed with happiness or subjected to distress. These are all merely dualities created by the external energy. Being influenced by the external energy, the living entity accepts a gross and subtle material body, and in this illusory position he apparently suffers miseries, although everyone is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. The so-called demigods consider themselves independent lords, and in this way they are misled from understanding that all living entities are part of the Supreme. This chapter concludes by glorifying the devotee and the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

There have been many instances in which a devotee acting as a demon has been brought to the kingdom of God by the mercy of the Lord. For P&#257;rvat&#299; to be embraced by Lord &#346;iva was natural in a relationship between husband and wife; this was nothing extraordinary for Citraketu to see. Nonetheless, Citraketu laughed loudly to see Lord &#346;iva in that situation, even though he should not have done so. Thus he was eventually cursed, and this curse was the cause of his returning home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Citraketu&rsquo;s purpose in criticizing Lord &#346;iva is somewhat mysterious and cannot be understood by a common man. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura, however, has made the following observations. Lord &#346;iva, being the most exalted Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava and one of the most powerful demigods, is able to do anything he desires. Although he was externally exhibiting the behavior of a common man and not following etiquette, such actions cannot diminish his exalted position. The difficulty is that a common man, seeing Lord &#346;iva&rsquo;s behavior, might follow his example. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index8f52.html?g=1221">3.21</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">yad yad &#257;carati &#347;re&#7779;&#7789;has<br>tat tad evetaro jana&#7717;<br>sa yat pram&#257;&#7751;a&#7745; kurute<br>lokas tad anuvartate</div>
</div><A NAME="84563"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Whatever action a great man performs, common men follow. And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues.&rdquo; A common man might also criticize Lord &#346;iva, like Dak&#7779;a, who suffered the consequences for his criticism. King Citraketu desired that Lord &#346;iva cease this external behavior so that others might be saved from criticizing him and thus becoming offenders. If one thinks that Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the only perfect personality whereas the demigods, even such demigods as Lord &#346;iva, are inclined to improper social affairs, he is an offender. Considering all this, King Citraketu was somewhat harsh in his behavior with Lord &#346;iva.</div>
<div class="Purport">Lord &#346;iva, who is always deep in knowledge, could understand Citraketu&rsquo;s purpose, and therefore he was not at all angry; rather, he simply smiled and remained silent. The members of the assembly surrounding Lord &#346;iva could also understand Citraketu&rsquo;s purpose. Consequently, following the behavior of Lord &#346;iva, they did not protest; instead, following their master, they remained silent. If the members of the assembly thought that Citraketu had blasphemed Lord &#346;iva, they would certainly have left at once, blocking their ears with their hands.</div>

The difficulty was that Citraketu, having become a great devotee of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a, was somewhat proud at having achieved Lord Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a&rsquo;s favor and therefore thought that he could now criticize anyone, even Lord &#346;iva.

<div class="Translation">O impudent one, my dear son, now take birth in a low, sinful family of demons so that you will not commit such an offense again toward exalted, saintly persons in this world.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">One should be very careful not to commit offenses at the lotus feet of Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas, of whom Lord &#346;iva is the best. While instructing &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299;, &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu described an offense at the lotus feet of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava as <span class="Italic">h&#257;t&#299; m&#257;t&#257;,</span> a mad elephant. When a mad elephant enters a nice garden, it spoils the entire garden. Similarly, if one becomes like a mad elephant and commits offenses at the lotus feet of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, his entire spiritual career is halted. One should therefore be very careful not to commit offenses at the lotus feet of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava.</div>
<div class="Purport">Mother P&#257;rvat&#299; was justified in punishing Citraketu, for Citraketu impudently criticized the supreme father, Mah&#257;deva, who is the father of the living entities conditioned within this material world. The goddess Durg&#257; is called mother, and Lord &#346;iva is called father. A pure Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava should be very careful to engage in his specific duty without criticizing others. This is the safest position. Otherwise, if one tends to criticize others, he may commit the great offense of criticizing a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava.</div>
<div class="Purport">Because Citraketu was undoubtedly a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, he might have been surprised that P&#257;rvat&#299; had cursed him. Therefore the goddess P&#257;rvat&#299; addressed him as <span class="Italic">putra,</span> or son. Everyone is the son of mother Durg&#257;, but she is not an ordinary mother. As soon as there is a small discrepancy in a demon&rsquo;s behavior, mother Durg&#257; immediately punishes the demon so that he may come to his senses. This is explained by Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexd990.html?g=2586">7.14</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">daiv&#299; hy e&#7779;&#257; gu&#7751;a-may&#299;<br>mama m&#257;y&#257; duratyay&#257;<br>m&#257;m eva ye prapadyante<br>m&#257;y&#257;m et&#257;&#7745; taranti te</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it.&rdquo; To surrender to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a means to surrender to His devotees also, for no one can be a proper servant of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a unless he is a proper servant of a devotee. <span class="Italic">Ch&#257;&#7693;iy&#257; vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-sev&#257; nist&#257;ra p&#257;yeche keb&#257;:</span> without serving a servant of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, one cannot be elevated to being a servant of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself. Therefore mother P&#257;rvat&#299; spoke to Citraketu exactly like a mother who says to her naughty child, &ldquo;My dear child, I am punishing you so that you won&rsquo;t do anything like this again.&rdquo; This tendency of a mother to punish her child is found even in mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, who became the mother of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Mother Ya&#347;od&#257; punished K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a by binding Him and showing Him a stick. Thus it is the duty of a mother to chastise her beloved son, even in the case of the Supreme Lord. It is to be understood that mother Durg&#257; was justified in punishing Citraketu. This punishment was a boon to Citraketu because after taking birth as the demon V&#7771;tr&#257;sura, he was promoted directly to Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha.</div>

<div class="Translation">Citraketu said: My dear mother, with my own hands folded together I accept the curse upon me. I do not mind the curse, for happiness and distress are given by the demigods as a result of one&rsquo;s past deeds.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Since Citraketu was a devotee of the Lord, he was not at all disturbed by the curse of mother P&#257;rvat&#299;. He knew very well that one suffers or enjoys the results of one&rsquo;s past deeds as ordained by <span class="Italic">daiva-netra</span>&mdash;superior authority, or the agents of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He knew that he had not committed any offense at the lotus feet of Lord &#346;iva or the goddess P&#257;rvat&#299;, yet he had been punished, and this means that the punishment had been ordained. Thus the King did not mind it. A devotee is naturally so humble and meek that he accepts any condition of life as a blessing from the Lord. <span class="Italic">Tat te &rsquo;nukamp&#257;&#7745; susam&#299;k&#7779;am&#257;&#7751;a&#7717;</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> 10.14.8). A devotee always accepts punishment from anyone as the mercy of the Lord. If one lives in this conception of life, he sees whatever reverses occur to be due to his past misdeeds, and therefore he never accuses anyone. On the contrary, he becomes increasingly attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead because of his being purified by his suffering. Suffering, therefore, is also a process of purification.</div>
<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura says in this connection that one who has developed K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness and who exists in love with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is no longer subject to suffering and happiness under the laws of <span class="Italic">karma.</span> Indeed, he is beyond <span class="Italic">karma.</span> The <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> says, <span class="Italic">karm&#257;&#7751;i nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bh&#257;j&#257;m:</I> [Bs. </span></I>5.54</I>]</I> a devotee is free from the reactions of his <span class="Italic">karma</span> because he has taken to devotional service. This same principle is confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexee26.html?g=4817">14.26</a>). <span class="Italic">Sa gu&#7751;&#257;n samat&#299;tyait&#257;n brahma-bh&#363;y&#257;ya kalpate:</span> one who is engaged in devotional service has already been freed from the reactions of his material <span class="Italic">karma,</span> and thus he immediately becomes <span class="Italic">brahma-bh&#363;ta,</span> or transcendental. This is also expressed in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="indexc613.html?g=6514">1.2.21</a>). <span class="Italic">K&#7779;&#299;yante c&#257;sya karm&#257;&#7751;i:</span> before attaining the stage of love, one becomes free from all the results of <span class="Italic">karma.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">The Lord is very kind and affectionate toward His devotees, and therefore a devotee, in any condition, is not subjected to the results of <span class="Italic">karma.</span> A devotee never aspires for the heavenly planets. The heavenly planets, liberation and hell are nondifferent for a devotee, for he does not discriminate between different positions in the material world. A devotee is always eager to return home, back to Godhead, and remain there as the Lord&rsquo;s associate. This ambition becomes increasingly fervent in his heart, and therefore he does not care about material changes in his life. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura comments that Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Citraketu&rsquo;s being cursed by P&#257;rvat&#299; should be considered the mercy of the Lord. The Lord wanted Citraketu to return to Godhead as soon as possible, and therefore he terminated all the reactions of his past deeds. Acting through the heart of P&#257;rvat&#299;, the Lord, who is situated in everyone&rsquo;s heart, cursed Citraketu in order to end all his material reactions. Thus Citraketu became V&#7771;tr&#257;sura in his next life and returned home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation">Although the Supreme Lord is unattached to our happiness and distress according to karma, and although no one is His enemy or favorite, He creates pious and impious activities through the agency of His material potency. Thus for the continuation of the materialistic way of life He creates happiness and distress, good fortune and bad, bondage and liberation, birth and death.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate doer of everything, in His original transcendental existence He is not responsible for the happiness and distress, or bondage and liberation, of the conditioned souls. These are due to the results of the fruitive activities of the living entities within this material world. By the order of a judge, one person is released from jail, and another is imprisoned, but the judge is not responsible, for the distress and happiness of these different people is due to their own activities. Although the government is ultimately the supreme authority, the justice is administered by the departments of the government, and the government is not responsible for the individual judgments. Therefore the government is equal to all the citizens. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is neutral to everyone, but for the maintenance of law and order His supreme government has various departments, which control the activities of the living entities. Another example given in this regard is that lilies open or close because of the sunshine, and thus the bumblebees enjoy or suffer, but the sunshine and the sun globe are not responsible for the happiness and distress of the bumblebees.</div>

Just see, although you cursed the King, he was not at all afraid or sorry. Rather, he offered respect to you, called you mother and accepted your curse, thinking himself faulty. He did not say anything in retaliation. This is the excellence of a devotee. By mildly tolerating your curse, he has certainly excelled the glory of your beauty and your power to curse him.

<div class="Translation">As one mistakenly considers a flower garland to be a snake or experiences happiness and distress in a dream, so, in the material world, by a lack of careful consideration, we differentiate between happiness and distress, considering one good and the other bad.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The happiness and distress of the material world of duality are both mistaken ideas. In the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Antya</span> <a href="indexc70a-2.html?g=140570">4.176</a>) it is said:</div>

</div><A NAME="84867"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">The distinctions between happiness and distress in the material world of duality are simply mental concoctions, for the so-called happiness and distress are actually one and the same. They are like the happiness and distress in dreams. A sleeping man creates his happiness and distress by dreaming, although actually they have no existence.</div>
<div class="Purport">The other example given in this verse is that a flower garland is originally very nice, but by mistake, for want of mature knowledge, one may consider it a snake. In this connection there is a statement by Prabodh&#257;nanda Sarasvat&#299;: <span class="Italic">vi&#347;va&#7745; p&#363;r&#7751;a-sukh&#257;yate.</span> Everyone in this material world is distressed by miserable conditions, but &#346;r&#299;la Prabodh&#257;nanda Sarasvat&#299; says that this world is full of happiness. How is this possible? He answers, <span class="Italic">yat-k&#257;ru&#7751;ya-kat&#257;k&#7779;a-vaibhavavat&#257;&#7745; ta&#7745; gauram eva stuma&#7717;.</span> A devotee accepts the distress of this material world as happiness only due to the causeless mercy of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. By His personal behavior, &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu showed that He was never distressed but always happy in chanting the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra.</span> One should follow in the footsteps of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu and engage constantly in chanting the <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra</span>&mdash;Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare Hare/ Hare R&#257;ma, Hare R&#257;ma, R&#257;ma R&#257;ma, Hare Hare. Then he will never feel the distresses of the world of duality. In any condition of life one will be happy if he chants the holy name of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purport">In dreams we sometimes enjoy eating sweet rice and sometimes suffer as if one of our beloved family members had died. Because the same mind and body exist in the same material world of duality when we are awake, the so-called happiness and distress of this world are no better than the false, superficial happiness of dreams. The mind is the via medium in both dreams and wakefulness, and everything created by the mind in terms of <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;kalpa</span> and <span class="Italic">vikalpa,</span> acceptance and rejection, is called <span class="Italic">manodharma,</span> or mental concoction.</div>

This detachment is possible because of his high standard of knowledge. The speculative philosopher tries to understand that this material world is false by cultivating knowledge, but this understanding is automatically manifested in the person of a devotee, without separate endeavor. The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers may be very proud of their so-called knowledge, but because they do not understand V&#257;sudeva (<span class="Italic">v&#257;sudeva&#7717; sarvam iti</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index4112.html?g=2631">7.19</a>]), they do not understand the world of duality, which is a manifestation of V&#257;sudeva&rsquo;s external energy. Therefore, unless the so-called <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s</span> take shelter of V&#257;sudeva, their speculative knowledge is imperfect. <span class="Italic">Ye &rsquo;nye &rsquo;ravind&#257;k&#7779;a vimukta-m&#257;nina&#7717;.</span> They simply think of becoming free from the contamination of the material world, but because they do not take shelter at the lotus feet of V&#257;sudeva, their knowledge is impure.

Therefore, the Absolute Truth is easier to understand for a devotee than for <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s</span> who simply speculate to understand V&#257;sudeva.

Relationships of dearness or enmity between the Supreme Lord and the living beings are due to the intervention of the illusory energy. Because the three modes of material nature intervene between the Lord and the living beings, these different relationships appear. Actually, the living entity in his pure condition is always very near and dear to the Lord, and the Lord is dear to him. There is no question of partiality or enmity.</div>

They are always peaceful, and they are equal to everyone.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">It is said, <span class="Italic">vai&#7779;&#7751;avera kriy&#257;, mudr&#257; vij&ntilde;eha n&#257; bujhaya:</span> one should not be astonished to see the activities of exalted, liberated Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas. As one should not be misled by the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one should also not be misled by the activities of His devotees. Both the Lord and His devotees are liberated. They are on the same platform, the only difference being that the Lord is the master and the devotees are servants. Qualitatively, they are one and the same. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index90b5.html?g=3246">9.29</a>) the Lord says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">samo &rsquo;ha&#7745; sarva-bh&#363;te&#7779;u<br>na me dve&#7779;yo &rsquo;sti na priya&#7717;<br>ye bhajanti tu m&#257;&#7745; bhakty&#257;<br>mayi te te&#7779;u c&#257;py aham</div>
</div><A NAME="84935"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him.&rdquo; From this statement by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it is clear that the devotees of the Lord are always extremely dear to Him. In effect, Lord &#346;iva told P&#257;rvat&#299;, &ldquo;Both Citraketu and I are always very dear to the Supreme Lord. In other words, both he and I are on the same level as servants of the Lord. We are always friends, and sometimes we enjoy joking words between us. When Citraketu loudly laughed at my behavior, he did so on friendly terms, and therefore there was no reason to curse him.&rdquo; Thus Lord &#346;iva tried to convince his wife, P&#257;rvat&#299;, that her cursing of Citraketu was not very sensible.</div>
<div class="Purport">Here is a difference between male and female that exists even in the higher statuses of life&mdash;in fact, even between Lord &#346;iva and his wife. Lord &#346;iva could understand Citraketu very nicely, but P&#257;rvat&#299; could not. Thus even in the higher statuses of life there is a difference between the understanding of a male and that of a female. It may be clearly said that the understanding of a woman is always inferior to the understanding of a man. In the Western countries there is now agitation to the effect that man and woman should be considered equal, but from this verse it appears that woman is always less intelligent than man.</div>
<div class="Purport">It is clear that Citraketu wanted to criticize the behavior of his friend Lord &#346;iva because Lord &#346;iva was sitting with his wife on his lap. Then, too, Lord &#346;iva wanted to criticize Citraketu for externally posing as a great devotee but being interested in enjoying with the Vidy&#257;dhar&#299; women. These were all friendly jokes; there was nothing serious for which Citraketu should have been cursed by P&#257;rvat&#299;. Upon hearing the instructions of Lord &#346;iva, P&#257;rvat&#299; must have been very much ashamed for cursing Citraketu to become a demon. Mother P&#257;rvat&#299; could not appreciate Citraketu&rsquo;s position, and therefore she cursed him, but when she understood the instructions of Lord &#346;iva she was ashamed.</div>

P&#7771;&#347;ni, the wife of Aditi&rsquo;s fifth son named Savit&#257;, had three daughters&mdash;S&#257;vitr&#299;, Vy&#257;h&#7771;ti and Tray&#299;&mdash;and very exalted sons named Agnihotra, Pa&#347;u, Soma, C&#257;turm&#257;sya and the five Mah&#257;yaj&ntilde;as. Siddhi, the wife of Bhaga, had three sons, named Mahim&#257;, Vibhu and Prabhu, and she also had one daughter, whose name was &#256;&#347;&#299;. Dh&#257;t&#257; had four wives&mdash;Kuh&#363;, Sin&#299;v&#257;l&#299;, R&#257;k&#257; and Anumati&mdash;who had four sons, named S&#257;yam, Dar&#347;a, Pr&#257;ta&#7717; and P&#363;r&#7751;am&#257;sa respectively. Kriy&#257;, the wife of Vidh&#257;t&#257;, gave birth to the five Pur&#299;&#7779;yas, who are representatives of five kinds of fire-gods. Bh&#7771;gu, the mind-born son of Brahm&#257;, took his birth again from Car&#7779;a&#7751;&#299;, the wife of Varu&#7751;a, and the great sage V&#257;lm&#299;ki appeared from Varu&#7751;a&rsquo;s semen. Agastya and Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha were two sons of Varu&#7751;a and Mitra. Upon seeing the beauty of Urva&#347;&#299;, Mitra and Varu&#7751;a discharged semen, which they kept in an earthen pot. From that pot, Agastya and Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha appeared. Mitra had a wife named Revat&#299;, who gave birth to three sons&mdash;Utsarga, Ari&#7779;&#7789;a and Pippala. Aditi had twelve sons, of whom Indra was the eleventh. Indra&rsquo;s wife was named Paulom&#299; (&#346;ac&#299;dev&#299;). She gave birth to three sons&mdash;Jayanta, &#7770;&#7779;abha and M&#299;&#7693;hu&#7779;a. By His own powers, the Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared as V&#257;manadeva. From His wife, whose name was K&#299;rti, appeared a son named B&#7771;hat&#347;loka. B&#7771;hat&#347;loka&rsquo;s first son was known as Saubhaga. This is a description of the sons of Aditi. A description of &#256;ditya Urukrama, who is an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, will be offered in the Eighth Canto.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The demons born of Diti are also described in this chapter. In the dynasty of Diti appeared the great saintly devotee Prahl&#257;da and also Bali, Prahl&#257;da&rsquo;s grandson. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu and Hira&#7751;y&#257;k&#7779;a were the first sons of Diti. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu and his wife, whose name was Kay&#257;dhu, had four sons&mdash;Sa&#7745;hl&#257;da, Anuhl&#257;da, Hl&#257;da and Prahl&#257;da. They also had one daughter, whose name was Si&#7745;hik&#257;. In association with the demon Vipracit, Si&#7745;hik&#257; bore a son named R&#257;hu, whose head was severed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. K&#7771;ti, the wife of Sa&#7745;hl&#257;da, bore a son named Pa&ntilde;cajana. Hl&#257;da&rsquo;s wife, whose name was Dhamani, gave birth to two sons&mdash;V&#257;t&#257;pi and Ilvala. Ilvala put V&#257;t&#257;pi into the form of a ram and gave him to Agastya to eat. Anuhl&#257;da, in the womb of his wife, S&#363;ry&#257;, begot two sons, named B&#257;&#7779;kala and Mahi&#7779;a. Prahl&#257;da&rsquo;s son was known as Virocana, and his grandson was known as Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja had one hundred sons, of whom B&#257;&#7751;a was the eldest.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">After describing the dynasty of the &#256;dityas and the other demigods, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; describes Diti&rsquo;s sons known as the Maruts and how they were elevated to the position of demigods. Just to help Indra, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u had killed Hira&#7751;y&#257;k&#7779;a and Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu. Because of this, Diti was very envious, and she was eager to have a son who could kill Indra. By her service, she enchanted Ka&#347;yapa Muni in order to beg from him a greater son to do this. In corroboration of the Vedic injunction <span class="Italic">vidv&#257;&#7745;sam api kar&#7779;ati,</span> Ka&#347;yapa Muni was attracted to his beautiful wife and promised to grant her any request. When, however, she requested a son who would kill Indra, he condemned himself, and he advised his wife Diti to follow the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava ritualistic ceremonies to purify herself. When Diti, following the instructions of Ka&#347;yapa, engaged in devotional service, Indra could understand her purpose, and he began observing all her activities. One day, Indra had the opportunity to see her deviating from devotional service. Thus he entered her womb and cut her son into forty-nine parts. In this way the forty-nine kinds of air known as the Maruts appeared, but because Diti had performed the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava ritualistic ceremonies, all the sons became Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas.</div>

Another significant topic is that although Ka&#347;yapa Muni was a learned scholar and was advanced in spiritual consciousness, he nonetheless fell a victim to the inducement of his beautiful wife. All these questions were posed in a small number of words, and therefore &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; very much appreciated Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it&rsquo;s inquiry.</div>

<div class="Translation">A husband is the supreme demigod for a woman. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord V&#257;sudeva, the husband of the goddess of fortune, is situated in everyone&rsquo;s heart and is worshiped through the various names and forms of the demigods by fruitive workers. Similarly, a husband represents the Lord as the object of worship for a woman.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexae45.html?g=3192">9.23</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">ye &rsquo;py anya-devat&#257;-bhakt&#257;<br>yajante &#347;raddhay&#257;nvit&#257;&#7717;<br>te &rsquo;pi m&#257;m eva kaunteya<br>yajanty avidhi-p&#363;rvakam</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Whatever a man may sacrifice to other gods, O son of Kunt&#299;, is really meant for Me alone, but it is offered without true understanding.&rdquo; The demigods are various assistants who act like the hands and legs of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who is not in direct touch with the Supreme Lord and cannot conceive of the exalted position of the Lord is sometimes advised to worship the demigods as various parts of the Lord. If women, who are usually very much attached to their husbands, worship their husbands as representatives of V&#257;sudeva, the women benefit, just as Aj&#257;mila benefited by calling for N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, his son. Aj&#257;mila was concerned with his son, but because of his attachment to the name of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, he attained salvation simply by chanting that name. In India a husband is still called <span class="Italic">pati-guru,</span> the husband spiritual master. If husband and wife are attached to one another for advancement in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, their relationship of cooperation is very effective for such advancement. Although the names of Indra and Agni are sometimes uttered in the Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras</span> (<span class="Italic">indr&#257;ya sv&#257;h&#257;, agnaye sv&#257;h&#257;</span>), the Vedic sacrifices are actually performed for the satisfaction of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. As long as one is very much attached to material sense gratification, the worship of the demigods or the worship of one&rsquo;s husband is recommended.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The natural instinct of a woman is to enjoy the material world. She induces her husband to enjoy this world by satisfying his tongue, belly and genitals, which are called <span class="Italic">jihv&#257;, udara</span> and <span class="Italic">upastha.</span> A woman is expert in cooking palatable dishes so that she can easily satisfy her husband in eating. When one eats nicely, his belly is satisfied, and as soon as the belly is satisfied the genitals become strong. Especially when a man is accustomed to eating meat and drinking wine and similar passionate things, he certainly becomes sexually inclined. It should be understood that sexual inclinations are meant not for spiritual progress but for gliding down to hell. Thus Ka&#347;yapa Muni considered his situation and lamented. In other words, to be a householder is very risky unless one is trained and the wife is a follower of her husband. A husband should be trained at the very beginning of his life. <span class="Italic">Kaum&#257;ra &#257;caret pr&#257;j&ntilde;o dharm&#257;n bh&#257;gavat&#257;n iha</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="indexc835.html?g=55645">7.6.1</a>).

Then when he marries, if his wife is faithful to her husband and follows him in such life, the relationship between husband and wife is very desirable. However, a relationship between husband and wife without spiritual consciousness but strictly for sense gratification is not at all good. It is said in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (12.2.3) that especially in this age, Kali-yuga, <span class="Italic">d&#257;m-patye &rsquo;bhirucir hetu&#7717;:</span> the relationship between husband and wife will be based on sexual power.

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">A woman&rsquo;s face is as attractive and beautiful as a blossoming lotus flower during autumn. Her words are very sweet, and they give pleasure to the ear, but if we study a woman&rsquo;s heart, we can understand it to be extremely sharp, like the blade of a razor. In these circumstances, who could understand the dealings of a woman?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Woman is now depicted very well from the materialistic point of view by Ka&#347;yapa Muni. Women are generally known as the fair sex, and especially in youth, at the age of sixteen or seventeen, women are very attractive to men. Therefore a woman&rsquo;s face is compared to a blooming lotus flower in autumn. Just as a lotus is extremely beautiful in autumn, a woman at the threshold of youthful beauty is extremely attractive. In Sanskrit a woman&rsquo;s voice is called <span class="Italic">n&#257;r&#299;-svara</span> because women generally sing and their singing is very attractive. At the present moment, cinema artists, especially female singers, are especially welcome. Some of them earn fabulous amounts of money simply by singing. Therefore, as taught by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, a woman&rsquo;s singing is dangerous because it can make a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> fall a victim to the woman. <span class="Italic">Sanny&#257;sa</span> means giving up the company of women, but if a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> hears the voice of a woman and sees her beautiful face, he certainly becomes attracted and is sure to fall down. There have been many examples. Even the great sage Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra fell a victim to Menak&#257;. Therefore a person desiring to advance in spiritual consciousness must be especially careful not to see a woman&rsquo;s face or hear a woman&rsquo;s voice. To see a woman&rsquo;s face and appreciate its beauty or to hear a woman&rsquo;s voice and appreciate her singing as very nice is a subtle falldown for a <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> or <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;.</span> Thus the description of a woman&rsquo;s features by Ka&#347;yapa Muni is very instructive.</div>
<div class="Purport">When a woman&rsquo;s bodily features are attractive, when her face is beautiful and when her voice is sweet, she is naturally a trap for a man. The <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> advise that when such a woman comes to serve a man, she should be considered to be like a dark well covered by grass. In the fields there are many such wells, and a man who does not know about them drops through the grass and falls down. Thus there are many such instructions. Since the attraction of the material world is based on attraction for women, Ka&#347;yapa Muni thought, &ldquo;Under the circumstances, who can understand the heart of a woman?&rdquo; C&#257;&#7751;akya Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita has also advised, <span class="Italic">vi&#347;v&#257;so naiva kartavya&#7717; str&#299;&#7779;u r&#257;ja-kule&#7779;u ca:</span> &ldquo;There are two persons one should not trust&mdash;a politician and a woman.&rdquo; These, of course, are authoritative &#347;&#257;stric injunctions, and we should therefore be very careful in our dealings with women.</div>
<div class="Purport">Sometimes our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is criticized for mingling men and women, but K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness is meant for anyone. Whether one is a man or woman does not matter. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a personally says, <span class="Italic">striyo vai&#347;y&#257;s tath&#257; &#347;&#363;dr&#257;s te &rsquo;pi y&#257;nti par&#257;&#7745; gatim:</span> whether one is a woman, <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> or <span class="Italic">vai&#347;ya,</span> not to speak of being a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> or <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya,</span> everyone is fit to return home, back to Godhead, if he strictly follows the instructions of the spiritual master and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra.</span> We therefore request all the members of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement&mdash;both men and women&mdash;not to be attracted by bodily features but only to be attracted by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Then everything will be all right. Otherwise there will be danger.</div>

Women need to be protected by men. A woman should be cared for by her father in her childhood, by her husband in her youth and by her grown sons in her old age. This is the injunction of Manu, who says that a woman should not be given independence at any stage. Women must be cared for so that they will not be free to manifest their natural tendency for gross selfishness. There have been many cases, even in the present day, in which women have killed their husbands to take advantage of their insurance policies. This is not a criticism of women but a practical study of their nature. Such natural instincts of a woman or a man are manifested only in the bodily conception of life. When either a man or a woman is advanced in spiritual consciousness, the bodily conception of life practically vanishes. We should see all women as spiritual units (<span class="Italic">), whose only duty is to satisfy K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Then the influences of the different modes of material nature, which result from one&rsquo;s possessing a material body, will not act.</div>
<div class="Purport">The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is so beneficial that it can very easily counteract the contamination of material nature, which results from one&rsquo;s possessing a material body. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> therefore teaches, in the very beginning, that whether one is a man or a woman, one must know that he or she is not the body but a spiritual soul. Everyone should be interested in the activities of the spirit soul, not the body. As long as one is activated by the bodily conception of life, there is always the danger of being misled, whether one is a man or a woman. The soul is sometimes described as <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a</span> because whether one is dressed as a man or a woman, one is inclined to enjoy this material world. One who has this spirit of enjoyment is described as <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a.</span> Whether one is a man or a woman, he is not interested in serving others; everyone is interested in satisfying his or her own senses. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, however, provides first-class training for a man or a woman. A man should be trained to be a first-class devotee of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and a woman should be trained to be a very chaste follower of her husband. That will make the lives of both of them happy.</div>

<div class="First">Ka&#347;yapa Muni concluded, &ldquo;Diti is eager to have a son who can kill Indra, since she is a woman, after all, and is not very intelligent. I shall train her in such a way that instead of always thinking of how to kill Indra, she will become a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, a devotee of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. If she agrees to follow the rules and regulations of the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava principles, the unclean core of her heart will certainly be cleansed.&rdquo; <span class="Italic">Ceto-darpa&#7751;a-m&#257;rjanam</I> [Cc. Antya </I><a href="index0860.html?g=154712">20.12</a></I>]</I>.</span> This is the process of devotional service. Anyone can be purified by following the principles of devotional service in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness is so powerful that it can purify even the dirtiest class of men and transform them into the topmost Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu&rsquo;s movement aims at this purpose. Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura says:</div>
<div class="Centered-Verse-in-purp">vrajendra-nandana yei,     &#347;ac&#299;-suta haila sei,<br>balar&#257;ma ha-ila nit&#257;i<br>d&#299;na-h&#299;na yata chila,     hari-n&#257;me uddh&#257;rila,<br>ta&rsquo;ra s&#257;k&#7779;&#299; jag&#257;i-m&#257;dh&#257;i</div>
<div class="After-Verse">The appearance of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu in this Kali-yuga is especially meant to deliver the fallen souls, who are always planning something for material enjoyment. He gave the people of this age the advantage of being able to chant the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra</span> and thus become fully pure, free from all material contamination. Once one becomes a pure Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, he transcends all material conceptions of life. Thus Ka&#347;yapa Muni tried to transform his wife into a Vai&#7779;&#7751;av&#299; so that she might give up the idea of killing Indra. He wanted both her and her sons to be purified so that they would be fit to become pure Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas. Of course, sometimes a practitioner deviates from the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava principles, and there is a chance that he may fall down, but Ka&#347;yapa Muni thought that even if one falls while practicing the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava principles, he is still not a loser. Even a fallen Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is eligible for better results, as confirmed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> <span class="Italic">Svalpam apy asya dharmasya tr&#257;yate mahato bhay&#257;t:</span> even practicing the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava principles to a small extent can save one from the greatest danger of material existence. Thus Ka&#347;yapa Muni planned to instruct his wife Diti to become a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava because he wanted to save the life of Indra.</div>

I promise that I shall do the needful and not break the vow.&rdquo; This is another side of a woman&rsquo;s psychology. Even though a woman is very fond of fulfilling her own plans, when someone instructs her, especially her husband, she innocently follows, and thus she can be trained for better purposes. By nature a woman wants to be a follower of a man; therefore if the man is good the woman can be trained for a good purpose.</div>

Sometimes He is buried in the earth, and as if unable to come out Himself, He requests His devotee to rescue Him. Sometimes He requests His devotee to preach His glories all over the world, although He alone is quite competent to perform this task. Even though the Supreme Personality of Godhead is endowed with all possessions and is self-sufficient, He depends on His devotees. Therefore the relationship of the Lord with His devotees is extremely confidential. Only the devotee can perceive how the Lord, although full in Himself, depends on His devotee for some particular work.

Considering all these points, the most important aspect of the Supreme Lord&rsquo;s self-sufficiency is that He depends on His devotees. This is called His causeless mercy.

To keep Lak&#7779;m&#299;, or the riches of the Lord, without the service of the Lord is always dangerous, for then Lak&#7779;m&#299; becomes the illusory energy. With Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, however, Lak&#7779;m&#299; is the spiritual energy.</div>

<div class="First">In Bengal even today if a woman lives for a long time with her husband, she is considered very fortunate. A woman generally desires a good husband, good children, a good home, prosperity, opulence and so on. As recommended in this verse, a woman will receive all these desirable benedictions, and a man will also be able to receive all benedictions, from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus by performing this particular type of <span class="Italic">vrata,</span> a man and a woman in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness will be happy in this material world, and because of being K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious they will be promoted to the spiritual world.</div>

<div class="Translation">If an unmarried girl observes this vrata, she will be able to get a very good husband. If a woman who is av&#299;r&#257;&mdash;who has no husband or son&mdash;executes this ritualistic ceremony, she can be promoted to the spiritual world. A woman whose children have died after birth can get a child with a long duration of life and also become very fortunate in possessing wealth. If a woman is unfortunate she will become fortunate, and if ugly she will become beautiful. By observing this vrata, a diseased man can gain relief from his disease and have an able body with which to work. If one recites this narration while offering oblations to the pit&#257;s and demigods, especially during the &#347;r&#257;ddha ceremony, the demigods and inhabitants of Pit&#7771;loka will be extremely pleased with him and bestow upon him the fulfillment of all desires. After one performs this ritualistic ceremony, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and His wife, mother Lak&#7779;m&#299;, the goddess of fortune, are very pleased with him. O King Par&#299;k&#7779;it, now I have completely described how Diti performed this ceremony and had good children&mdash;the Maruts&mdash;and a happy life. I have tried to explain this to you as elaborately as possible.</div>
