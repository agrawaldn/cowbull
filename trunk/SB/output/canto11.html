<div class="Chapnum"> 1. The Curse Upon the Yadu Dynasty</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter gives a hint of the destruction of the Yadu dynasty, which took place owing to the appearance of an iron club. Hearing this narration is a great impetus for becoming detached from the material world. Lord Çré Kåñëa expertly arranged the great Kurukñetra battle between the Kurus and the Päëòavas and thus removed to a great extent the earth's burden. But the Supreme Lord, whose influence is inconceivable, was not yet satisfied, because of the continued presence of the undefeatable Yadu family. The Lord desired to bring about the destruction of the Yadu dynasty so that He could completely wind up His pastimes on the earth and go back to His own abode. Using the pretense of a curse by an assembly of brähmaëas, He withdrew His entire dynasty from the surface of the earth.</div>
<div class="First"> By Çré Kåñëa's desire, many great sages, headed by Närada and Viçvämitra, assembled at the holy place named Piëòäraka, near the city of Dvärakä. The young boys of the Yadu family, absorbed in a playful mood, also arrived there. These boys dressed Sämba in the guise of a pregnant woman about to give birth and inquired from the sages about the fruitfulness of Sämba's so-called pregnancy. The sages cursed the mocking boys by saying, "She will give birth to a club that will destroy your family." The Yadus, frightened by this curse, immediately lifted the garment from Sämba's abdomen and found a club. Hurrying to the assembly of Ugrasena, the King of the Yadus, they offered a report of everything that had taken place. Fearing the brähmaëas' curse, Yaduräja Ugrasena ordered the club ground to powder and thrown into the ocean. Within the ocean, a fish swallowed the last remaining lump of iron, and the waves carried all the bits of ground powder to the shore, where they were implanted and eventually grew into a grove of canes. Fishermen caught the fish, and a hunter named Jarä used the iron lump found in its belly to fashion an arrow. Although the Supersoul, Lord Çré Kåñëa, understood what was happening, He did not wish to do anything to counteract it. Rather, in the form of time He sanctioned these events.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé said: Lord Çré Kåñëa, accompanied by Balaräma and surrounded by the Yadu dynasty, executed the killing of many demons. Then, further to remove the burden of the earth, the Lord arranged for the great Battle of Kurukñetra, which suddenly erupted in violence between the Kurus and the Päëòavas.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The Eleventh Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam begins with a reference to the pastimes executed by Lord Çré Kåñëa in the Tenth Canto. The beginning of the Tenth Canto describes that when the earth was overburdened by demoniac rulers, the personified earth, Bhümi, approached Lord Brahmä with tears in her eyes, begging for relief, and Brahmä immediately went with the demigods to approach the Supreme Lord in His form of Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu. As the demigods waited respectfully on the shore of the milk ocean, the Supreme Lord announced through Brahmä that He would soon incarnate on earth and that the demigods should also descend to assist in His pastimes. Thus from the very beginning of Lord Kåñëa's appearance it was understood that He would descend to the earth to remove the demons.</div>
<div class="First"> As Çréla Prabhupäda states in his commentary to Bhagavad-gétä (16.6), those who agree to obey the injunctions of revealed scriptures are known as demigods, whereas those who defy the orders of Vedic scriptures are known as asuras, or demons. The Vedic literatures are presented within the universe for the guidance of the conditioned souls, who are trapped under the three modes of material nature and who are therefore rotating in a continuous cycle of birth and death. By strictly adhering to the Vedic injunctions, we can easily satisfy our material needs and at the same time make tangible progress on the path back home, back to Godhead. Thus we can achieve an eternal life of bliss and knowledge in the Lord's own abode simply by obeying the Lord's instructions as they are presented in Vedic literatures such as Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam. The demons, however, minimize or even mock the absolute authority of the Supreme Lord and His teachings. Because these asuras envy the sovereign status of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they minimize the importance of the Vedic scriptures, which emanate directly from the breathing of the Lord. The demons establish a society governed by their own concocted whims and inevitably create chaos and misery, especially for pious living entities who sincerely desire to follow the will of God. Lord Çré Kåñëa states in Bhagavad-gétä that when there is a predominance of such chaotic, irreligious societies on the earth, He personally descends to rectify the imbalance. Thus from the very beginning of His transcendental infancy, Kåñëa systematically killed the powerful asuras, or demons, who were an intolerable burden for the earth. Lord Çré Kåñëa was assisted by His brother, Balaräma, who is also the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although God is one, He can expand Himself to enjoy in many forms at once. That is His omnipotence. And the first such expansion is Balaräma, or Baladeva. Balaräma killed many noteworthy demons, including Dhenukäsura, Dvivida and the envious Rukmé. Kåñëa was also accompanied by the members of the Yadu dynasty, many of whom were demigods who had descended to assist the Lord. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, however, has revealed that although many demigods had taken birth in the Yadu dynasty to assist the Lord, some members of the Yadu dynasty were actually inimical toward Kåñëa. Because of their mundane vision of the Lord, they considered themselves to be on the same level as Kåñëa. Having taken birth in the family of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, they had inconceivable strength, and thus they misunderstood Kåñëa's supreme position. Having forgotten that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they would constitute a great burden, and consequently it was necessary for Kåñëa to remove them from the earth. There is a popular saying that familiarity breeds contempt. To destroy the contemptuous members of His own dynasty, the Lord caused a quarrel among them. For this purpose, He arranged for Närada and other sages to display anger against the Kärñëas, the members of His family. Although many Yadus who were devoted to Kåñëa were apparently killed in this fratricidal war, Lord Kåñëa actually returned them to their original positions as universal directors, or demigods. It is the Lord's promise in Bhagavad-gétä that He will always protect those who are favorable to His service.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, in his commentary on this verse, has given a summary of the entire Eleventh Canto as follows. Chapter One describes the beginning of the mauñala-lélä, or the prelude to the destruction of the Yadu dynasty. Chapters Two through Five describe the conversations between the nine Yogendras and King Nimi. Chapter Six describes the prayers of Brahmä, Çiva and other residents of heaven. Chapters Seven through Twenty-nine present the conversation between Kåñëa and Uddhava that is known as the Uddhava-gétä. Chapter Thirty describes the withdrawal of the Yadu dynasty from the earth. The final chapter describes the disappearance of Lord Kåñëa.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Because the sons of Päëòu were enraged by the numerous offenses of their enemies, such as duplicitous gambling, verbal insults, the seizing of Draupadé's hair, and many other cruel transgressions, the Supreme Lord engaged those Päëòavas as the immediate cause to execute His will. On the pretext of the Battle of Kurukñetra, Lord Kåñëa arranged for all the kings who were burdening the earth to assemble with their armies on opposite sides of the battlefield, and when the Lord killed them through the agency of war, the earth was relieved of its burden.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The Päëòavas were repeatedly harassed by their enemies, such as Duryodhana and Duùçäsana. As innocent young princes, the Päëòavas had no enemy, but Duryodhana was constantly plotting against his helpless cousins. The Päëòavas were sent to a house of lac, which was later burned to the ground. They were administered poison, and their chaste wife Draupadé was publicly insulted when her hair was pulled and an attempt was made to strip her naked. Throughout these dangers, Lord Çré Kåñëa constantly protected the Päëòavas, who were fully surrendered to Him and who knew no shelter other than Him.</div>
<div class="First"> In this verse the word itaretarataù is significant. Previous to the Battle of Kurukñetra, Kåñëa had personally killed many demons, including Pütanä, Keçé, Aghäsura and Kaàsa. Now, Kåñëa wanted to complete His mission of removing the earth's burden by killing the remaining impious persons. But as stated here, kåtvä nimittam: the Lord did not personally kill, but empowered His devotees Arjuna and the other Päëòavas to remove the impious kings. Thus acting personally and through His immediate expansion Balaräma, as well as by empowering His pure devotees such as the Päëòavas, Kåñëa fully displayed the pastimes of the yugävatära by reestablishing religious principles and ridding the world of demons. Although the general purpose of the Kurukñetra battle was to kill the demons, by Kåñëa's arrangement some great devotees such as Bhéñma also appeared to be inimical toward the Lord. But as described in the First Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.9.39) by the words hatä gatäù svarüpam, many great devotees played with the Lord as enemies and upon being killed by Kåñëa returned immediately to His abode in the spiritual sky in their original spiritual bodies. Because God is absolute, by His killing He simultaneously removes the demons from the earth and encourages His pure devotees.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> The Supreme Personality of Godhead used the Yadu dynasty, which was protected by His own arms, to eliminate the kings who with their armies had been the burden of this earth. Then the unfathomable Lord thought to Himself, "Although some may say that the earth's burden is now gone, in My opinion it is not yet gone, because there still remains the Yädava dynasty itself, whose strength is unbearable for the earth."</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has remarked in this regard that although ordinary people might think that the Lord had now removed the burden of the earth by killing the demons, reestablishing dharma, and so on, Lord Çré Kåñëa Himself could detect that there was further danger from the irreligious activities of His own family members who were acting improperly. It is stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam that a just king will refuse to punish his own enemy if his enemy is innocent but will punish his own son if his son actually deserves punishment. Thus although in the eyes of the world the members of the Lord's own dynasty are always worshipable, Lord Kåñëa detected that by their intimate association with Him some members of the Yadu dynasty had become indifferent to His will. Since such whimsical members of the Yadu dynasty could act freely, being relatives of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they would surely cause great misfortune for the world, and foolish persons would take such whimsical behavior to be the will of Kåñëa. Thus the Lord, whose desires are inconceivable, began to consider the need to annihilate the indifferent, contemptuous members of the Yadu family. From the viewpoint of ordinary persons, all the demons had been killed by the Supreme Lord's pastimes in Dvärakä and Mathurä, as well as by the Battle of Kurukñetra, and the earth was now free of its burden. Nevertheless, to free the earth from the remaining burden of His own puffed-up family members, Lord Çré Kåñëa transferred them away from the earth by causing a fratricidal quarrel among them. In this way He prepared for His own disappearance from the earth.</div>
<div class="First"> Çrédhara Svämé has pointed out that the word bähubhiù, "by His arms," is used in the plural (rather than the dual) to indicate that the Lord caused the destruction of the Yadu dynasty in His four-armed form. The original form of Kåñëa as Govinda is two-armed, but it was by the plenary portion of the four-armed Näräyaëa that the Lord killed all the demons on the earth and ultimately removed the burdensome members of His own family. It may be asked, If certain members of the Yadu family had become indifferent to the will of the Lord, why didn't they oppose the Lord in His plan to remove them from the earth? Therefore the word aprameyaù is used, which indicates that it is impossible for anyone, even the Lord's own family members, to understand His will completely.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has given another reason for the destruction of the Yadu dynasty. He emphasizes that the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead should never be taken to be ordinary material activities. Nor are the Lord's associates ordinary persons. Although Lord Kåñëa apparently incarnates within this world for some time and then goes away, it should be understood that the Supreme Lord is eternally situated with His entourage in His various abodes in the spiritual sky, such as Çré Gokula, Mathurä and Dvärakä. The members of the Yadu dynasty are eternal associates of the Lord, and therefore they cannot bear to be separated from the Lord. Since Kåñëa was preparing to give up His earthly pastimes, if He were to leave the Yadu dynasty on the earth they would surely become so disturbed by His absence that in their highly agitated state of mind they would trample and destroy the earth. Therefore, Kåñëa arranged the disappearance of the Yadu dynasty prior to His own disappearance.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Jéva Gosvämé concludes that ultimately the members of the Yadu dynasty are never to be considered irreligious. Vaiñëava äcäryas have mentioned that the story of the disappearance of the Yadu dynasty is especially meant to help the conditioned souls achieve liberation from the bondage of materialistic life. Within the three worlds there were none as powerful and opulent as the Yadu dynasty. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the possessor of unlimited opulences—beauty, strength, knowledge, fame and so on—and the members of the Yadu dynasty, being the personal associates of the Lord, were also endowed with inconceivable opulences. Therefore, when we see how a fratricidal war suddenly deprived the members of the Yadu dynasty of all of their earthly possessions and even their lives, we can understand that there is no permanent position within this material world. In other words, although the members of the Yadu dynasty are eternal associates of the Lord and were immediately transferred to another planet where the Lord was appearing, their sudden disappearance through fratricidal war is meant to impress upon the conditioned souls the temporary nature of this world. Therefore, the apparent indifference or enmity of certain members of the Yadu dynasty toward Kåñëa should not be taken to be actual irreligion on their part. The entire situation was arranged by Lord Kåñëa to teach a lesson to the conditioned souls. In this connection Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has cited several verses from the Bhägavatam to prove that the members of the Yadu dynasty achieved their exalted birth in the Lord's own family by innumerable pious activities and by complete absorption in thought of Lord Kåñëa. In fact it is said that in sleeping, sitting, walking and speaking, they were unable to remember their own selves, because they were simply thinking of Kåñëa. In the First Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.15.33), Çréla Prabhupäda has commented as follows on the disappearance of the Yadu dynasty: "The setting of the sun does not mean the end of the sun. It means that the sun is out of our sight. Similarly, the end of the mission of the Lord on a particular planet or universe only means that He is out of our sight. The end of the Yadu dynasty also does not mean that it is annihilated. It disappears along with the Lord, out of our sight."</div>

<div class="Translation"> Lord Kåñëa thought, "No outside force could ever bring about the defeat of this family, the Yadu dynasty, whose members have always been fully surrendered to Me and are unrestricted in their opulence. But if I inspire a quarrel within the dynasty, that quarrel will act just like a fire created from the friction of bamboo in a grove, and then I shall achieve My real purpose and return to My eternal abode."</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Even though Lord Kåñëa wanted to arrange for the disappearance of the members of the Yadu dynasty, He could not personally kill them, as He had killed many demons, because the Yadu dynasty was His own family. One might ask why Lord Kåñëa did not arrange for them to be killed by others. Therefore it is stated in this verse, naivänyataù paribhavo 'sya bhavet kathaïcit: because the Yadu dynasty was the Lord's own family, no one within the universe was capable of killing them, not even the demigods. In fact, Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura points out that no one within the universe was capable of even insulting the members of the Yadu dynasty, what to speak of defeating or killing them. The reason is given here by the words mat-saàçrayasya. The members of the Yadu dynasty had fully taken shelter of Kåñëa, and therefore they were always under the personal protection of the Lord. It is stated, märe kåñëa räkhe ke, räkhe kåñëa märe ke: If Kåñëa protects someone, no one can kill him, and if Kåñëa wants to kill someone, no one can save him. Kåñëa had originally requested all of His associates, along with the demigods, to appear on the earth to assist Him in His pastimes. Now that His pastimes were coming to an end on this particular planet and would be transferred to another planet in another universe, Kåñëa wanted to remove all of His associates from the earth so that in His absence they would not constitute a burden. Since the powerful Yadu dynasty, being the Lord's personal family and army, could not possibly be defeated by anyone, Kåñëa arranged an internal quarrel, just as the wind in a bamboo forest sometimes rubs the bamboos together and creates a fire that consumes the entire forest.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté has pointed out that ordinary people, hearing of the adventures of the Yadu family, might think that the heroes of the Yadu dynasty are as worshipable as Kåñëa or that they are independent controllers. In other words, people polluted by Mäyäväda philosophy might see the Yadu dynasty as being on the same level as Kåñëa. Therefore, to establish that even the most powerful living entity can never equal or surpass the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa arranged for the destruction of the Yadu dynasty.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has made a very important comment on this verse. He states that since the intentions of the Supreme Lord, Kåñëacandra, are always perfect, it was certainly in consideration of the greatest benefit for the entire world that He destroyed His own family on the pretext of a curse by brähmaëas. In this connection, Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has shown a parallel in the pastimes of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, who is Kåñëa Himself appearing as His own devotee.</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Caitanya appeared along with His first plenary expansion, known as Lord Nityänanda Prabhu, and with Lord Advaita Prabhu. All three personalities—Caitanya Mahäprabhu, Nityänanda Prabhu and Advaita Prabhu—are accepted by Vaiñëava äcäryas to be in the category of viñëu-tattva, the full status of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. These three Personalities of Godhead perceived that in the future Their so-called seminal descendants would get undue recognition and thus, being puffed up, would commit grave offenses against those who were actually Vaiñëava gurus or representatives of the Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> Every living being is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, as stated in the Bhagavad-gétä (mamaiväàçaù). Every living entity is originally a son of God, yet to execute His pastimes the Lord selects certain highly qualified living entities whom He allows to take birth as His personal relatives. But those living entities who appear as descendants of the Lord's personal family may undoubtedly become proud of such a position and thus abuse the great adulation they receive from ordinary people. In this way such persons may artificially get undue attention and divert people from the actual principle of spiritual advancement, which is to surrender to the pure devotee who represents the Lord. The last eight verses (85)of the Twelfth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä give a description of the pure devotees the Lord permits to act as äcäryas, or spiritual leaders of mankind. In other words, simply to take birth in the personal family of Kåñëa is not the qualification for being a spiritual master, since according to Bhagavad-gétä, pitäham asya jagataù: every living entity is eternally a member of the Lord's family. Kåñëa says in Bhagavad-gétä, samo 'haà sarva-bhüteñu na me dveñyo 'sti na priyaù: [Bg. 9.29] "I am equal to everyone. No one is My enemy, and no one is My special friend." If the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears to have a special family, such as the Yadu dynasty, such a so-called family is a special arrangement of the Lord's pastimes in order to attract the conditioned souls. When Kåñëa descends, He acts as if He were an ordinary person in order to attract the living entities to His pastimes. Therefore Kåñëa acted as though the Yadu dynasty was His personal family, although in fact every living entity is a member of His family. Ordinary people, however, not understanding the higher principles of spiritual knowledge, easily forget the actual qualifications of a bona fide spiritual master and instead give undue importance to people born in the Lord's so-called family. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, therefore, avoided this impediment on the path of spiritual enlightenment by leaving behind no children. Although Caitanya Mahäprabhu married twice, He was childless. Nityänanda Prabhu, who is also the Supreme Personality of Godhead, did not accept any of the natural sons born of His own son, Çré Vérabhadra. Similarly, Lord Advaita Äcärya divested of His association all of His sons except Acyutänanda and two others. Acyutänanda, the chief faithful son of Advaita Äcärya, had no seminal progeny, and the remaining three of the six sons of Lord Advaita fell from the path of devotion to the Lord and are known as rejected sons. In other words, the appearance of Caitanya Mahäprabhu allowed little facility for continuing a so-called seminal family to create confusion. The respect shown to the conception of seminal lineage in deference to the ideas of the smärtas is unfit to be accepted by one who actually understands the supreme truth from Vedic authority. Other äcäryas, or spiritual masters, have also demonstrated this point in their own families. His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda, our own beloved spiritual master, who is the mighty author of this Çrémad-Bhägavatam series, was born in a family of pure devotees, and he himself exhibited all the symptoms of pure devotional service from his very childhood. Çréla Prabhupäda eventually came to the Western countries and exhibited unprecedented spiritual potency in establishing the Kåñëa consciousness movement all over the world. In a few short years, he translated more than fifty large volumes of Vedic philosophy. By his practical activities he is certainly understood to be a most empowered representative of the Lord. Nonetheless, his own family members, although devotees of Kåñëa, did not at all come up to the proper standard of devotional service and are therefore not given attention by the members of ISKCON. The natural tendency for the members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness would be to offer all reverence and worship to the members of Çréla Prabhupäda's immediate family. But since by Kåñëa's arrangement these family members are not at all on the platform of pure devotional service, the members of ISKCON give them hardly any attention but instead worship those who actually exhibit the qualities of highly advanced Vaiñëavas, regardless of their so-called birth. In other words, birth cannot constitute the qualification for a respectable person, even when one is born in the Lord's own family or in the äcärya's family, what to speak of an ordinary wealthy or learned family. In India there is a class of men known as nityänanda-vaàça, who claim to be direct descendants of Lord Nityänanda and therefore worthy of the highest respect for their position in devotional service. In this regard, Çréla Prabhupäda has written in The Nectar of Devotion, "In the Middle Ages, after the disappearance of Lord Caitanya's great associate Lord Nityänanda, a class of priestly persons claimed to be the descendants of Nityänanda, calling themselves the gosvämé caste. They further claimed that the practice and spreading of devotional service belonged only to their particular class, which was known as nityänanda-vaàça. In this way they exercised their artificial power for some time, until Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, the powerful äcärya of the Gauòéya Vaiñëava sampradäya, completely smashed their idea. There was a great hard struggle for some time, but it has turned out successful, and it is now correctly and practically established that devotional service is not restricted to a particular class of men. Besides that, anyone who is engaged in devotional service is already a high-class brähmaëa. So Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura's struggle for this movement has come out successful. It is on the basis of his position that anyone, from any part of the universe, can become a Gauòéya Vaiñëava."</div>
<div class="First"> In other words, the essence of spiritual knowledge is that every living being, regardless of his present status in life, is originally a servant of the Supreme Lord, and it is the mission of the Lord to reclaim all of these fallen living entities. Despite his past situation, any living being who is willing to surrender again at the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord or His bona fide representative can purify himself by strictly adhering to the rules and regulations of bhakti-yoga and thus act as a high-class brähmaëa. Nonetheless, the seminal descendants of the Lord think themselves to have acquired their ancestor's character and position. Thus the Supreme Lord, who is the well-wisher of the entire universe and especially of His devotees, bewilders the discriminatory power of His own descendants in such a contradictory way that these seminal descendants become recognized as deviant and the actual qualification to be a representative of the Lord, namely unalloyed surrender to the will of Kåñëa, remains prominent.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is the reservoir of all beauty. All beautiful things emanate from Him, and His personal form is so attractive that it steals the eyes away from all other objects, which then seem devoid of beauty in comparison to Him. When Lord Kåñëa was on the earth, He attracted the eyes of all people. When Kåñëa spoke, His words attracted the minds of all who remembered them. By seeing the footsteps of Lord Kåñëa, people became attracted to Him, and thus they wanted to offer their bodily activities to the Lord as His followers. In this way Kåñëa very easily spread His glories, which are sung throughout the world by the most sublime and essential Vedic verses. Lord Kåñëa considered that simply by hearing and chanting those glories, conditioned souls born in the future would cross beyond the darkness of ignorance. Being satisfied with this arrangement, He left for His desired destination.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çrédhara Svämé, these two verses indicate that Lord Kåñëa, having achieved all the purposes for which He had descended, went back to His spiritual kingdom. It is natural that people in the material world hanker to see a beautiful object. In materialistic life, however, our consciousness is polluted by the influence of the three modes of nature, and therefore we hanker for material objects of beauty and pleasure. The materialistic process of sense gratification is imperfect, because the laws of material nature will not allow us to be happy or satisfied in materialistic life. The living entity is constitutionally an eternal servant of God and is meant to appreciate the infinite beauty and pleasure of the Supreme Lord. Lord Kåñëa is the Absolute Truth and the reservoir of all beauty and pleasure. By serving Kåñëa we can also share in His ocean of beauty and pleasure, and thus our desire to see beautiful things and enjoy life will be fully satisfied. The example is given that the hand cannot enjoy food independently but can assimilate it indirectly by giving it to the stomach. Similarly, by serving Lord Kåñëa the living entity, who is part and parcel of the Lord, will derive unlimited happiness. The inconceivable Supreme Lord, Çré Kåñëa, by displaying His own true form, freed the living entities from falsely seeking forms of beauty other than His form, which is itself the source of all beautiful things. Simply by seeing His lotus feet, fortunate living beings could distinguish between the ungodly endeavors of the karmés, who seek gross enjoyment for their own sense gratification, and the practice of dovetailing one's activities with the service of the Lord. Although philosophers perpetually speculate about the nature of God, Lord Kåñëa directly liberated the jéva souls from all speculative misunderstandings about Him by displaying His actual transcendental form and activities. Superficially, Kåñëa's personal form, words and activities resemble those of ordinary conditioned souls. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura explains that this apparent resemblance between the Lord's activities and those of the living entities is a merciful concession by the Lord so that the conditioned souls will be attracted to Him and become eligible to return to His kingdom for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge. By showing His own spiritual form and kingdom to the living entities in a way tangible for them, Lord Kåñëa drove away their false enjoying attitude and removed their long-standing indifference to His personality. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, if one can understand the position of Çré Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one will never again fall into the network of material illusion. Such a falldown can be avoided if one constantly hears about the unique transcendental form and beauty of the Lord from authorized Vedic literatures. As explained in Bhagavad-gétä (2.42-43):</div>

<div class="First"> "Men of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of the Vedas, which recommend various fruitive activities for elevation to heavenly planets, resultant good birth, power, and so forth. Being desirous of sense gratification and opulent life, they say that there is nothing more than this." On the other hand, certain parts of Vedic literature are specifically meant to award material sense gratification to the conditioned soul and at the same time gradually condition him to obey the Vedic injunctions. The portions of the Vedas that recommend fruitive activities for regulated sense gratification are themselves dangerous, because the living being who engages in such activities becomes easily entangled in the material enjoyment offered and neglects the ultimate purpose of the Vedas. The ultimate purpose of Vedic literature is to bring the living entity back to his original consciousness, in which he acts as an eternal servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By rendering service to the Lord, the living entity can enjoy unlimited spiritual bliss in the association of the Lord in His own kingdom. Thus, one who seriously desires to advance in Kåñëa consciousness should specifically hear the Vedic literature that deals with pure devotional service to the Lord. One should hear from those who are highly advanced in Kåñëa consciousness and avoid interpretations that stimulate materialistic desires for enjoyment. When the tiny living entity is finally able to see the difference between the temporary affairs of this world and the transcendental activities of Lord Trivikrama, Kåñëa, he devotes himself to the Lord and removes from his heart the dark covering of matter, no longer desiring sense gratification, which is enjoyed under the two headings sin and piety. In other words, although people within this world are considered sinful or pious, on the material platform both sin and piety are performed for one's personal gratification. If one can understand that his real happiness lies in giving pleasure to Kåñëa, Lord Kåñëa takes such a fortunate living being back to His own abode, which is called Goloka Våndävana. According to Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, the Lord first gives a sincere soul the opportunity to hear about His pastimes. When the devotee has advanced in his spontaneous attraction to such narrations, the Lord gives him the opportunity to take part in His spiritual pastimes as they appear within this world. By taking part in the pastimes of the Lord within a particular universe, the living being becomes completely detached from the material world, and ultimately the Lord brings him to His personal abode in the spiritual sky.</div>
<div class="First"> Foolish people cannot understand this substantial benefit offered by the Lord, but Lord Kåñëa acts for the benefit of such foolish people by saving them from their absorption in the temporary world of false enjoyment. The Lord does this by personally displaying His own superlative transcendental beauty, transcendental words and transcendental activities. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has pointed out that the words tamo 'nayä tariñyanti indicate that although Lord Kåñëa appeared five thousand years ago, one who hears and chants about the activities, form and words of the Lord will get exactly the same benefit as those who personally experienced these things as contemporaries of Lord Kåñëa. In other words, he will also cross over the darkness of material existence and achieve the Lord's abode. Thus Çréla Jéva Gosvämé concludes that if such an exalted destination is available to all living beings, it must certainly have been awarded to the Yädavas, who were personal associates of the Lord. It is stated in this verse that by His beauty Kåñëa stole away the vision of people who saw Him. Kåñëa's speaking was so attractive that those who heard Him became speechless. Since generally those who cannot speak are also deaf, the Lord's words also stole away the ears of those who heard Him, since they were no longer interested in hearing sounds other than the Lord's speaking. By displaying the beauty of His footsteps, Kåñëa stole away from those who saw them the power to perform materialistic activities. Thus by His appearance in this world Kåñëa took away the senses of mankind. In other words, He made people blind, dumb, deaf, mad and otherwise invalid. Therefore Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura asks, "Since He took away everything people possessed, who would properly call Him merciful? Rather, He is just a thief." In this way, he indirectly offers the highest praise to the beauty of the Lord. Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura also points out that although Kåñëa gave liberation to the demons by destroying them, to those who were attracted to Him, Kåñëa gave pure love of God and drowned them in the ocean of His own beauty. Thus Kåñëa is not like a person who gives charity without discrimination. And Kåñëa is so merciful that not only did He give the highest benediction to the inhabitants of the earth, but He empowered great saintly persons such as Vyäsadeva to describe His pastimes with beautiful poetic verses. Thus people born on the earth in the future could easily cross over the ocean of birth and death by those glories, which are compared to a strong boat. In fact, those of us who are now enjoying the glories of Kåñëa through the transparent medium of the Bhaktivedanta purports to Çrémad-Bhägavatam, by the mercy of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda, are the fortunate recipients of the mercy of Kåñëa, who was merciful even to persons yet to be born. Quoting from the Amara-koça dictionary, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté has also stated, padaà vyavasita-träëa-sthäna-lakñmy-aìghri-vastuñu: the possible definitions for padam are "that which has been decided," "place of deliverance," "fortune," "foot" or "object." Thus he translates the word padam as also meaning vyavasita, "that which has been decided." In other words, the statement agät svam padam éçvaraù indicates not only that Kåñëa went to His abode, but that Kåñëa realized His determined desire. If we say that Kåñëa returned to His eternal abode, we imply that Kåñëa had been absent from His abode and was now returning. Therefore, Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura points out that it is incorrect to say in a normal sense that Kåñëa "went back to His abode." According to the Brahma-saàhitä, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is always present in His eternal abode in the spiritual sky. Yet by His causeless mercy He also manifests Himself from time to time within the material world. In other words, God is all-pervading. Even when present before us He is simultaneously in His abode. The ordinary soul, or jéva, is not all-pervading like the Supersoul, and therefore by his presence in the material world he is absent from the spiritual world. In fact, we are suffering due to that absence from the spiritual world, or Vaikuëöha. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, is all-pervading, and therefore Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura translates the words agät svaà padam to mean that Kåñëa achieved exactly what He desired. The Lord is all-pervading and self-sufficient in fulfilling His perfect desires. His appearance and disappearance in this world should never be compared to ordinary material activities. Viçvanätha Cakravarté has quoted a statement by Uddhava at the beginning of the Third Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (3.2.7) wherein Uddhava compares the disappearance of Lord Kåñëa to the setting of the sun. In his purport to this verse, Çréla Prabhupäda has written, "The comparison of Kåñëa to the sun is very appropriate. As soon as the sun sets, darkness automatically appears. But the darkness experienced by the common man does not affect the sun itself either at the time of sunrise or at sunset. Lord Kåñëa's appearance and disappearance are exactly like that of the sun. He appears and disappears in innumerable universes, and as long as He is present in a particular universe there is all transcendental light in that universe, but the universe from which He passes away is put into darkness. His pastimes, however, are everlasting. The Lord is always present in some universe, just as the sun is present in either the eastern or western hemisphere. The sun is always present either in India or America, but when the sun is present in India the American land is in darkness, and when the sun is present in America the Indian hemisphere is in darkness."</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has quoted a verse from the end of the Eleventh Canto that further clarifies that the abode of the Lord is as eternal as the Lord Himself: "The ocean immediately swallowed Dvärakä, O Mahäräja, taking away the Lord's personal abode, which the Lord had abandoned. The Supreme Lord, Madhusüdana, is always present in Dvärakä, which merely by being remembered takes away everything unfavorable. It is the most auspicious of auspicious places." (SB 11.31.23-24) Just as the sun appears to be swallowed by the night, Kåñëa or His abode or His dynasty seems to disappear, but actually the Lord and all of His paraphernalia, including His abode and dynasty, are eternal, in the same way as the sun is always in the sky. Çréla Prabhupäda says in this connection, "As the sun appears in the morning and gradually rises to the meridian and then again sets in one hemisphere while simultaneously rising in the other, so Lord Kåñëa's disappearance in one universe and the beginning of His different pastimes in another take place simultaneously. As soon as one pastime is finished here, it is manifested in another universe. And thus His nitya-lélä, or eternal pastimes, are going on without ending."</div>

<div class="Translation"> King Parékñit inquired: How could the brähmaëas curse the Våñëis, who were always respectful to the brähmaëas, charitable, and inclined to serve senior and exalted personalities and whose minds were always fully absorbed in thought of Lord Kåñëa?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Brähmaëas generally become angry at persons who disrespect the brahminical class, who are uncharitable and who decline to serve senior, respectable personalities. The Våñëis, however, were not like that, and thus they are described here by King Parékñit as brahmaëyänäm, or sincere followers of brahminical culture. Further, even if the brähmaëas became angry, why would they curse members of Kåñëa's own family? Since the brähmaëas were well learned, they must have known that it is offensive to oppose personal associates of the Supreme Lord. The Yadu dynasty is specifically described here as våñnénäm and kåñëa-cetasäm. In other words, they were Lord Kåñëa's own men, and they were always absorbed in thinking of Kåñëa. Therefore, even if somehow or other the brähmaëas had cursed them, how could that curse have had any effect? These are the questions of Parékñit Mahäräja. Although the Våñëis are described in this verse as kåñëa-cetasäm, always absorbed in thinking of Kåñëa, it is clearly indicated that Kåñëa desired that the brähmaëas become angry and curse the Yadu dynasty. The Supreme Lord desired to remove His personal dynasty from the earth, and therefore uncustomary offensive behavior was exhibited by the young boys of Kåñëa's own family.</div>
<div class="First"> It is to be understood from this incident that when a man displays envy and ridicule of devotees of Viñëu, his brahmaëyatä, or high spiritual qualifications, along with his reverence for Çré Kåñëa, are all destroyed. Contempt and ridicule directed toward respectable persons and true brähmaëas vanquish all good qualities. If there is a break in etiquette toward His devotees, the Supreme Lord will become ill-disposed even to His own relatives and friends and thus arrange to destroy those who oppose His devotees. If foolish persons in the guise of members of Kåñëa's personal family express enmity toward Vaiñëavas, such offenders cannot properly be called offspring of Lord Kåñëa's dynasty. That is the supreme equality of the Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> This verse answers Parékñit Mahäräja's question as to how the powerful members of the Yadu dynasty could be cursed by the brähmaëas and thus destroy themselves in a fratricidal war. By the words saàhartum aicchata kulam it is clearly stated that Lord Kåñëa Himself desired to withdraw His dynasty and therefore engaged the brähmaëas as His agent. Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura remarks here that Kåñëa had clearly demonstrated the insurpassable beauty and strength of His personal form, pastimes and pleasures to all the residents of the earth. Thus His incarnation to kill the demons, save the devotees and reestablish religious principles had been completely successful. When Lord Kåñëa noticed that His mission was now complete, everything having been done perfectly, He desired to return to His transcendental abode, along with the Våñëis. Thus the Lord personally arranged for the Yadu dynasty to be cursed by the brähmaëas.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, äpta-kämaù means that Kåñëa is always self-satisfied, and yet in order to execute His transcendental pastimes He arranged to destroy His own dynasty for three specific purposes, namely, to reestablish in the heavenly planets those demigods who had taken birth among the Yadus to assist Him, to reestablish His plenary Viñëu expansions in Their abodes, such as Vaikuëöha, Çvetadvépa and Badarikäçrama, and to remove Himself from the vision of the material world, along with His eternal associates.</div>
<div class="First"> In this connection, Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté has made several important remarks about the destruction of the Yadu dynasty. He states that many so-called religious persons have fallen down by committing the second offense against chanting the holy name, namely viñëau sarveçvareçe tad-itara-sama-dhéù, considering another living entity to be equal to Lord Viñëu, who is the Lord of lords. One who is captured by the impersonal tendency of Mäyäväda philosophy falsely thinks that the external, material energy of the Lord is equal to His internal, spiritual potency. In this way, one equates ordinary living entities with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, taking Kåñëa to be another aspect of mäyä. This is a most unfortunate misconception, for it spoils one's opportunity to understand God as He actually is.</div>
<div class="First"> Persons inclined toward this illusory conception of life would undoubtedly consider the members of the Yadu dynasty equal in all respects to Kåñëa and worship the future descendants of Kåñëa's family as being equal to Kåñëa Himself. Thus the continued presence of the Yadu dynasty on the earth would certainly constitute a great impediment on the path of spiritual understanding and a great burden on the earth. To counteract the danger to the world from the offense of equating Viñëu with the family of Viñëu, the Lord decided to crush the Yadu family.</div>
<div class="First"> The Supreme Lord, Çré Kåñëa, is always affectionate to His devotees, but whenever the familial descendants of Lord Kåñëa become inimical or indifferent to Him, not loving His pure devotees or making friendship with His servants, such so-called family members of the Lord become impediments to His will. There is a tangible danger that ignorant living beings will worship such inimical persons, revering them as close associates of Kåñëa. For example, to consider Kaàsa the maternal uncle of Kåñëa and therefore a faithful servant of Kåñëa would be a completely erroneous conclusion. By such a misconception, evil men who oppose the Lord may be accepted as His intimate associates, and persons inimical to Kåñëa may be thought of as His surrendered dependents appearing in His own family. The purpose of the destruction of the Yadu dynasty was to eradicate the false logic of the Mäyävädés who desire to see everything as one in all respects and who therefore improperly reason that the enemies of Kåñëa's devotees can be His intimate family members.</div>

The sages duly executed these rituals in the home of the chief of the Yadus, Vasudeva, the father of Lord Kåñëa. After Lord Kåñëa, who was staying in Vasudeva's house as time personified, respectfully sent the sages off at the conclusion of the ceremonies, they went to the holy place called Piëòäraka.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In this verse, Çukadeva Gosvämé begins to narrate the story of the brahminical curse that arose against the Yadu dynasty by the Lord's desire. According to Çrédhara Svämé, certain religious rituals, such as the açvamedha-yajïa, generate pious reactions. On the other hand, activities such as caring for one's children give immediate pleasure in the present only, whereas rituals performed as atonement take away sinful reactions. But the religious activities mentioned in verse 11, which are indicated by the words karmäëi puëya-nivahäni su-maìgaläni gäyaj-jagat-kali-maläpaharäëi, were pious in all respects. They produced abundant pious results and great joy and were so potent that merely glorifying these rituals relieves one from all the sinful reactions of Kali-yuga.</div>
<div class="First"> The sages called to Vasudeva's house to perform such auspicious religious activities were satisfied with proper gifts and then sent by Kåñëa to Piëòäraka, a nearby holy place situated about two miles from the Arabian Sea on the coast of Gujarat. Its current name is still Piëòäraka. Significantly, Lord Kåñëa is mentioned here as kälätmanä, the form of time, or the Supersoul. In the Eleventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä the Supreme Personality of Godhead reveals Himself to Arjuna as time personified, appearing on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra to destroy all the kings and armies who constitute a burden to the earth. Similarly, kälätmanä nivasatä yadu-deva-gehe: Kåñëa was staying in the home of His father Vasudeva as time personified, thus indicating that the time was approaching for the destruction of His own dynasty according to His desire.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> To that holy place, the young boys of the Yadu dynasty had brought Sämba, son of Jämbavaté, dressed in woman's garb. Playfully approaching the great sages gathered there, the boys grabbed hold of the sages' feet and impudently asked them with feigned humility, "O learned brähmaëas, this black-eyed pregnant woman has something to ask you. She is too embarrassed to inquire for herself. She is just about to give birth and is very desirous of having a son. Since all of you are great sages with infallible vision, please tell us whether her child will be a boy or a girl."</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté has made the following comment: "The impudent behavior of the young Yadus toward the sages headed by Närada, who were all brähmaëas and devotees of the Lord, was a display of deviation from the path of Lord Kåñëa. Similarly, although the präkåta-sahajiyäs think of themselves as intimate associates of Kåñëa, the supremely merciful Lord's determination is perfectly correct in working to finish such false devotees. Such impostors actually never accept real service to Kåñëa. The yadu-kumäras' deception is termed 'seemingly humble,' meaning that in fact they were anything but humble. Therefore, the ridiculing of Vaiñëavas by the Lord's family resulted in a great offense against the devotees of the Lord." A similar incident occurred during the pastimes of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu when His own mother offended Çré Advaita Äcärya. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu personally rectified this offense against a great Vaiñëava, and thus the Lord showed His magnanimity. Lord Kåñëa's pastime of destroying the Yadu dynasty is also a demonstration of His mercy to His devotees. Believing the brähmaëas, Vaiñëavas and åñis to be foolishly lacking knowledge in material affairs of sense gratification, the yadu-kumäras dressed Sämba, the son of Jämbavaté, as a woman and tried to mock the saintly assembly. Lord Kåñëa wanted to teach that such an offense committed against great devotees by His associate Sämba would be the cause of the Yadu dynasty's destruction, all as part of His lélä.</div>
<div class="First"> In modern times such misbehavior has also manifested itself within the Gauòéya Vaiñëava community. Unauthorized persons have initiated the process of deceitfully bestowing a woman's dress on their followers. This process is to be counted as a variety of aparädha, or offense against Kåñëa. Such an attempt to cheapen and ridicule devotional service to Kåñëa is certainly caused by envy toward the real Vaiñëavas, who are faithfully engaged in devotional service according to the rules and regulations of the Vedic literature. Thus Rüpa Gosvämé has said:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">çruti-småti-puräëädipaïcarätra-</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">vidhià vinä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">aikäntiké harer bhaktir</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">utpätäyaiva kalpate</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">[Brs. 1.2.101(86)]</div>
<div class="First"> "If one wants to demonstrate his great devotion to the Supreme Lord but his process of devotional service violates the standard rules of revealed scriptures such as çruti, småti, Puräëas and Närada-païcarätra, then his alleged love of Godhead will simply disturb society by misleading people from the auspicious path of spiritual advancement." (Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 1.2.101) The taking of a woman's clothing by a man in kåñëa-lélä was intended to point out this fact. Such an act amounts to cheating and ridicule of the devotees of Kåñëa. Sämba is a personal associate of the Lord, but acting as a harbinger of the future misfortune to be created in Kali-yuga by bogus followers of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, Sämba displayed this didactic pastime to help the living entities be blessed on the correct path of devotional service. The boys said to the sages, "O åñis, O brähmaëas, O Närada and other great personalities, can you tell us whether it will be a son or a daughter that will be born from this pregnant woman's womb?" By addressing pure Vaiñëavas in this way, they anticipated the fraudulent sampradäyas of the modern age in their practice of sakhé-bheka, or dressing men as female associates of the gopés. This unauthorized activity constitutes contempt and mockery of the pure devotees of the Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> Many false yogés, imagining they are distributing first-class devotion on the liberated platform, attempt to award the status of "pure devotee" to candidates totally ignorant of the transcendental tastes of madhura-rati, or the Lord's conjugal love in the spiritual world. Even though they know that the general populace is unfit to imitate the liberated associates of the Lord, they artificially decorate ordinary persons with the ornaments of spiritual perfection, such as tears, a melted heart, and the standing on end of the bodily hairs. Thus these bogus yogés introduce a process that misleads the world. Because Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu understood that the great misfortune caused by such false yogés, or kuyogés, was impossible to forestall in the Kali-yuga, He infected them with insane desires for material objects of lust so that ordinary persons can easily identify such false yogés as deviated from the path of pure devotional service. The mockery of the brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas by the young boys of the Yadu dynasty who dressed Sämba in woman's garb, and the resultant destruction of the Yadu dynasty, conclusively demonstrate the uselessness of the sahajiyä-sampradäyas.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has confirmed that the lack of humility shown by the sons of the Yadu dynasty was an arrangement by the Lord Himself. In other words, the members of the Yadu dynasty are ultimately associates of Lord Kåñëa, and to facilitate the instructive pastimes of the Lord they acted in apparently unethical ways.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Thus ridiculed by deceit, the sages became angry, O King, and told the boys, "Fools! She will bear you an iron club that will destroy your entire dynasty."</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The four defects of the conditioned soul, namely the tendency to commit mistakes (bhrama), illusion (pramäda), imperfect senses (karaëäpäöava) and the tendency to cheat (vipralipsä), are not found in pure devotees of the Lord. Lord Kåñëa, however, arranged for the young members of His own family, the Yadu dynasty, to exhibit the dangerous lower propensities of mankind. Thus the Yädava boys imitated the activities of the followers of a pseudodevotional cult.</div>
<div class="First"> Just before His disappearance, Kåñëa desired that the sages become angry at the young members of the Yadu dynasty, in order to teach that Vaiñëavas cannot be thought of as foolish, ignorant or mundane and to reduce the false pride of His own family members. Sometimes misguided persons assume the roles of pseudodevotees and blaspheme the actual process of pure devotional service and the pure devotees who are surrendered to preaching the mission of the Lord. Such foolish pseudodevotees think that their hatred or envy of the actual preaching mission of the Lord constitutes bhakti, but in fact it constitutes the cause of all trouble both for them and for the unfortunate people who follow them. The preachers of pure devotional service expose the pernicious attempts of pseudodevotees, and similarly the sages headed by Närada, who were all exalted devotees of the Lord, addressed the young boys of the Yadu dynasty as bewildered fools and told them, "Within this false womb or false dress of a sädhu, a club will take birth that will be the source of your dynasty's destruction."</div>
<div class="First"> Especially in India, but now also in the Western countries, there is a class of polluted sense enjoyers who also call themselves Gauòéya Vaiñëavas and pretend to exhibit the highest state of prema-bhakti. They declare that they are on the highest stage of devotion and therefore concerned only with the most intimate affairs of mädhurya-lélä, as exhibited in Våndävana. Sometimes they even dress as gopés, making a false show of entering into the pastimes of Kåñëa without actually following the standard regulations. In the name of prema-bhakti, they sometimes commit grievous offenses against the pure devotees of Kåñëa. By this incident concerning the iron club from the so-called womb of Sämba, Lord Kåñëa Himself taught the dangerous results of such pseudodevotion.</div>

This example shows that in a polluted society the club of duplicity can never bring the peace found in the society of devotees. Rather, such duplicity smashes all the nondevotional activities and whimsical doctrines of the pseudodevotees. The Yadu boys were wary about jeopardizing their advanced position and indeed had been thinking that as long as they kept their trickery concealed, others would never be able to detect such sophisticated cheating. Nonetheless, they were unable to protect their family from the reaction of their grievous offense against the devotees of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Knowing fully the significance of all these events, the Supreme Lord, though capable of reversing the brähmaëas' curse, did not wish to do so. Rather, in His form of time, He gladly sanctioned the events.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Ordinary persons may be surprised or bewildered that the Lord gladly sanctioned the cursing and destruction of His own dynasty. The word anvamodata used here indicates taking pleasure in something, or giving sanction or approval. It is also mentioned, käla-rüpé: Kåñëa gladly gave His sanction to the brähmaëas' curse in the form of time. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Prabhupäda has commented that the Supreme Lord, Kåñëacandra, decided to maintain the curse intact in order to protect the actual principles of religion and destroy the unbecoming offense of the deceitful members of the Kärñëa dynasty. It is clearly explained in Bhagavad-gétä that the whole purpose of the Lord's descent into the material world is to reestablish the authentic principles of religion by which the conditioned souls who are suffering intensely under the laws of material nature can regain their original existential status as eternally liberated servants of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. The living entity comes to this material world with a desire to lord it over material nature, although the living entity is in fact not a lord but an eternal servant. Due to this perverted tendency to exploit the entire world for his sense gratification, the living entity is also prone to try to pervert the principles of spiritual life so that the eternal religious principles become appropriate to his own material sense gratification. Religion, however, is meant for pleasing the Supreme Lord by obeying His laws. And therefore Lord Kåñëa Himself personally comes from time to time to revive and enliven the correct method of devotional service to His lotus feet. In the Eleventh Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is clearly stated that Lord Kåñëa had completed the vast majority of His pastimes on the earth and was now making the final arrangements for His departure. Therefore, He wished to leave behind a vivid lesson for the living entities of this age that any so-called religious person, even if he is so exalted as to take birth in the Lord's personal family, cannot violate the respect and reverence which is due to the pure devotees of the Lord, such as Närada Muni. The principle of serving the pure devotee of Kåñëa is so essential for spiritual advancement that the Lord exhibited the inconceivable pastime of causing the destruction of His entire dynasty just to impress this point upon the conditioned souls of Kali-yuga. Çrémad-Bhägavatam hints at the great misfortunes that would come after the disappearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such misfortunes also occurred after the disappearance of Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, who is accepted by Gauòéya Vaiñëavas as Kåñëa Himself. Through various instructions, the Bhägavatam provides for eliminating the cheating pseudoreligion that comes forth in human society after the departure of the Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Caitanya, exhibiting His magnanimous pastimes, drove away from South India all the false doctrines of the apasampradäyas, or so-called disciplic traditions of pseudodevotees, who had gained great influence by resorting to the atheistic theories of the Buddhists and Jains. Thus He turned all of India toward the devotional service of Lord Kåñëa, so that due to the extensive preaching of Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu and His followers there remained no topic of discussion in the world other than devotional service to the Supreme Lord. Tridaëòipäda Prabodhänanda Sarasvaté has elaborated on this in his verse stré-puträdi-kathäà jahur viñayiëaù.</div>
<div class="First"> Çré Narahari Sarakära Öhäkura, in his book Kåñëa-bhajanämåta, has corrected the improper statements of the gauräìga-nägaré-vädés, sakhébheka-vädés, and others of the eleven pseudodisciplic chains that claim to follow Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. These unauthorized persons present cheating in the guise of religion and advertise their duplicity as kathä, or pure worship of the Lord. Just as Kåñëa brought about a furious quarrel to destroy His own family, Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu arranged for the world to be flooded by varieties of Mäyäväda and karma-väda philosophies just after His disappearance. He did this to destroy persons who belonged to the eleven apasampradäyas, or unauthorized disciplic traditions, as well as the many other apasampradäyas that would appear in the future and presume to call themselves devotees of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu or pretend to be descendants in His family line. At the same time, Caitanya Mahäprabhu arranged for His own men to be kept away from the pseudodevotion of these cheaters. The devotees of Lord Gaurasundara, Caitanya Mahäprabhu, can discern the mysteries of His pastimes that manifest in the pastimes of Lord Kåñëa. The activities of the transcendental body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be understood in any ordinary mundane way. That is the essential meaning of this chapter.</div>
<div class="First"> Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, First Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Curse Upon the Yadu Dynasty."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 2. Mahäräja Nimi Meets the Nine Yogendras</div>
<div class="First"> In this chapter Närada gives instructions in bhägavata-dharma to the faithful and inquisitive Vasudeva by recounting a conversation between Mahäräja Nimi and the nine Yogendras.</div>
<div class="First"> Greatly eager to see Lord Kåñëa, Devarñi Närada resided almost exclusively in Dvärakä. Vasudeva, bewildered by the Lord's illusory potency, had previously offered worship to the Supreme Lord Ananta for the purpose of getting a son, but had failed to worship Him for liberation. Once Närada arrived at the home of Vasudeva, who worshiped him according to proper etiquette, greeted him respectfully and requested to hear about pure devotional service, which frees one from all kinds of fear. Närada praised Vasudeva's fixed intelligence and then related the ancient history of the conversation between the nine Yogendras, who were sons of Lord Åñabhadeva, and Nimi, the King of Videha.</div>
<div class="First"> Sväyambhuva Manu's son was Priyavrata. His son was Ägnédhra, whose son was Näbhi. Lord Åñabhadeva, the plenary portion of Väsudeva, incarnated as the son of Näbhi. The oldest of Åñabhadeva's one hundred sons was Bharata, an exalted devotee of Näräyaëa by whose name this earth, previously called Ajanäbha-varña, became famous as Bhärata-varña. Nine other sons of Åñabhadeva were widely known as the nava-yogendras: Kavi, Havir, Antarékña, Prabuddha, Pippaläyana, Ävirhotra, Drumila, Camasa and Karabhäjana. They were well versed in knowledge of the self, fixed in their goal and always striving for perfection. Nine other sons of Åñabhadeva took on the duty of kñatriyas and became masters of the nine dvépas comprising Bhärata-varña. His other eighty-one sons became brähmaëas expert in småti doctrines who propagated the path of fruitive sacrifice.</div>
<div class="First"> The nine Yogendras, free to move without impediment, traveled everywhere as they wished. They were direct associates of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Madhusüdana, and wandered freely to give protection to the various planets in the universe. The human body can be lost at any moment, but it is still a very rare attainment. Still rarer is to get the association of the confidential devotees of the Lord of Vaikuëöha while in this very human body. The association of such saintly persons, even for a fraction of a second, bestows all benefits on a living being. Therefore King Nimi offered the nine Yogendras suitable seats, worshiped them, humbled himself with obeisances and joyfully inquired from them about bhägavata-dharma. Bhägavata-dharma, or pure devotional service to the Lord, is the only means of ultimate good fortune for the soul. The Supreme Lord, being pleased by such service, offers His own self to the devotee.</div>
<div class="First"> In answer to the King's question, one of the nine Yogendras, Kavi, spoke as follows: "Those means of advancement which are described by the Personality of Godhead Himself and which enable even foolish persons easily to achieve perfect self-realization are called bhägavata-dharma. This bhägavata-dharma, manifested as service to the lotus feet of the infallible Supreme Lord, eradicates all fear for the living being. By abiding in bhägavata-dharma one will never stumble or fall, even while running with both eyes closed. Whatever one does with his body, mind, words, intelligence, consciousness, senses and natural proclivities should all be offered to Lord Näräyaëa. Living entities averse to the Lord's lotus feet come under the control of the Lord's illusory energy, mäyä. They forget the Lord's identity and are trapped by the illusion of identifying with the temporary body. Under the sway of material attraction, they become greatly fearful. Thus the best thing for them is to surrender their very life energy to a qualified guru and execute worship of the Supreme Lord, the absolute controller of mäyä, with pure devotion. Just as by eating one gradually appeases his hunger and with every bite feels more and more satisfied and nourished, a surrendered devotee achieves detachment from all objects other than Kåñëa, gains direct personal experience of the Lord and relishes pure love for the Lord, all simultaneously."</div>
<div class="First"> Next Havir spoke, describing the different characteristics of first-class, second-class and third-class devotees: "One who offers prescribed worship with faith to the Deity of Lord Viñëu but has no devotion for Vaiñëavas and things related to Viñëu is a materialistic devotee. One who shows love for the Lord, friendship for the Lord's devotees, mercy for the ignorant and indifference for the enemies of Viñëu and the Vaiñëavas is an intermediate devotee. And one who sees the presence of the Supreme Lord in everything and sees everything within the Lord is the topmost devotee." The first-class devotees are described in eight verses, which conclude by stating that the first-class devotee keeps the Supreme Lord perpetually fastened to his own heart with ropes of affection. Lord Hari never leaves the heart of such a devotee.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In the Second Chapter of this canto, bhägavata-dharma, or pure devotional service to Kåñëa, is explained by Närada Muni to Vasudeva, who had inquired with devotion. Närada Muni cites a conversation between King Nimi and the Jäyanteyas. According to Jéva Gosvämé, the word abhékñëam indicates that although Närada Muni was frequently sent by Lord Kåñëa here and there for various pastimes, such as inquiring about the affairs of the world, Närada continuously returned to reside in Dvärakä. The word kåñëopäsana-lälasaù indicates that Närada was very eager to be near Kåñëa and worship Him. Because of the curse of Dakña, Närada is never allowed to live continuously in one place. Çrédhara Svämé, however, has pointed out, na tasyäà çäpädeù prabhävaù: in Dvärakä there is no influence of curses or other such evils, because Dvärakä is the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is always protected by His arms, as shown by the word govinda-bhuja-guptäyäm. The conditioned souls are struggling within the kingdom of mäyä against the cruel laws of material nature, such as birth, death, old age and disease, but if such conditioned souls have the good fortune to enter the city of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whether Dvärakä, Mathurä or Våndävana, and live there under the direct protection of the omnipotent arms of the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, they will experience the unlimited transcendental bliss of real life, which is eternal and which is meant to be lived in the personal company of God.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear King, in the material world the conditioned souls are confronted by death at every step of life. Therefore, who among the conditioned souls would not render service to the lotus feet of Lord Mukunda, who is worshipable even for the greatest of liberated souls?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word indriyavän is significant in this verse. Indriyavän means "possessing senses." Although we are conditioned within the material world, by the mercy of the Supreme Lord we are awarded a human body, which possesses distinct senses, such as the eyes, ears, tongue, nose and skin. Generally the conditioned souls use these senses in a false attempt to exploit the material nature for sense gratification. But our material senses and their objects are temporary, and it is not possible to become peaceful or happy in the attempt to gratify our temporary senses with the temporary sense objects offered by mäyä, the illusory energy of the Lord. In fact, our strenuous endeavor to satisfy the material senses inevitably brings exactly the opposite result, namely material suffering. A man is attracted to a woman. Being sexually aroused he marries her, and soon there is a family that requires ever-increasing support. In this way his innocent and simple life is ended, and he spends the major portion of his life working hard like an ass to support the demands of his family. In the Third Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Lord Kapila describes very clearly that in spite of the exhausting work a man performs throughout his life, his family is ultimately dissatisfied, and when the exhausted father reaches old age, the irritated family members look upon him just as farmers look upon an old and useless ox. Sometimes the sons dream of receiving their father's money as an inheritance and secretly wish for him to die. Nowadays people strongly resent the trouble of caring for elderly parents and therefore send them to an institution, where they die lonely and neglected after a life of hard work for their so-called loved ones. One doctor in England is seriously proposing euthanasia for elderly persons who are no longer productive. Nowadays some people, desiring material sense gratification but hoping to avoid the inconvenience of family life, try to enjoy "free" sexual relations with women, without the trouble of marriage. Through birth control and abortion they eliminate the disturbance of caring for children. In this way they hope to enjoy material sense gratification without any material impediment. By the laws of nature, however, such persons become bound in a network of sinful reactions by avoiding their real duty to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and by thoughtlessly causing violence and suffering to others for increasing their own sense gratification. Caught in a network of impious activities, they drift further and further away from their original pure consciousness and gradually lose all power to understand the laws of nature. Therefore it is stated here, sarvato-måtyuù. Måtyu means "death." Death suddenly appears, startling such confident sense gratifiers, and destroys their entire program of so-called material happiness. Often such persons are afflicted with ghastly diseases and undergo inconceivable suffering, which ends in death. If a sincere well-wisher points these facts out to them, trying to inform them of the reality, they become angry and accuse him of being a pessimist or a religious fanatic. In this way they blindly ignore the laws of nature until these laws inevitably smash them down and drag them out of their fool's paradise. Because of an excessive accumulation of sinful results, they are forced into situations of great distress by the laws of karma. Sinking down into the lower species of life, they lose all awareness of that which lies beyond their gross material senses. Sometimes a living being is able to understand the miserable result of materialistic sense gratification. Being frustrated by the pain and suffering of materialistic life and being ignorant of any superior life, he adopts a neo-Buddhist philosophy and seeks shelter in so-called nothingness. But there is no actual void within the kingdom of God. The desire to merge into nothingness is a reaction against material pain; it is not a tangible concept of the Supreme. For example, if I feel unbearable pain in my leg and the pain cannot be cured, I may finally agree to have my leg amputated. But it is far better to remove the pain and keep my leg. Similarly, because of false ego we think, "I am everything. I am the most important person. No one is as intelligent as me." Thinking in this way, we suffer constantly and experience intense anxiety. But as soon as we purify the ego by admitting that we are insignificant eternal servants of Kåñëa, our ego will give us great pleasure. Çré Kåñëa, the Lord of the blissfully variegated spiritual sky, called Vaikuëöha, is always absorbed in transcendental enjoyment. In fact, Çré Kåñëa is the reservoir of all pleasure. People absorbed in materialistic enjoyment are bound by the laws of omnipresent death, but if we endeavor instead to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we can immediately be connected to His hlädiné çakti, or blissful potency. If we serve Kåñëa under the guidance of His authorized representative, the spiritual master, we can immediately get relief from material distress. Then we shall not yearn after nothing, but instead we shall be able to relish unlimited spiritual bliss in the service of the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> Sarvato-måtyuù also indicates that birth and death occur on every planet in the universe. Therefore our so-called space travel and cosmic consciousness are useless, since there is no eternal life anywhere within the material cosmos. In conclusion, to understand the futility of engaging in the service of anything other than Kåñëa and to engage instead in serving that which is eternal and full of bliss is the highest possible development of intelligence. Although our present intelligence is narrow, being conditioned by the laws of nature, we can create unlimited good fortune for ourselves by taking shelter of the lotus feet of Mukunda, learning to discriminate between that which is temporary and useless and that which is eternal and real.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Vasudeva herein describes the glories of Närada Muni. The words kåpaëänäà yathä pitror uttama-çloka-vartmanäm are significant. Kåpaëänäm refers to the most wretched persons, whereas uttama-çloka-vartmanäm refers to the most fortunate, those who are advanced in Kåñëa consciousness. Çrédhara Svämé has stated, tathä bhagavad-rüpasya bhavato yäträ sarva-dehinäm svastaya iti. The word bhagavad-rüpasya indicates that Närada Muni is an expansion of the Supreme Lord and that his activities therefore bring immense benefit for all living beings. In the First Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Närada Muni is described as a manifestation of the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There it is stated that Närada is especially empowered to give instructions in the art of devotional service to Kåñëa. Närada is especially able to advise the conditioned souls as to how they can dovetail their present activities with the devotional service of Kåñëa without unnecessarily disrupting their present life.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté has defined the word kåpaëa by quoting from the Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad (3.9.10). Etad akñaraà gärgi aviditväsmäl lokät praiti sa kåpaëaù: "O daughter of Gargäcärya, he who leaves this world without learning about the infallible Supreme is a kåpaëa, or miser." In other words, we are awarded the human form of life so that we may understand our eternal, blissful relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As indicated in verse 2 of this chapter by the word indriyavän, the human body is specifically awarded so that we may serve the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa. This human form of body is the greatest fortune because the highly evolved intelligence of human life enables us to understand Kåñëa, the Absolute Truth. If we are unable to understand our eternal relationship with God, we shall derive no permanent benefit whatsoever in this present life, nor can we ultimately benefit others. One who receives a great treasure but can neither use it himself nor dedicate it to the happiness of others is called a miser. Therefore, a person who leaves this world without having understood his actual position as servant of God is called a kåpaëa, or miser. This verse states that Närada Muni is so empowered in the devotional service of Kåñëa that he can lift even miserly rascals out of their illusion, just as a kind father goes to his child and wakes him from a distressing nightmare. Our present materialistic life is just like a troublesome dream, from which great souls such as Närada can wake us. Närada Muni is so powerful that even those already advanced in devotional service to Kåñëa can greatly enhance their spiritual position by hearing his instructions, as they will be given here in the Eleventh Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Therefore Çré Närada is the guru and father of all living beings, who are originally devotees of the Lord but who are now artificially attempting to enjoy the material world in the material bodies of human beings, animals, and so on.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> This verse clearly states that the pure devotees of the Lord such as Närada Muni are saintly persons, to be considered superior even to the demigods, the living beings empowered by the Supreme Lord to administer the entire universe. In Bhagavad-gétä (3.12) it is stated:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">iñöän bhogän hi vo devä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">däsyante yajïa-bhävitäù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tair dattän apradäyaibhyo</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yo bhuìkte stena eva saù</div>
<div class="First"> "The demigods in charge of the various necessities of life, being satisfied by the performance of yajïa [sacrifice], supply all necessities to man. But one who enjoys these gifts without offering them in return to the demigods is certainly a thief." In this connection Çréla Prabhupäda has made the following comment regarding the demigods: "The demigods are empowered administrators of material affairs. The supply of air, light, water and other blessings for maintaining the body and the soul of all living entities are entrusted to the demigods, who are innumerable assistants in the different parts of the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Their pleasure and displeasure depend on the performance of yajïas by the human being." In other words, by the Lord's arrangement, material prosperity depends upon the satisfaction of the demigods. If the demigods are dissatisfied due to nonperformance or improper performance of sacrifice, they are empowered to impose various types of suffering upon human beings. Usually this suffering takes the form of either excessive or insufficient supply of material necessities. For example, sunshine is necessary for life, but if there is excessive heat or insufficient heat from the sun, we suffer. Excessive or insufficient rain is also a cause of suffering. Thus the demigods bestow either happiness or suffering upon human beings, in accordance with the performance of sacrifice.</div>
<div class="First"> As stated here, however, great saintly persons such as Närada Muni are always merciful to all living beings.</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">titikñavaù käruëikäù</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">sädhavaù sädhu-bhüñaëäù</div>
<div class="First"> "The symptoms of a sädhu are that he is tolerant, merciful and friendly to all living entities, he has no enemies, he is peaceful, he abides by the scriptures, and all his characteristics are sublime." (SB 3.25.21) Çréla Prabhupäda, in his commentary on this verse, has portrayed the sädhu as follows: "A sädhu as described above is a devotee of the Lord. His concern, therefore, is to enlighten people in devotional service to the Lord. That is his mercy. He knows that without devotional service to the Lord, human life is spoiled. A devotee travels all over the country door to door preaching, 'Be Kåñëa conscious. Be a devotee of Lord Kåñëa. Don't spoil your life in simply fulfilling your animal propensities. Human life is meant for self-realization, or Kåñëa consciousness.' These are the preachings of a sädhu. He is not satisfied with his own liberation. He always thinks about others. He is the most compassionate personality toward all the fallen souls. One of his qualifications, therefore, is käruëika, great mercy to the fallen souls. While engaged in preaching work he has to meet with so many opposing elements, and therefore the sädhu, or devotee of the Lord, has to be very tolerant. Someone may ill-treat him, because the conditioned souls are not prepared to receive the transcendental knowledge of devotional service. They do not like it; that is their disease. The sädhu has the thankless task of impressing upon them the importance of devotional service. Sometimes devotees are personally attacked with violence. Lord Jesus Christ was crucified. Haridäsa Öhäkura was caned in twenty-two marketplaces, and Lord Caitanya's principal assistant, Nityänanda, was violently attacked by Jagäi and Mädhäi. But still they were tolerant because their mission was to deliver the fallen souls. One of the qualifications of a sädhu is that he is very tolerant and is merciful to all fallen souls. He is merciful because he is a well-wisher of all living entities. He is not only a well-wisher of human society, but a well-wisher of animal society as well. It is said here, sarva-dehinäm, which indicates all living entities who have accepted material bodies. Not only does a human being have a material body, but other living entities, such as cats and dogs, also have material bodies. The devotee of the Lord is merciful to everyone—the cats, dogs, trees, etc. He treats all living entities in such a way that they can ultimately get salvation from this material entanglement. Çivänanda Sena, one of the disciples of Lord Caitanya, gave liberation to a dog by treating the dog transcendentally. There are many instances where a dog got salvation by association with a sädhu, because a sädhu engages in the highest philanthropic activities for the benediction of all living entities. Although the sädhu is not inimical toward anyone, the world is so ungrateful that even a sädhu has many enemies.</div>
<div class="First"> "What is the difference between an enemy and a friend? It is a difference in behavior. A sädhu behaves with all conditioned souls for their ultimate relief from material entanglement. Therefore, no one can be more friendly than the sädhu in relieving a conditioned soul. A sädhu is calm, and he quietly and peacefully follows the principles of scripture and at the same time is a devotee of the Lord. One who actually follows the principles of scripture must be a devotee of God because all the çästras instruct us to obey the orders of the Personality of Godhead. Sädhu, therefore, means a follower of the scriptural injunctions and a devotee of the Lord. All these characteristics are prominent in a devotee. A devotee develops all the good qualities of the demigods, whereas a nondevotee, even though academically qualified, has no actual good qualifications or good characteristics according to the standards of transcendental realization."</div>
<div class="First"> Vasudeva, therefore, has used the word sädhu to describe Närada Muni, indicating that the position of the devotee of the Lord is superior even to that of the demigods.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The words chäyeva karma-saciväù are significant here. Chäyä means "shadow." The shadow of the body precisely follows the movements of the body. The shadow has no power to move in a way different from the movement of the body. Similarly, as stated here, bhajanti ye yathä devän devä api tathäiva tän: the results the demigods award to living beings correspond exactly to the living beings' actions. The demigods are empowered by the Lord to follow precisely the particular karma of a living entity in awarding him happiness and distress. Just as a shadow cannot move independently, the demigods cannot punish or reward a living being independently. Although the demigods are millions of times more powerful than the human beings on earth, they are ultimately tiny servants of God whom the Lord allows to play as the controllers of the universe. In the Fourth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Påthu Mahäräja, an empowered incarnation of the Lord, states that even the demigods are subject to punishment by the Lord if they deviate from His laws. On the other hand, devotees of the Lord such as Närada Muni, by their potent preaching, can interfere in the karma of a living being by persuading him to give up his fruitive activity and mental speculation and surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In material existence, one works hard under the bondage of ignorance. But if one becomes enlightened by association with a pure devotee of the Lord, one can understand one's actual position as an eternal servant of God. By rendering such service, one dissolves his attachment to the material world and the reactions of his previous activities, and as a surrendered soul he is endowed with unlimited spiritual freedom in the service of the Lord. In this regard, the Brahma-saàhitä (5.54) states: yas tv indragopam athavendram aho sva-karmabandhänurüpa-</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">phala-bhäjanam ätanoti</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">karmäëi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhäjäà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi</div>
<div class="First"> "I adore the primeval Lord, Govinda, who burns to the root all the fruitive activities of those imbued with devotion. For those who walk the path of work—no less for Indra, king of the demigods, than for the tiny insect indragopa—He impartially ordains the due enjoyments of the fruits of activities in accordance with the chain of works previously performed." Even the demigods are bound to the laws of karma, whereas a pure devotee of the Lord, having completely given up the desire for material enjoyment, successfully burns to ashes all traces of karma.</div>
<div class="First"> In this regard, Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has commented that unless one is engaged as a surrendered soul in the devotional service of the Lord, he cannot actually be considered niñkäma, or free from all personal desire. Sometimes a materialistic person will engage in charity or altruistic activities and in this way consider himself a selfless worker. Similarly, those who engage in mental speculation with the ultimate goal of merging into the impersonal Brahman aspect of the Lord also advertise themselves as being selfless or desireless. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté, however, such karmés and jïänés, while busy in their so-called "selflessness," are in fact servants of lusty desires. In other words, they have not perfectly understood their position as eternal servants of God. The altruistic karmé falsely considers himself the best friend of humanity, although he is unable to give actual benefit to others because he is ignorant of the eternal life of bliss and knowledge beyond the temporary hallucination of material existence. Similarly, although the jïäné proudly declares himself God and invites others to become God also, he neglects to explain how the so-called gods have come to be bound by the laws of material nature. Actually, the attempt to become God is based not on love of God but on the desire to take the same status as God. In other words, the desire to be equal in all respects to the Supreme is simply another materialistic desire. Therefore the karmés and jïänés, because of their dissatisfaction in artificially trying to fulfill their own desires, can show no actual mercy to the fallen souls. In this regard, Çré Madhväcärya has quoted the Uddäma-saàhitä:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sukham icchanti bhütänäà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">präyo duùkhäsahä nåëäm</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tathäpi tebhyaù pravarä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">devä eva hareù priyäù</div>
<div class="First"> "Åñis want happiness for all beings and are almost always incapable of tolerating the unhappiness of men. Nevertheless, the demigods are superior because they are very dear to Lord Hari." But although Çréla Madhväcärya has placed the demigods in a higher position than the merciful åñis, Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has stated, sädhavas tu na karmänugatäù: the sädhus are actually better than the demigods because the sädhus are merciful regardless of the pious or impious acts of the conditioned souls. This apparent disagreement between Madhväcärya and Jéva Gosvämé is resolved by Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, who points out that in the statement by Çréla Madhväcärya, the word åñi, or "sage," indicates the so-called sädhus or saintly persons among the karmés and jïänés. Ordinary fruitive workers and speculative philosophers certainly consider themselves to be at the summit of pious morality and altruism. However, since they are ignorant of the supreme position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they cannot be considered equal to the demigods, who are all devotees of the Lord and aware that all living beings are eternal servants of the Lord. Even such demigods, however, cannot be compared to the pure devotees such as Närada. Such pure devotees are empowered to award the highest perfection of life to both pious and impious living beings, who have only to follow the orders of such pure devotees.</div>

<div class="First"> According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, Närada Muni might have been reluctant to instruct Vasudeva because of natural respect for Vasudeva's exalted position as the father of Kåñëa. Närada might have thought that since Vasudeva was already perfect in Kåñëa consciousness there was no need to instruct him in the process of devotional service. Therefore, anticipating Närada's possible reluctance, Vasudeva specifically requested Närada to preach to him about devotional service to Kåñëa. This is the symptom of a pure devotee. A pure devotee of Kåñëa never considers himself exalted. To the contrary, he meekly feels that his devotional service is most imperfect but that somehow or other Lord Kåñëa, out of His causeless mercy, is accepting such imperfect service.</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">Caitanya Mahäprabhu has stated in this regard,</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">[Cc. Ädi 17.31]</div>
<div class="First"> "One can chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, feeling himself lower than the straw in the street. One should be more tolerant than a tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige, and ready to offer all respect to others." (Çikñäñöaka 3) The conditioned souls in this material world become falsely proud of their so-called family lineage. This pride is false because one who has taken birth in the material world is in a fallen situation, even in the best of cases. Vasudeva, however, was certainly not fallen, since he had taken birth in the family of Kåñëa. Since he was Kåñëa's father, his position was most exalted, yet because he was a pure devotee he did not become proud of his special relationship with Kåñëa. Instead, considering himself deficient in spiritual understanding, he took advantage of the appearance of Närada Muni, a great preacher of Kåñëa consciousness, by immediately inquiring from him about devotional service. This incomparable humility of a pure devotee of Kåñëa is far superior to the false humility of the impersonalist, who actually maintains a desire to be equal to God though adopting the external behavior of a meek and saintly person.</div>
<div class="First"> Bhayam, or fear, is caused by seeing something other than Kåñëa (dvitéyäbhiniveçataù). Everything is actually an emanation from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as stated in Vedänta-sutra (janmädy asya yataù [SB 1.1.1]) and as confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä (ahaà sarvasya prabhavaù [Bg. 10.8], väsudevaù sarvam iti, etc. [Bg. 7.19]). Kåñëa is the well-wishing friend of every living entity (suhådam sarva-bhütänäm [Bg. 5.29]). If a living being gives up his misguided attempt to defy the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrenders to the Lord, certainly he becomes confident in his eternal relationship with Kåñëa. A surrendered soul can actually experience that Kåñëa is his well-wishing friend, and since that friend is the supreme absolute controller of all existence, there is certainly no cause for fear. The son of a rich man certainly feels confident while touring the estate of his father. Similarly, an empowered representative of the government feels confident in the discharge of his duty. In the same way, a devotee of Kåñëa, acting as a representative of the Supreme Lord, feels confident because he can understand at every moment that the entire material and spiritual creation is strictly under the control of his benevolent master. The nondevotee, however, denies the supreme position of Kåñëa and therefore imagines that something is different from Kåñëa. For example, if a servant of the government thinks that there is some dangerous obstacle that cannot be controlled by the government's power, he becomes fearful. If a child feels that there is some power that cannot be subdued by his father, then he becomes fearful. Similarly, because we artificially think that there is something within existence that is not under the strict control of the benevolent Lord, we become fearful. Such a concept of a second thing (something other than Kåñëa) is called dvitéyäbhiniveça, and it immediately creates a foreign atmosphere of bhayam, or fear. Kåñëa is called abhayaìkara, which means that He destroys all fear in the heart of His devotee. Sometimes so-called scholars, distraught after many years of impersonal speculation and enjoyment of materialistic life, become fearful and anxious. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté compares such disturbed philosophers to the bound vulture in the Chändogya Upaniñad. Desiring liberation from fear, such speculators unfortunately concoct an imaginary liberation (vimukta-mäninaù) and try to take shelter of impersonal spiritual existence or voidness. But the Bhägavatam (10.2.32) states, äruhya kåcchreëa paraà padaà tataù/ patanty adho 'nädåta-yuñmad-aìghrayaù: because such speculators have not rectified their original mistake of rejecting their eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they fall from their concocted liberation and thus remain in a fearful condition. Vasudeva, however, is openly eager to hear more and more about devotional service to Kåñëa, and therefore he states, yän çrutvä çraddhayä martyo mucyate sarvato bhayät: simply by hearing about pure devotional service to Kåñëa, a conditioned soul can easily free himself from all types of fear, and this transcendental freedom is certainly eternal.</div>

<div class="Translation"> In a previous birth on this earth, I worshiped the Supreme Lord, Ananta, who alone can award liberation, but because I desired to have a child, I did not worship Him for liberation. Thus I was bewildered by the Lord's illusory energy.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çrédhara Svämé the word kila (meaning "indeed, it is true," "it is said" or "as is well known") indicates that Vasudeva was remembering the words the Lord had spoken to him when the Lord had appeared as four-armed Viñëu in the prison of Kaàsa. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé states that from the anxiety of Vasudeva, which is expressed in this verse by the words apüjayaà na mokñäya mohito deva-mäyayä, it is to be discerned that Vasudeva had heard of the curse of the brähmaëas at Piëòäraka against the Yadu dynasty and that he could understand from this curse that the Lord's disappearance from the earth was imminent. Vasudeva understood that the Lord's manifest pastimes within this universe were coming to an end, and he now lamented that he had not directly taken advantage of the opportunity to worship Kåñëa to go back home, back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="First"> Significantly, Vasudeva has used the word mukti-dam to describe the Lord. Mukti-dam is a synonym of Mukunda, or that personality who can give liberation from the cycle of birth and death. It is stated in Vedic literature that even the demigods are bound to the cycle of birth and death, although their life span is inconceivably long by earthly calculations. It is the almighty God alone who can free the conditioned soul from the reactions to his previous sinful activities and award him an eternal life of bliss and knowledge. Vasudeva lamented that he had desired Kåñëa to come to him as a son instead of desiring to go back to Kåñëa, back to Godhead, to serve the Lord in the spiritual sky. Commenting on this incident in the Tenth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Çréla Prabhupäda has emphasized that we should desire to go back home, back to Godhead, rather than try to bring the Lord to this world as our son. Nor can we artificially imitate the severe penances Vasudeva and Devaké performed for thousands of heavenly years in their previous births as Sutapä and Påçni. In this connection Çréla Prabhupäda states, "If we want to get the Supreme Personality of Godhead to become one of us in this material world, this requires great penance, but if we want to go back to Kåñëa (tyaktvä dehaà punar janma naiti mäm eti so 'rjuna [Bg. 4.9]), we need only understand Him and love Him. Through love only we can very easily go back home, back to Godhead." Çréla Prabhupäda goes on to explain that Caitanya Mahäprabhu freely bestows the benediction of love of Kåñëa, which allows one to return to Kåñëa's abode, through the chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mantra. This chanting process is far more effective in this age than artificial attempts to perform severe penances and austerities. Çréla Prabhupäda concludes, "Therefore, one need not undergo severe penances for many thousands of years. One need only learn how to love Kåñëa and be always engaged in His service (sevonmukhe hi jihvädau svayam eva sphuraty adaù [Brs. 1.2.234(87)]). Then one can very easily go back home, back to Godhead. Instead of bringing the Lord here for some material purpose, to have a son or whatever else, if we go back home, back to Godhead, our real relationship with the Lord is revealed, and we eternally engage in our eternal relationship. By chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra, we gradually develop our eternal relationship with the Supreme Person and thus attain the perfection called svarüpa-siddhi(88). We should take advantage of this benediction and go back home, back to Godhead." (SB 10.3.38 purport) Although Vasudeva and Devaké desired that Kåñëa become their son, it should be understood that they are devotees eternally situated in love of Kåñëa. As stated by the Lord Himself (SB 10.3.39), mohitau devamäyayä: Vasudeva and Devaké, His pure devotees, were covered by His internal potency. In the Fourth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (4.1.20) the great sage Atri Muni prayed to the Lord, prajäm ätma-samäà mahyaà prayacchatu: "Kindly be pleased to offer me a son exactly like You." Atri Muni said he wanted a son exactly like the Lord, and therefore he was not a pure devotee, because he had a desire to be fulfilled and that desire was material. If he had desired the Supreme Personality of Godhead as his child, he would have been completely free of material desires because he would have wanted the Supreme Absolute Truth, but because he wanted a similar child, his desire was material. Thus Atri Muni cannot be counted among the pure devotees. Vasudeva and Devaké, however, did want the Lord Himself, and therefore they were pure devotees of the Lord. In this verse, therefore, Vasudeva's statement apüjayaà na mokñäya mohito deva-mäyayä should be taken to mean that Kåñëa's internal potency bewildered Vasudeva so that he would desire Kåñëa as his son. This paved the way for the Lord's appearance as the son of His loving devotees.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word mucyema is significant here. In the previous verse Vasudeva stated that because he had been bewildered by the illusory energy of the Lord he could not achieve from the Supreme Personality of Godhead the boon of liberation. Therefore he is now approaching the pure devotee of the Lord, confident that by the mercy of the Lord's devotee he will certainly achieve liberation from material bondage.</div>
<div class="First"> In this connection the words aïjasä, "easily," and addhä, "directly," are very important. Although foolish persons proudly want to jump up directly to the Supreme Personality of Godhead without accepting His pure devotee as spiritual master, those who are experienced in spiritual science know that by submission and service at the lotus feet of a pure devotee one directly contacts the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (11.17.27) Lord Kåñëa has stated, äcäryaà mäà vijänéyän nävamanyeta karhicit. Thus one should understand that the pure devotee of Kåñëa stands on the same spiritual level as the Lord Himself. This does not mean that a pure devotee is also God, but because of his intimate loving connection with the Lord, he is accepted by the Lord as being the Lord's very soul. In other words, Kåñëa is always in the heart of His pure devotee, and the pure devotee is always in the heart of Kåñëa. Although Çré Kåñëa is eternally the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one without a second, the Lord is more pleased to see His pure devotee worshiped. Therefore the Lord says, äcäryaà mäà vijänéyät. One must offer the same respect to the Vaiñëava spiritual master as one would offer to the Lord. Therefore as soon as one pleases the Vaiñëava spiritual master, one immediately pleases Kåñëa and makes spiritual advancement. The word aïjasä means that this bona fide process is the easiest method of achieving spiritual perfection. And because the pure devotee is a transparent medium, the word addhä, "directly," is used, indicating that service rendered to the pure devotee goes directly to the lotus feet of Kåñëa, whereas service one whimsically offers to Kåñëa directly, bypassing the bona fide spiritual master, is not actually accepted and is therefore useless.</div>
<div class="First"> Those who actually desire the highest perfection, that of going back home, back to the eternal, blissful kingdom of Kåñëa, should study very carefully the example shown by Çré Vasudeva in these two verses. He indicates that although one cannot achieve liberation by directly worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can very easily achieve the perfection of life simply by a moment's association with a pure devotee of Lord Kåñëa such as Närada Muni, the exalted Vaiñëava saint among the demigods. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the word viçvato-bhayät indicates that Vasudeva very much feared the curse of the brähmaëas. As one can become perfect by worshiping the Vaiñëavas, by displeasing the Vaiñëavas one can bring about all misfortune. Thus Vasudeva feared the curse delivered by the brähmaëas at Piëòäraka-tértha.</div>

<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has commented that the word sad-dharma refers to bhägavata-dharma. This is also confirmed by Çrédhara Svämé. Bhägavata-dharma is spiritually so powerful that even those who by worldly standards are implicated in various ways in sinful behavior can easily be purified by adopting any of the processes mentioned in this verse. In the practice of ordinary piety, one worships God with the expectation of receiving something in return for one's service. Similarly, the impersonalist aspires for his own liberation, wishfully thinking that he will become equal to God. In bhägavata-dharma, however, there is no such impurity. Bhägavata-dharma is devotional service to the Lord in which the only objective is the satisfaction of the Lord. If one rejects this process and instead wants to hear about, teach or meditate upon another process, the chance for immediate purification is lost. Neither ordinary materialistic yoga processes meant for achieving mystic powers nor impersonal processes based on speculation have the power to purify immediately those who have fallen into sinful behavior. Sad-dharma, or bhägavata-dharma, pure devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is unique in that even the most fallen souls can immediately rise to the highest perfectional stage by surrendering at the lotus feet of Kåñëa or His pure devotee. This was vividly demonstrated in the preaching work of Caitanya Mahäprabhu, especially in the case of the sinful brothers Jagäi and Mädhäi.</div>

The word smärita, "he is brought back to memory," indicates that because of Närada's absorption in the worship of Kåñëa he had forgotten Lord Nara-Näräyaëa.

<div class="First"> The words itihäsam purätanam, meaning "ancient historical account," are significant here. Çrémad-Bhägavatam is nigama-kalpa-taror galitam phalam [SB 1.1.3], the ripe fruit of the desire tree of Vedic knowledge. In the pages of the Bhägavatam we find true historical narrations relating to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the liberation of the conditioned souls. These historical accounts are not fiction or mythology, but describe the wonderful activities of the Lord and His devotees that took place in yugas previous to the advent of this puny age. Although mundane scholars have foolishly tried to depict the Bhägavatam as a mythological work or a recent creation, the actual fact is that Çrémad-Bhägavatam is a perfect transcendental literature describing not only the entire situation of this universe but also that which lies far beyond this universe, in both the material and spiritual skies. If one seriously studies the Çrémad-Bhägavatam he becomes the most learned intellectual man. Caitanya Mahäprabhu desires that all pious persons become highly learned by hearing Çrémad-Bhägavatam and then preach the glories of the Lord in a scientific way all over the world. It is essential that we hear these historical narrations, such as the conversation between the nava-yogendras and King Videha, with complete faith and submission. Then, as stated in verse 12 of this chapter, even if our former life is filled with abominable activities, simply by hearing Çrémad-Bhägavatam we shall be promoted to the same transcendental status as the Lord and His pure devotees. This is the extraordinary power of bhägavata history, as contrasted with useless, mundane historical accounts, which ultimately serve no purpose. Although mundane historians justify their work on the plea that we have to learn from history, we can practically see that the world situation is now rapidly deteriorating into unbearable conflict and chaos while so-called historians stand helplessly by. But the bhägavata historians who have faithfully heard Çrémad-Bhägavatam can give perfect and potent instructions for the restoration of a peaceful and blissful world. Therefore those who are inclined to enrich their intellectual life through the study of history should educate themselves in the historical narrations of Çrémad-Bhägavatam. This will bring them the perfection of intellectual and spiritual life.</div>

(2.44); (3) What is the external energy of Viñëu, the Supreme Lord? (3.1); (4) How can one become dissociated from this mäyä? (3.17); (5)What is the true identity of Brahman? (3.34); (6) What are the three types of karma, namely karma based on the enjoyment of the fruits of work, karma offered to the Supreme Lord, and naiñkarmya? (3.41); (7) What are the various pastimes of the various incarnations of God? (4.1); (8) What is the aim or destination of one who is against the Supreme Lord and devoid of bhakti (in other words, a nondevotee)? (5.1); and (9)What are the respective colors, forms and names of the four yugävatäras, the four incarnations of the Supreme Lord who appear in the four ages, and what is the process of worshiping each of Them?

<div class="Translation"> These sages wandered the earth seeing the entire universe, with all its gross and subtle objects, as a manifestation of the Supreme Lord and as nondifferent from the self.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, it is clearly demonstrated in this and the following verse that the nine saintly sons of Åñabhadeva known as the nava-yogendras were situated in the highest stage of spiritual perfection, called päramahaàsya-caritam, or "having fully developed the character of paramahaàsas." In other words, they were pure devotees of the Lord. According to Çrédhara Svämé and Jéva Gosvämé, the words ätmano 'vyatirekeëa indicate that the nine sages saw the universe as being nondifferent from themselves as well as nondifferent from the Supreme Soul, Lord Kåñëa. Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has additionally commented, ätmanaù paramätmanaù sakäçäd avyatirekeëa, viçvasya tac-chakti-mayatväd iti bhävaù: "Ätmanaù indicates the Supersoul. This universe is not different from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Paramätmä, since the entire universe is composed of His energy."</div>
<div class="First"> Although it is stated here that the cosmic manifestation is nondifferent from both the living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one should not think that either the living entity or the Supreme Lord is material. A Vedic aphorism states, asaìgo hy ayaà puruñaù: "The living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead have nothing to do with the material world." Furthermore, Bhagavad-gétä says that the entire universe, consisting of eight gross and subtle elements, constitutes the bhinnä prakåti, or aparä prakåti—the separated, inferior energy—of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Kåñëa clearly states in Bhagavad-gétä that He has eternally established His own abode in the kingdom of God, where life is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge, and that the living entity, being part and parcel of God, is also eternal (mamaiväàço jéva-loke jéva-bhütaù sanätanaù [Bg. 15.7]). Furthermore, once having gone to that eternal abode of the Lord the living entity never returns to this temporary manifestation (yaà präpya na nivartante tad dhäma paramaà mama).</div>
<div class="First"> One may therefore ask why the living entity and the Supreme Lord are stated to be nondifferent from the material universe. The question is very nicely answered by Çréla Närada Muni in the First Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.5.20). Idaà hi viçvaà bhagavän ivetaro yato jagat-sthäna-nirodha-sambhaväù: "The Supreme Lord Personality of Godhead is Himself this cosmos, and still He is aloof from it. From Him only has this cosmic manifestation emanated, in Him it rests, and unto Him it enters after annihilation." Commenting on Närada's statement, Çréla Prabhupäda has very nicely explained this delicate philosophical point: "For a pure devotee, the conception of Mukunda, Lord Çré Kåñëa, is both personal and impersonal. The impersonal cosmic situation is also Mukunda because it is the emanation of the energy of Mukunda. For example, a tree is a complete unit, whereas the leaves and branches of the tree are emanated parts and parcels of the tree. The leaves and branches of the tree are also the tree, but the tree itself is neither the leaves nor the branches. The Vedic version that the whole cosmic creation is nothing but Brahman means that since everything is emanating from the Supreme Brahman, nothing is apart from Him. Similarly, the part-and-parcel hands and legs are called the body, but the body as the whole unit is neither the hands nor the legs. The Lord is the transcendental form of eternity, cognition and beauty. And thus the creation of the energy of the Lord appears to be partially eternal, full of knowledge and beautiful also.... "According to the Vedic version, the Lord is naturally fully powerful, and thus His supreme energies are always perfect and identical with Him. Both the spiritual and the material skies and their paraphernalia are emanations of the internal and external energies of the Lord. External energy is comparatively inferior, whereas the internal potency is superior. The superior energy is living force, and therefore she is completely identical [with the Lord], but the external energy, being inert, is partially identical. But both the energies are neither equal to nor greater than the Lord, who is the generator of all energies; such energies are always under His control, exactly as electrical energy, however powerful it may be, is always under the control of the engineer. "The human being and all other living beings are products of His internal energies. Thus the living being is also identical with the Lord. But he is never equal or superior to the Personality of Godhead."</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Prabhupäda has clearly explained here that both the cosmic manifestation and the living entities are emanations from the Supreme Lord, as confirmed both in Vedanta-sutra and in the opening statement of Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Janmädy asya yataù: [SB 1.1.1] "The Absolute Truth is that from which everything emanates." Similarly, the Éçopaniñad states:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">oà pürëam adaù pürëam idaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">pürëät pürëam udacyate</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">pürëasya pürëam ädäya</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">pürëam evävaçiñyate</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">[Éço Invocation]</div>
<div class="First"> The Supreme Lord, the Absolute Truth, is pürëa, or complete in Himself. And since this cosmic world is a manifestation of His potency, it also appears to be pürëa. In other words, because this material world is an emanation from the Supreme Lord, it is nondifferent from Him, exactly as the sun's rays are nondifferent from the sun globe, which is the source of their emanation. Similarly the living beings, who are expansions of the superior, or conscious, energy of the Supreme Lord, are also nondifferent from Kåñëa, although this nondifference is qualitative and not quantitative. The gold found in golden ornaments such as rings and bracelets is qualitatively identical with the gold in a mine, but the gold in the mine is quantitatively far superior to the tiny quantity of gold in a bracelet or ring. Similarly, although we are qualitatively one with God, being spiritual emanations of His unlimited potency, we are quantitatively infinitesimal and eternally subordinate to His supreme power. Therefore the Lord is called vibhu, or infinitely potent, and we are aëu, or infinitesimal and dependent. This is further confirmed in the Vedic literature by the statement nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm/ eko bahünäà yo vidadhäti kämän (Kaöha Upaniñad 2.2.13). There are innumerable eternal living entities who are eternally and totally dependent upon the supreme singular living entity, the Supreme Lord. That dependence is not an illusion created by material existence, as stated by the impersonalist philosophers, but is an eternal relationship in which the Lord is eternally superior and we are eternally inferior. The Lord is eternally independent, and we are eternally dependent. The Lord is eternally absolute in Himself, and we are eternally relative to His supreme personality.</div>
<div class="First"> Although the Lord is infinitely greater than any other living being, or than all of them combined, every living being is qualitatively nondifferent from the Lord, because all living beings are parts and parcels emanating from Him (mamaiväàço jéva-loke jéva-bhütaù sanätanaù [Bg. 15.7]). Therefore, in one sense, the living entity is also not different from the material cosmic manifestation, which is an inferior sister energy of the Lord. Both the living entity and the material nature are prakåti, or feminine, dependent expansions of the supreme puruña. The difference is that the living entity is the superior energy of the Lord, because the living entity is conscious and eternal like the Lord, whereas material energy is the inferior energy of the Lord, lacking consciousness and eternal form.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has emphasized in this regard that the absolute substance is one and is called Paramätmä, or the Supersoul. When one has achieved but a partial vision of the Paramätmä, one's understanding of life is called ätma-darçana, or self-realization. And when even this partial understanding is lacking, one's existential condition is called anätma-darçana, or ignorance of the self. In the state of partial realization of the Supersoul, without recognition of the Paramätmä's distinction from the individual soul, the living entity tends to become puffed up by his spiritual achievement, be carried away by mental concoction, and consider himself equal in all respects with God. On the other hand, the living entity situated in anätma-darçana, or material ignorance, feels that he is completely different from the Supreme Lord; and since everyone in this material world is interested in himself, the living entity forgets about God, thinking that God is completely different from him and that there is therefore no substantial relationship between him and God. In this way the impersonal transcendentalists emphasize only the oneness between God and the living entity, whereas the ordinary materialists overemphasize the difference between God and the living entity. But Caitanya Mahäprabhu has clearly revealed that the Ultimate Truth is simultaneous oneness and difference (acintya-bhedäbheda-tattva(89)). Actually we are eternally different from God. Because the living entity and God are eternally separate individual entities, there exists the possibility of an eternal relationship. And because every living entity is qualitatively one with the Supreme Lord, that relationship constitutes the essence of the ultimate reality for every living being. As stated in the Caitanya-caritämåta (Madhya 20.108), jévera 'svarüpa' haya-kåñëera 'nitya-däsa.' The ultimate essential identity of every living entity is his relationship with the Supreme Lord as a servitor of the Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> If one can understand that he is an eternal servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can correctly understand that both the living entity and the material universe are identical with Kåñëa, being emanations from Him, and that they are therefore nondifferent from each other. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté has stated, "The material world is a manifestation of simultaneous difference and nondifference, and it is a form of the Supreme Lord. Thus the temporary, perishable and ever-changing material world is different from Vaikuëöha, the eternal world."</div>
<div class="First"> It should be noted that in this verse the word sad-asad-ätmakam, or "made up of gross and subtle objects," does not refer to material and spiritual objects. This universe is stated to be composed of sat and asat, gross and subtle material objects. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté, "The very subtle state within the manifest world is known as 'the unmanifest,' and the realm beyond the manifest world is called 'transcendental.' Within the coverings surrounding the manifest, in the region of the time factor, is the phase of material existence experienced by the controlling deities; in this phase exist the two functions cause (asat) and effect (sat). In the universe, which is a third tattva, or reality (apart from and containing both sat and asat), and which is a form of the Supreme Lord, it is impossible to produce any contradiction to the nondual Absolute Truth." In other words, although ignorant, materialistic scientists may zealously carry out research to find a material principle that can negate or render unnecessary the existence of God, Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté clearly states that since the universe is an emanation from the Lord and therefore spiritually identical with Him, there cannot possibly exist anywhere within the universe a material law, principle or phenomenon that in any way contradicts the supremacy of the Personality of Godhead. In fact, the entire universe, along with the spiritual sky, exists as eternal testimony to the unlimited glory of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. With this understanding, the nine Yogendras were traveling about the earth in transcendental bliss.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word yathärhataù is significant here. According to Viçvanätha Cakravarté the word yathärhataù means yathocitam, or "according to the proper etiquette." It is clearly mentioned here that the nava-yogendras are näräyaëa-paräyaëa, exalted devotees of the Supreme Lord, Näräyaëa, or Kåñëa. Therefore, the word yathärhataù indicates that the King worshiped the nine sages according to the standard Vaiñëava etiquette. The etiquette for worshiping exalted Vaiñëavas is expressed by Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura with the words säkñäd-dharitvena samasta-çästraiù: an exalted Vaiñëava, being totally surrendered to the will of the Supreme Lord, is taken to be a transparent medium for the Lord's will. In the Caitanya-caritämåta it is stated that even by a moment's association with the pure devotees of the Lord one can achieve all perfection in life. Therefore, as indicated by the word prétaù, King Nimi was overjoyed by the auspicious arrival of the sages, and therefore he worshiped them just as one would worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="First"> Although impersonalist philosophers claim that every living entity is equal to God, they callously step over the heads of their so-called spiritual masters and freely speculate on the nature of the Absolute, giving their own whimsical opinions in defiance of the impersonal whims of their so-called gurus. In other words, although Mäyävädé impersonalists claim that everyone is God, they ultimately show an offensive mentality toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead in rejecting the reality of His eternal form and pastimes. Thus, they unwittingly belittle the eternal position of all living beings by denying their eternal personality and activities in the kingdom of God. The impersonalists, through their mental concoctions, try to minimize the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entities who are part of Him, reducing them theoretically to a formless, nameless light, which by their concoction they claim to be the Absolute God. The Vaiñëavas, however, welcome the Supreme Personality of Godhead and easily understand that the unlimited Supreme Personality has nothing to do with the conditioned, limited, mundane personalities we find in the material world. The impersonalists arrogantly assume that there could not be any transcendental or unlimited personality beyond our present experience. But the Vaiñëavas intelligently understand that there are many wonderful things far beyond our limited experience. Therefore they accept the words of Kåñëa, who states in Bhagavad-gétä (15.19):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yo mäm evam asammüòho</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">jänäti puruñottamam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sa sarva-vid bhajati mäà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sarva-bhävena bhärata</div>
<div class="First"> "Whoever knows Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without doubting, is the knower of everything, and he therefore engages himself in full devotional service, O son of Bharata." In this connection Çréla Prabhupäda states, "There are many philosophical speculations about the constitutional position of the living entities and the Supreme Absolute Truth. Now in this verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead clearly explains that anyone who knows Lord Kåñëa as the Supreme Person is actually the knower of everything. The imperfect knower goes on simply speculating about the Absolute Truth, but the perfect knower, without wasting his valuable time, engages directly in Kåñëa consciousness, the devotional service of the Supreme Lord.... It is not that one should simply speculate academically. One should submissively hear from Bhagavad-gétä that these living entities are always subordinate to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anyone who is able to understand this, according to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, knows the purpose of the Vedas; no one else knows the purpose of the Vedas." Therefore, exalted devotees such as the nine Yogendras always accept the supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as expressed here by the word näräyaëa-paräyaëän.</div>
<div class="First"> King Nimi was a Vaiñëava, and therefore he worshiped the great sages with the same respect with which he would worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as shown by the word yathärhataù. Although impersonalists falsely claim that every living entity is equal to God, they cannot properly respect any living being, because of their original offense at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality. Their so-called worship, even of their own gurus, is ultimately self-serving and opportunistic. When an impersonalist imagines that he has become God, he has no further need for his so-called guru. The Vaiñëava, however, because he accepts the supremacy of the eternal Personality of Godhead, is ready and willing to offer eternal respect to all living beings, especially to those most fortunate living beings who have achieved shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord. A Vaiñëava's worship of the Lord's representative is not self-serving or opportunistic, but is an expression of eternal love for the Lord and His representatives, as indicated here by the word prétaù. Therefore it is clear from this verse that not only the nine exalted sons of Åñabhadeva but also King Nimi himself were all great devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in defiance of the artificial and limited concept of impersonalism.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Overwhelmed by transcendental joy, the King humbly bowed his head and then proceeded to question the nine sages. These nine great souls glowed with their own effulgence and thus appeared equal to the four Kumäras, the sons of Lord Brahmä.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has pointed out that the word sva-rucä indicates that the nava-yogendras glowed from their own spiritual effulgence and not due to their ornaments or any other cause. The Supreme Soul, Lord Kåñëa, is the original source of all light. His brilliantly glowing body is the source of the all-pervading brahmajyoti, the immeasurable spiritual light that is the resting place of innumerable universes (yasya prabhä prabhavato jagad-aëòa-koöi [Bs. 5.40]). The individual soul, being part and parcel of the Lord, is also self-effulgent. In fact, everything in the kingdom of God is self-effulgent, as described in Bhagavad-gétä (15.6):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na tad bhäsayate süryo</div>

<div class="First"> It has already been described in many ways that the nava-yogendras were pure devotees of the Lord. Being completely Kåñëa conscious souls, they naturally radiated the intense effulgence of the soul, as indicated here by the word sva-rucä. Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has also pointed out that the word brahma-putropamän, meaning "equal to the sons of Brahmä," indicates that the nava-yogendras were on the same spiritual platform as the four exalted Kumära brothers. It has been described in the Fourth Canto that Mahäräja Påthu received the four Kumäras with great love and reverence, and here King Nimi is similarly receiving the nine sons of Lord Åñabhadeva. Receiving exalted Vaiñëavas with love and reverence is standard spiritual etiquette for those who desire progress and happiness in life.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> King Nimi here welcomes the great sages by glorifying their transcendental activities. It is well known that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is transcendental to the three modes of material nature, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä (7.13): mäm ebhyaù param avyayam. Similarly, His pure devotees are also on the transcendental platform. One may ask how such transcendental living beings as the associates of Lord Viñëu could be seen within the material world. Therefore it is stated here, pävanäya caranti hi: the associates of Lord Viñëu travel throughout the universe to reclaim the fallen, conditioned souls on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A representative of the governor may be seen moving within the prison house, but that does not mean that the governor's representative has become a conditioned prisoner. It is understood that he is within the prison to negotiate the possible release of those prisoners who have rectified their criminal propensity. Similarly, the devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead called parivräjakäcäryas wander throughout the universe inviting everyone to surrender to Lord Kåñëa and go back home, back to Godhead, for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge.</div>
<div class="First"> In the Sixth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam the mercy of the associates of Lord Viñëu has been described in connection with the salvation of Ajämila. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has pointed out that the associates of Lord Viñëu are as merciful as the Lord Himself. Even though the ignorant members of human society are not interested in approaching the servants of Lord Viñëu, the devotees of the Lord, without any false prestige, act to liberate the conditioned souls from their perpetual misfortune.</div>

<div class="Translation"> For the conditioned souls, the human body is most difficult to achieve, and it can be lost at any moment. But I think that even those who have achieved human life rarely gain the association of pure devotees, who are dear to the Lord of Vaikuëöha.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, the word dehinäm means bahavo dehä bhavanté yeñäà te, "the conditioned souls, who accept innumerable material bodies." According to some wishful thinkers a living entity in the human form of life will never be degraded to a lower form such as that of an animal or plant. But despite this wishful thinking, it is a fact that according to our activities at the present, we will be elevated or degraded by the laws of God. At the present time in human society there is no clear or precise understanding of the nature of life. Foolish scientists have invented highly sophisticated terminologies and theories to bluff innocent people into believing that life comes from chemical reactions. His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda has exposed this bluff in his book Life Comes From Life, which points out that although scientists claim that life comes from chemicals, they cannot produce so much as an insect, even from unlimited quantities of chemicals. Actually, life and consciousness are symptoms of the spirit soul. In Life Comes From Life (page 43), Çréla Prabhupäda has stated, "Living beings move from one bodily form to another. The forms already exist. The living entity simply transfers himself, just as a man transfers himself from one apartment to another. One apartment is first class, another is second class, and another is third class. Suppose a person comes from a lower-class apartment to a first-class apartment. The person is the same. But now, according to his capacity for payment, or karma, he is able to occupy a higher-class apartment. Real evolution does not mean physical development, but development of consciousness." Within every species of life there is consciousness, and that consciousness is the symptom of the living entity, who is the superior energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Without understanding this essential point of the transmigration of the conscious living entity throughout 8,400,000 species of life, one cannot possibly understand the words durlabho mänuño dehaù, "the human body is very rarely achieved." People are now being cheated of this essential understanding. They are completely unaware of the danger of slipping back into the eight million species that lie below the human species. It is natural that a human being think in terms of progress. We want to feel that our life is progressing and that we are advancing and improving the quality of our life. Therefore, it is urgent that people be informed of the great danger of misusing the valuable human life and that they know of the great opportunity the human life affords, the opportunity to take to Kåñëa consciousness. Just as on earth different residential areas are divided into high class, middle class and low class, within the universe there are upper-class, middle-class and lower-class planets. By practice of the yoga system, or by meticulous execution of religious rituals, one can transfer himself to the higher planets within this universe. On the other hand, by neglecting religious principles one will degrade himself to a lower planet. But the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, declares in Bhagavad-gétä (8.16), äbrahma-bhuvanäl lokäù punar ävartino 'rjuna. Thus the final conclusion is that every planet within the material universe is an unsuitable and inappropriate residence, because on each planet there are the primal defects old age and death. The Lord assures us, however, that in His transcendental abode, which lies far beyond the material cosmos, life is everlasting, blissful and absolutely cognizant. The material world is temporary, troublesome and rife with ignorance, but the spiritual world, called Vaikuëöha, is eternal, blissful and full of perfect knowledge.</div>
<div class="First"> The highly evolved human brain is a gift given by God so that we may use our intelligence to distinguish between that which is eternal and that which is</div>

Learned seers have concluded this by studying the nature of both." Those who have accepted the Supreme Lord and His abode as the ultimate goal of life are called vaikuëöha-priya. Here King Nimi states that to have the personal association of such learned transcendentalists is certainly the perfection of human life. In this connection Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura suggests that we consider the following verse:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nå-deham ädyaà su-labhaà su-durlabhaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">plavaà su-kalpaà guru-karëadhäram</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mayänukülena nabhasvateritaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">pumän bhaväbdhià na taret sa ätma-hä</div>
<div class="First"> "[The Supreme Lord said:] The best of bodies, a human body, is a great attainment, rarely achieved, and may be compared to a boat. The guru is an expert captain for this boat, and I have sent favorable winds (the Vedas). Thus I have given all facilities for crossing over the ocean of material existence. Any human being who has achieved these excellent facilities of human life but does not cross over the material ocean is to be considered the killer of his own self." (SB 11.20.17)</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté, the eternal servants of the Supreme Lord, being controlled by powerful feelings of mercy, descend into the material world as Vaiñëavas to deliver the conditioned souls who are bound by the results of their own mundane work. Such Vaiñëavas also distribute their mercy to those who are laboriously searching after the impersonal Absolute. Çré Närada Muni has stated that without ecstatic love of Godhead such laborious, impersonal contemplation of the Absolute is certainly troublesome (naiñkarmyam apy acyuta-bhäva-varjitam), and what to speak of the innumerable problems of ordinary gross materialistic life. We have practical experience that in the Western countries most people are working hard to get money, laboring under heavenly dreams of sense gratification. Others, having become frustrated with ordinary materialistic life, are trying to negate their personal existence and merge into the existence of God through so-called yoga and meditation. Both classes of unhappy people are receiving the mercy of the Kåñëa consciousness movement, putting aside their dreams of sense gratification as well as their troublesome impersonal speculation. They are learning to chant the holy names of God, dance in ecstasy, and feast on the holy food offered to the Lord. They become enlivened by the transcendental knowledge spoken by the Lord Himself in the Bhagavad-gétä. As the Lord states in Bhagavad-gétä (9.2), susukhaà kartum avyayam. The actual process of spiritual freedom is joyful to perform and has nothing to do with fruitive activities aimed at sense gratification or with dry impersonal speculation. More and more people are taking to the process of Kåñëa consciousness, becoming joyful, and eagerly distributing Kåñëa's mercy to others. Thus the whole world will be enlivened and inspired by the Kåñëa consciousness movement, which is the practical demonstration of the mercy of the Vaiñëavas.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Therefore, O completely sinless ones, I ask you to kindly tell me what the supreme good is. After all, even half a moment's association with pure devotees within this world of birth and death is a priceless treasure for any man.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word çevadhiù, or "a great treasure," is significant in this verse. Just as an ordinary man is overjoyed to discover an unexpected treasure, one who is actually intelligent is overjoyed to gain the association of a pure devotee of the Lord, by which one's life can easily be perfected. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé the words ätyantikaà kñemam, or "the supreme good," indicate that situation in which one cannot be touched by even the slightest fear. Now we are entangled in the cycle of birth, old age, disease and death (saàsäre). Because our entire situation can be devastated in a single moment, we are constantly in fear. But the pure devotees of the Lord can teach us the practical way to free ourselves from material existence and thus to abolish all types of fear.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, normal etiquette would dictate that a host immediately ask a guest who has arrived about his well-being. But such an inquiry is unsuitable to place before self-satisfied devotees of the Lord, who are themselves the bestowers of all well-being. According to Çréla Viçvanätha, the King knew that it would be useless to ask the sages about their business affairs, since the only business of the pure devotees of the Lord is the achievement of the supreme goal of life. According to Bhagavad-gétä, the goal of life is to free oneself from the cycle of birth and death and reinstate oneself as an eternal servant of God on the platform of spiritual bliss. Pure devotees of the Lord do not waste their time with ordinary mundane affairs. Sometimes foolish relatives of a Vaiñëava preacher lament that such a transcendental preacher has not used his life for material business and that so much money has therefore been lost by the practice of spiritual life. Such ignorant persons cannot imagine the unlimited prosperity available on the spiritual platform to those who have surrendered heart and soul to the mission of the Lord. King Nimi was himself a learned Vaiñëava, and therefore he did not foolishly ask the sages about ordinary worldly affairs. He immediately inquired about ätyantikaà kñemam, the highest, most perfect goal of life.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the word anaghäù, "O sinless ones," has two meanings. Anaghäù indicates that the nine Yogendras were themselves completely free of sins. It also indicates that merely by the great fortune of seeing them and hearing from them submissively, an ordinary, sinful man could also be freed of his sins and achieve everything he desired. One might object that since the great sages had just arrived, the King should not have been so impatient as to inquire from them about the perfection of life. Perhaps the King should have waited until the sages themselves invited his inquiry. Such a hypothetical objection is answered by the words kñaëärdho pi. Even a single moment's association with pure devotees, or even half a moment's association, is sufficient to give one the perfection of life. An ordinary person who is offered a great treasure will immediately desire to claim such a treasure. Similarly, King Nimi was thinking, "Why should I consider myself fortunate enough to have such great sages stay here for a long time? Because I am an ordinary person, undoubtedly you will soon be leaving. Therefore, let me immediately take advantage of your holy association." According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté, in this world there are different varieties of mercy. But ordinary mercy cannot bring about the cessation of all unhappiness. In other words, there are many humanitarians, altruists and social reformers who certainly work for the betterment of humanity. Such persons are universally considered merciful. But in spite of their mercy, humanity continues to suffer in the grip of birth, old age, disease and death. I may distribute free food to the needy, but even after eating my merciful gift, the recipient will again become hungry, or he will suffer in some other way. In other words, by mere humanitarianism or altruism, people do not actually become free from unhappiness. Their unhappiness is merely postponed or altered. King Nimi was joyful upon seeing the nava-yogendras because he knew that they were eternally perfect associates of the Supreme Lord. Therefore he thought, "You are not prone to sinful activities like unfortunate mundane people such as me. Thus the words you speak carry no deception or exploitation."</div>
<div class="First"> The materially conditioned souls spend their days and nights discussing various topics of sense gratification. They never find time to hear about transcendental knowledge. But if even only briefly or accidentally they hear hari-kathä, topics of Kåñëa, in the association of pure devotees of the Lord, their propensity to suffer in material existence will slacken. When one sees liberated persons, hears about Kåñëa from them, remembers their saintly behavior and so on, one's tendency to bind himself in the illusion of sense gratification is diminished, and he becomes eager to serve the Supreme Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Within the material world there are two classes of mundane philosophers who present their opinions about the Supreme Lord. Some so-called theologians claim that we are infinitely different from God, and therefore they tend to look upon the Lord as something far beyond our power to understand. Such extreme dualistic philosophers outwardly or officially claim to be pious and religious believers in God, but they consider God so much different from that which is within our experience that according to them there is little profit in even trying to discuss the personality or attributes of the Supreme Lord. Such outwardly faithful persons generally take to fruitive activities and gross materialistic sense gratification, being infatuated with the mundane relationships of the material world, which appear under the headings society, friendship and love.</div>
<div class="First"> The advaita-vädés, or nondualistic philosophers, claim that there is no difference between God and the living entity and that the highest goal of life is to give up our personal existence, which is due to illusion, and merge into the impersonal Brahman effulgence, which is devoid of name, form, paraphernalia and personality. Thus neither class of speculative philosopher is able to understand the transcendental Personality of Godhead. Caitanya Mahäprabhu, in His sublime teaching of</div>
<div class="First"> acintya-bhedäbhedha-tattva, or simultaneous oneness and difference, has clearly demonstrated that we are qualitatively one with God but quantitatively different. God is personal consciousness, and He has His personal form. Similarly we are also personal consciousness, and ultimately, when liberated, we also have eternal forms. The difference is that the eternal form and personality of the Supreme Lord contain unlimited potency and opulence whereas our potency and opulence are infinitesimal. We are conscious of our personal body, whereas Lord Kåñëa, the Absolute Truth, is conscious of everyone's body, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä (kñetra-jïaà cäpi mäà viddhi sarva-kñetreñu bhärata [Bg. 13.3]). But although God is infinitely greater than the living entity, both God and the living entities are eternal personalities with form, activities and feelings.</div>
<div class="First"> The Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, expands Himself into innumerable living entities to enjoy rasas, or ecstatic relationships, with them. The living entities are part and parcel of Lord Kåñëa, and they are meant to serve Him with love. Although the Supreme Lord is eternally the predominator and the living entity is eternally the predominated, when the living entity surrenders unto the Lord with a sincere loving attitude, desiring to serve the Lord eternally without the slightest expectation of personal reward for such service, the Lord immediately is pleased, as expressed here by the word prasannaù. Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is so unlimitedly merciful and magnanimous that in His gratitude to such a surrendered and loving servitor, He is immediately inclined to offer anything, even Himself, to His surrendered devotee.</div>
<div class="First"> There are numerous practical, historical examples of this loving propensity of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because of the love of Mother Yaçodä, child Kåñëa, in His form as Dämodara, surrendered Himself to His loving mother and allowed Himself to be bound with ropes as a childhood punishment. Similarly, feeling indebted to the Päëòavas for their intense love for Him, Kåñëa in His form as Pärtha-särathi happily agreed to drive the chariot of Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra. Similarly, Kåñëa in Våndävana is always thinking of ways to satisfy the gopés, who are universally recognized as the most exalted loving devotees of the Lord. Such intense loving feelings exchanged between the Lord and His pure devotees would not be possible were the living entities not qualitatively one with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and indeed inseparable parts and parcels of the Lord. On the other hand, because both the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entities are eternally individuals, each with his own eternal individual consciousness, such loving exchanges are a perpetual reality in the kingdom of God. In other words, absolute oneness with God and absolute difference from God are theoretical imaginations of different schools of speculative philosophy. The perfection of spiritual love, as described in this verse, is based on simultaneous oneness and difference, and this absolute reality was elaborately presented by Lord Kåñëa Himself in His brahminical incarnation as Caitanya Mahäprabhu. The followers of Caitanya Mahäprabhu have expounded this perfect doctrine in innumerable books, culminating in the teachings of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda, who has most perfectly presented this knowledge in a way that is understandable not only in India but to all the people of the world. Our present insignificant attempt is simply to complete his translation and commentary on Çrémad-Bhägavatam, and we are constantly praying for his guidance so that this work can simply be completed exactly as he would have desired. If one can understand these teachings of Caitanya Mahäprabhu as they are being presented in Western languages, surely the Lord will be satisfied with such a sincere seeker of spiritual truth.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In the opinion of Çréla Çrédhara Svämé the word asad-ätma-bhävät in this verse indicates that the living entity is constantly disturbed by fear because he identifies his eternal self with the temporary material body and its paraphernalia. Similarly, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has stated, bhakti-pratiküla-deha-gehädiñv äsaktim. Because of one's attachment to one's temporary body and so-called home, family, friends and so on, one's intelligence is always disturbed by fear, and one is unable to appreciate or practice pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord. So-called religious activities executed in the bodily conception of life are always accompanied by fear and anxiety about the ultimate result. But pure devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead frees one from fear and anxiety because it is executed on the platform of Vaikuëöha, or the spiritual plane, where there is no fear or anxiety. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the process of bhakti-yoga is so powerful that even in the stage of sädhana-bhakti, in which one is practicing devotional service through rules and regulations, the neophyte can have a direct experience of fearlessness by the mercy of the Lord. As one's devotional service becomes mature, the Lord reveals Himself to the devotee, and all fear is totally vanquished forever.</div>
<div class="First"> Every living entity has a natural propensity to serve God, but because of false identification with the temporary body one loses touch with this pure, constitutional propensity and instead inauspiciously becomes attached to temporary sense gratification in the form of body, home, family and so on. The result of such false attachment is continuing distress, which can be eradicated only by devotional service to the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> In this connection, Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté has quoted the following verse:</div>

They always try to protect wealth, body and friends, they are filled with lamentation and unlawful desires and paraphernalia, and they avariciously base their undertakings on the perishable conceptions of 'I' and 'mine.' As long as they do not take shelter of Your safe lotus feet, they are full of such anxieties." (SB 3.9.6)</div>

<div class="Translation"> Even ignorant living entities can very easily come to know the Supreme Lord if they adopt those means prescribed by the Supreme Lord Himself. The process recommended by the Lord is to be known as bhägavata-dharma, or devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> There are many Vedic scriptures, such as Manu-saàhitä, that present standard injunctions for the peaceful management of human society. Such Vedic knowledge is based on the varëäçrama system, which scientifically divides human society into four occupational divisions as well as four spiritual divisions. According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, however, knowledge that can bring one directly in contact with the Supreme Personality of Godhead is called ati-rahasyam, or the most confidential knowledge (ati-rahasyatvät sva-mukhenaiva bhagavatäviduñäm api puàsäm aïjaù sukhenaivätma-labdhaye). Bhägavata-dharma is so confidential that it is spoken by the Lord Himself. The essence of bhägavata-dharma is given in Bhagavad-gétä, wherein Kåñëa personally instructs Arjuna. Yet in the Eleventh Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam the Lord will give instructions to Uddhava that surpass even the teachings given to Arjuna in Bhagavad-gétä. As Çréla Prabhupäda has stated, "Undoubtedly Bhagavad-gétä was spoken by the Lord on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra just to encourage Arjuna to fight, and yet to complete the transcendental knowledge of Bhagavad-gétä the Lord instructed Uddhava. The Lord wanted Uddhava to fulfill His mission and disseminate knowledge which He had not spoken even in Bhagavad-gétä." (SB 3.4.32 purport) Similarly, it is understood that the knowledge that will be presented here by the nine Yogendras is not their personal concoction but is authorized knowledge originally spoken by the Lord Himself.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté, the living entities, in the course of their wanderings throughout the cycle of birth and death, lose all trace of the Personality of Godhead. But when they hear the eternally auspicious topics spoken by the Supreme Lord for their benefit and understand their eternal identities as spirit souls, the realized experience of being an eternal servant of Kåñëa becomes the basis of bhägavata-dharma. In the soul's experience as a pure Vaiñëava, or servant of God, there is no consideration of being different from God or the same as God, nor is one interested in the kingdom of material sense gratification. The pure devotee simply perceives his particular devotional service to the Supreme Lord and sees himself as an individual part and parcel of the ultimate shelter. A pure devotee experiences that his very being is tied, by ropes of loving devotion, to the ultimate shelter Himself in one of His direct personal expansions. And in such a perfect state of consciousness, the devotee can perceive the all-pervading variegated forms of the Absolute Truth.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, the word aïjaù ("easily"), which is used in the previous verse, is explained in this verse. He states, aïjaù-padenoktaà su-karatvaà vivåëoti: "By the word aïjaù the ease of performing bhakti-yoga is established, and this will be elaborated in the present verse." In Bhagavad-gétä (9.2) the Lord Himself states, pratyakñävagamaà dharmyaà susukhaà kartum avyayam: "The process of devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternal, and it is very joyfully and naturally performed." Çréla Prabhupäda comments, "The process of devotional service is a very happy one. Why? Devotional service consists of çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù [SB 7.5.23], so one can simply hear the chanting of the glories of the Lord or can attend philosophical lectures on transcendental knowledge given by authorized äcäryas. Simply by sitting, one can learn; then one can eat the remnants of the food offered to God, nice palatable dishes. In every state devotional service is joyful. One can execute devotional service even in the most poverty-stricken condition. The Lord says, patraà puñpaà phalam: He is ready to accept from the devotee any kind of offering, never mind what. Even a leaf, a flower, a bit of fruit or a little water, which are all available in every part of the world, can be offered by any person, regardless of social position, and will be accepted if offered with love. There are many instances of this in history. Simply by tasting the tulasé leaves offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, great sages like Sanat-kumära became great devotees. Therefore the devotional process is very nice, and it can be executed in a happy mood. God accepts only the love with which things are offered to Him."</div>
<div class="First"> The essential point to be understood here is that when a living entity surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he tells the Lord, "My dear Lord, although I am most sinful and unqualified and for so long have been trying to forget You, now I am taking shelter at Your lotus feet. From this day on I am Yours. Whatever I possess—my body, mind, words, family, riches—I am now offering at Your lotus feet. Please do with me as You like." The Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, has repeatedly given assurance in Bhagavad-gétä that He will protect and redeem such a surrendered living entity, bringing him back home, back to Godhead, for an eternal life in the Lord's own kingdom. Thus the qualification of surrendering to the Lord is so great and spiritually potent that even if a surrendered soul is deficient in other aspects of pious life, his elevated status is protected by the Lord Himself. In other processes, however, such as yoga, because one depends upon his own determination and intelligence and does not actually seek shelter of the Lord, one is subject to fall at any moment, being protected only by one's own flimsy, limited potency. Therefore, as stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (10.2.32), äruhya kåcchreëa paraà padaà tataù/ patanty adho 'nädåta-yuñmad-aìghrayaù: if one gives up the shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord and instead tries to advance in the yoga process by one's own determination, or if one tries to make progress in knowledge by one's own speculative power, surely one will eventually fall again to a mediocre material platform, having no protection other than one's own fallible strength. Therefore the Vaiñëava äcäryas, in their commentaries on this verse, have illustrated in various ways the vast superiority of bhakti-yoga, or pure devotional service. In this connection, Çrédhara Svämé states, nimélya netre dhävann api iha eñu bhägavata-dharmeñu na skhalet. nimélanaà nämäjïänaà, yathähuù-'çruti-småté ubhe netre vipräëäà parikértite/ ekena vikalaù käëo dväbhyäm andhaù prakértitaù' iti. "Even if running with both eyes closed, a devotee on this path of bhägavata-dharma will not stumble. 'Closing one's eyes' refers to being in ignorance [of standard Vedic literatures]. As it is said, 'The çruti and småti scriptures are the two eyes of the brähmaëas. Lacking one of them, a brähmaëa is half blind, and deprived of both he is considered completely blind.' "</div>
<div class="First"> In Bhagavad-gétä (10.10-11) the Lord has clearly stated that even if a devotee is lacking in Vedic knowledge or ignorant of Vaiñëava literature, the Lord personally enlightens him from within his heart if the devotee is actually engaged in loving service to the Lord. In this connection, Çréla Prabhupäda states, "When Lord Caitanya was in Benares promulgating the chanting of Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, thousands of people were following Him. Prakäçänanda, a very influential and learned scholar in Benares at that time, derided Lord Caitanya for being a sentimentalist. Sometimes philosophers criticize the devotees because they think that most of the devotees are in the darkness of ignorance and are philosophically naive sentimentalists. Actually that is not the fact. There are very, very learned scholars who have put forward the philosophy of devotion, but even if a devotee does not take advantage of their literatures or of his spiritual master, if he is sincere in his devotional service he is helped by Kåñëa Himself within his heart. So the sincere devotee engaged in Kåñëa consciousness cannot be without knowledge. The only qualification is that one carry out devotional service in full Kåñëa consciousness."</div>
<div class="First"> Yet this facility given by the Lord cannot justify unauthorized concoctions put forward about the process of devotional service in the name of spontaneous devotion. In this connection Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has stated, bhagavat-präpty-arthaà påthäì-märga-karaëaà tv ati-düñaëävaham eva: "If one manufactures his own process of devotional service for the sake of attaining the Supreme Lord, such a concoction will cause total ruination." Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura goes on to quote:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">çruti-småti-puräëädipaïcarätra-</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">vidhià vinä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">aikäntiké harer bhaktir</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">utpätäyaiva kalpate</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">[Brs. 1.2.101(90)]</div>
<div class="First"> "If one's so-called unalloyed devotion to Lord Hari does not take into account the regulations of the çruti, småti, Puräëas and Païcarätra, it is nothing more than a disturbance to society." In other words, even if one is not learned in the Vedic literatures, if he is engaged in the loving service of the Lord he is to be accepted as a pure devotee; nonetheless, such loving devotion cannot in any way contradict the injunctions of revealed scriptures. Such groups as the präkåta-sahajiyäs ignore the standard regulations of Vaiñëava dharma and engage in illicit, degraded activities, dressing as Rädhä and Kåñëa in the name of spontaneous devotion. They claim that because such spontaneous devotion is revealed by the Lord Himself, they need not refer to standard scriptures. Similarly, all over the world there are pseudoreligionists who manufacture their own processes and claim they are receiving knowledge from the Lord Himself within their hearts. Therefore it is very important to understand, as stated here, that spontaneous revelation by the Lord within the heart is meant not to alter the eternal process of devotional service to the Lord, but to give a supplementary facility to a sincere devotee who is ignorant of revealed scriptures. In other words, the revealed scriptures describe the eternal process of service to the Lord. Since the Lord is eternal and the living entity is eternal, the process of their loving relationship is also eternal. The Lord never changes His essential nature, nor does the living entity. Therefore there is no need to change the essential process of loving service to the Lord. Special revelation by the Lord is meant to give scriptural knowledge by another means, and not to contradict scriptural knowledge. On the other hand, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has stated that if a devotee is executing all the basic principles of bhakti-yoga and advancing in devotional service, such a Vaiñëava should not be criticized for neglecting the secondary procedures. For example, His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda established hundreds of spiritual communities in the Western countries for practicing Kåñëa consciousness. The devotees in these communities give up all illicit sex, gambling, intoxication and meat-eating and constantly engage in service to Kåñëa. Such followers of Çréla Prabhupäda are able to make wonderful spiritual advancement and convert many thousands of people to the process of devotional service. In fact, all the faithful members of ISKCON who follow the standard regulations remain free from material contamination and make visible progress in going back home, back to Godhead. Such members of ISKCON cannot possibly execute all the details of the varëäçrama-dharma system. In fact, many Western devotees can barely pronounce Sanskrit words and are not very expert in performing elaborate sacrifices based on chanting of mantras and offering of oblations. But because they are executing all the essential principles of bhakti-yoga by giving up material sense gratification and constantly engaging in loving service to Kåñëa, their position is guaranteed both in this life and in the next. We have seen many sophisticated Sanskrit scholars and learned experts in the details of Vedic sacrifice who can hardly even follow the basic principles of human life, namely no illicit sex, no meat-eating, no gambling and no intoxication. Such brilliant scholars and ritualistic performers are generally seen to be attached to a materialistic conception of life and are fond of mental speculation. Although in Bhagavad-gétä the Lord Himself has given perfect knowledge for all time, such so-called scholars consider themselves more intelligent than the Lord and thus speculate on the meaning of Vedic literature. Such speculation certainly constitutes a fall from perfect spiritual life, and what then is to be said of materialistic fruitive activities, which are illusory in every sense of the term. The transcendental devotees are able to remain aloof from the pollution of fruitive activity and mental speculation, and that is the essential purport of this verse.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has warned that the words yän ästhäya indicate that the exalted status of a Vaiñëava can never be accorded to one who is not following the basic regulations of bhakti-yoga. Nor can it apply to one who is sometimes serving Kåñëa and sometimes serving the illusory energy, mäyä, by mental speculation or fruitive activities. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has concluded, "In all dharmas other than bhägavata-dharma one must consider the conditioned soul's qualification. But a soul surrendered to the Lord is never confounded by error, even if unqualified in all other respects. His feet never stumble, and he never falls. Even though wandering in the world at whim, he always resides in an auspicious place by the influence of his unswerving worship. The unique potency of bhagavata-dharma does not appear in any of the other dharmas of the world. There is no comparison between a surrendered individual who has taken shelter of bhägavata-dharma and the practitioner of any other dharma."</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has commented in this regard that a person who engages all the sensory activities of his body, mind, words, intelligence, ego and consciousness in the service of the Supreme Lord cannot be considered to be on the same level as a karmé working for his personal sense gratification. Although apparently still a conditioned soul, one who offers the fruits of all his activities to the Lord can no longer be touched by the countless miseries that arise from the reactions to materialistic activities. Because of enmity against the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His omnipotent authority, the conditioned living entity performs activities against the order of the Lord. Yet self-realized souls continue to perform all types of work within this world to carry out the mission of the Supreme Lord. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, those karmés who are sufficiently pious follow the example of the self-realized souls by trying to offer the fruits of their own duties at the lotus feet of the Lord. Although this is counted as karma-miçrä bhakti, or devotional service mixed with the desire to execute fruitive activities, such mixed devotional service is gradually transformed into pure devotional service. As the pious fruitive workers disengage themselves, step by step, from the bogus philosophy of "enjoyment of one's hard-earned rewards," pure devotional service rewards them with complete good fortune.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has commented, ätmanä cittenähaìkäreëa vä anusåto yaù svabhävas tasmät: although one may still be in the bodily concept of life, he should offer the fruit of his work to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Those with a primitive, materialistic concept of the Supreme Lord consider the Lord present only in a temple or church. They make some offering to the Lord in the place of worship, but in their normal activities they claim proprietorship, not thinking that God is present everywhere and within everyone. We have practical experience of many so-called religious men who become very offended if their children try to become servants of the Supreme Lord. They feel, "God should be pleased with whatever humble offering I give Him, but my family and ordinary business affairs belong to me and are under my control." The perception of anything as separate from the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His proprietorship is called mäyä, or illusion. Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has quoted, na kevalaà vidhitaù kåtam eveti niyamaù; svabhävänusäri laukikam api: "The regulation that one should serve the Supreme Lord does not refer only to prescribed religious paths, ceremonies and regulations; rather, all the activities one performs in this world according to one's personal nature should be dedicated to the Supreme Personality of Godhead."</div>
<div class="First"> The words karoti yad yat sakalaà parasmai näräyaëäyeti samarpayet tat in this verse are very significant. A similar verse is found in Bhagavad-gétä (9.27):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yat karoñi yad açnäsi</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yaj juhoñi dadäsi yat</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yat tapasyasi kaunteya</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tat kuruñva mad-arpaëam</div>
<div class="First"> "O son of Kunté, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and give away, and all the austerities that you perform should be done as an offering unto Me." The objection may be raised, Since our ordinary activities are performed with a material body and material mind, not by the spirit soul, how can such activities be offered to the Supreme Lord, who is completely transcendental to the material world? How can such activities be considered spiritual? In answer to this it is stated in the Viñëu Puräëa (3.8.8):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">varëäçramäcära-vatä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">puruñeëa paraù pumän</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">viñëur ärädhyate panthä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nänyat tat-toña-käraëam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">[Cc. Madhya 8.58]</div>
<div class="First"> One who wants to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu, must accept the system of varëäçrama-dharma and worship the Lord through the execution of his prescribed duties. In Bhagavad-gétä (4.13) the Supreme Lord has personally taken credit for establishing the system of varëäçrama-dharma: cätur-varëyaà mayä såñöaà guëa-karma-vibhägaçaù. Therefore if one offers his work within the varëäçrama-dharma system to the Supreme Lord, such work is counted as devotional service. According to one's svabhäva, or nature, one may work as an intellectual or priest, as an administrator or military man, as an agriculturist or mercantile man, or as a laborer or craftsman. And while working, everyone should meditate on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, thinking, yat sakalaà parasmai näräyaëäya: "I am working for the Supreme Lord. Whatever result comes from my work, I shall accept the bare minimum for my personal maintenance, and the rest I shall offer for the glorification of Lord Näräyaëa."</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has pointed out, käminäà tu sarvathaiva na duñkarmärpaëam: one cannot offer duñkarma, or sinful, wicked activities, to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The four pillars of sinful life are illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling and intoxication. Such activities are never acceptable as offerings to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The example may be given that although in a free society each person is allowed to choose his own occupation, even a democratic government will not allow a citizen to choose the occupation of thief or murderer. In the same way, according to the laws of God one is invited to work according to his own nature in the varëäçrama system, but one is forbidden to adopt a criminal life of sinful activities violating the laws of God.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has given a nice description of how one should offer one's ordinary activities to the Supreme Lord. He says that an ordinary sense gratifier begins his activities in the morning by passing stool and urine, cleaning his mouth, brushing his teeth, bathing, meeting his friends and family members and discussing with them the day's business. In this way one has so many activities during the day, and a sense gratifier executes all these activities for his personal material enjoyment. A karmé, on the other hand, working under the jurisdiction of the karma-käëòa section of the Vedas, will perform the same activities for the pleasure of the demigods and his forefathers. Thus, according to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, a devotee of the Supreme Lord, Näräyaëa, should similarly perform all of his daily activities for the pleasure of the Supreme Lord. In this way everything we do throughout the day will become bhakty-aìga, or a supplementary aspect of our devotional service to Kåñëa.</div>
<div class="First"> It should be understood that as long as one identifies oneself in terms of the varëäçrama-dharma system rather than as part and parcel of Kåñëa one is still on the platform of ahaìkära, or false ego, because the varëäçrama system is designed according to the modes of nature acquired by the living entity through his material body. But the äcäryas have emphasized in their commentaries on this verse that such a false ego, by which one identifies oneself as a brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya, çüdra, sannyäsé, gåhastha and so on, should also be offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, when one becomes very much attracted to hearing and chanting about the Supreme Lord and not merely offering Him the fruits of one's work, one has attained the stage called svarüpa-siddhä bhakti, or the stage in which actual devotion becomes visible. The example may be given that although any good citizen will pay his taxes to the government, he may not necessarily love the government or its leaders. Similarly a pious living entity can understand that he is working under the laws of God, and therefore in accordance with Vedic injunctions or the injunctions of other scriptures he offers a portion of his assets to the Supreme Lord in religious ceremonies. But when such a pious person actually becomes attached to chanting and hearing about the personal qualities of the Lord and when love thus becomes visible, he is considered to be reaching the mature stage of life. In this regard, Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has quoted several verses that very nicely show the development of love for Godhead. Anena durväsanä-duùkha-darçanena sa karuëä-mayaù karuëäà karotu: "May the merciful Lord show mercy on me by demonstrating the misery created by sinful desires." Yä prétir avivekänäà visayeñv anapäyiné/ tväm anusmarataù sä me hådayän näpasarpatu: "Unintelligent persons have unflinching affection for the objects of sense gratification. Similarly, may I always remember You, so that that same attachment, applied to You, never leaves my heart." (Viñëu Puräëa 1.20.19) Yuvaténäà yathä yüni yünäà ca yuvatau yathä/ mano 'bhiramate tadvan mano me ramatäà tvayi: "As the minds of young girls take pleasure in thinking of a young boy and those of young boys take pleasure in thinking of a young girl, may my mind take pleasure in You." Mama sukarmaëi duñkarmaëi ca yad räga-sämänyam, tad sarvato-bhävena bhagavad-viñayam eva bhavatu: "Whatever attraction I have for pious or sinful activities, let that attraction be wholeheartedly invested in You."</div>

<div class="Translation"> Fear arises when a living entity misidentifies himself as the material body because of absorption in the external, illusory energy of the Lord. When the living entity thus turns away from the Supreme Lord, he also forgets his own constitutional position as a servant of the Lord. This bewildering, fearful condition is effected by the potency for illusion, called mäyä. Therefore, an intelligent person should engage unflinchingly in the unalloyed devotional service of the Lord, under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, whom he should accept as his worshipable deity and as his very life and soul.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé the objection may be raised that since fear is caused by ignorance, it can be dispelled by knowledge and there is no need to worship the Supreme Lord. The living entity falsely identifies with his material body, family, society and so on, and he simply has to give up this false identification. Then what will mäyä be able to do?</div>
<div class="First"> In reply to this argument, Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has quoted the following verse from Bhagavad-gétä (7.14):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">daivé hy eñä guëa-mayé</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mama mäyä duratyayä</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">mäyäm etäà taranti te</div>
<div class="First"> "This divine energy of Mine consisting of the three modes of material nature is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it." The living entity, called jéva-tattva, is one of the potencies of the Supreme Lord, but the constitutional position of the living entity is taöa-stha, or marginal. Being minute, every living entity is eternally dependent upon the supreme living entity, Kåñëa. This is confirmed in the Vedic literature as follows: nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäà/ eko bahünäà yo vidadhäti kämän. "Among all the eternally conscious beings there is one supreme eternal living being who is supplying the needs of all the innumerable others." (Kaöha Upaniñad 2.1.12) Kåñëadäsa Kaviräja has stated, ekale éçvara kåñëa, ära saba bhåtya: "Kåñëa is the only independent controller; all other living entities depend upon Him." (Cc. Ädi 5.142) Just as the finger is part and parcel of the body and therefore must always be engaged in bodily service, we as parts and parcels of Kåñëa (mamaiväàço jéva-loke jéva-bhütaù sanätanaù [Bg. 15.7]) have the eternal duty (sanätana-dharma) of engaging in the unalloyed service of the Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> The potency of the Lord that enlightens us in the Lord's service is called cit-çakti. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura comments that when the living entity develops a spirit of independence he is forced to come to the material world, where he enters into various types of petty and undesirable behavior that create a fearful situation for him. The bahiraìgä-çakti, the illusory potency of the Supreme Lord, covers all trace of the cit-çakti and imposes one material body after another upon the living entity for his gross sinful enjoyment. As further punishment, the living entity who has given up his loving relationship with Kåñëa loses all power to perceive the eternal, blissful form of the Supreme Lord, who is his actual shelter. Instead the living entity becomes attached to many temporary, phantasmagorical forms, such as his personal body, the bodies of his family members and friends, his nation, his city, with its buildings and cars, and innumerable types of ephemeral material scenery. In such a state of gross ignorance the idea of returning to one's original identity no longer even crosses the mind.</div>
<div class="First"> By the laws of God the three modes of material nature are constantly in conflict, as stated in the Bhagavad-gétä. This conflict is described in many places in the Bhägavatam as guëa-vyatikaram. When the living entity is bewildered by the interactions of the modes of material nature, he comes to the conclusion of relativity and assumes that God and worship of God are simply by-products of the relative, contradictory interactions of nature's modes. In the name of anthropological, sociological or psychological perspective, the living entity falls deeper and deeper into the darkness of materialistic ignorance, dedicating himself to mundane piety, economic development, sense gratification, or speculation in which he regards the Absolute as lacking variety and personality, which he assumes to be products of the interactions of nature's modes.</div>
<div class="First"> The illusory potency of the Supreme Lord is duratyayä; it is impossible to escape without the direct mercy of Kåñëa (mäm eva ye prapadyante mäyäm etäà taranti te [Bg. 7.14]). The example may be given that when the sun is covered by clouds, no man-made apparatus can remove them from the sky, but the sun itself, which created the clouds, can immediately burn away the cloudy covering and reveal itself. Similarly, when we become covered by the illusory potency of the Lord we identify with our temporary material body, and thus we are always in fear and anxiety. But when we surrender to the Lord Himself, He can immediately free us from this illusion. The material world is padaà padaà yad vipadäm; [SB 10.14.58] it is dangerous at every step. When a living entity understands that he is not the material body but an eternal servant of God, his fear is vanquished. As stated by Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, atra bhaktaiù saàsära-bandhän na bhetavyaà sa hi bhaktau pravartamänasya svata eväpayäti: "In this bhägavata-dharma devotees have no need to fear the bondage of material existence. That fear goes away of its own accord for one who engages in devotional service."</div>
<div class="First"> It is important to make clear that bhayam, or fear, cannot ultimately be vanquished simply by impersonal self-realization as expressed by the words ahaà brahmäsmi(91), "I am spirit soul." In Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.5.12) Närada Muni says to Vyäsadeva, naiñkarmyam apy acyuta-bhäva-varjitaà na çobhate: mere naiñkarmyam, or cessation of material activities and repudiation of the bodily concept of life, cannot ultimately save one. The living entity must find a superior shelter on the spiritual platform; otherwise he will come back to the fearful situation of material existence. That is stated in çästra: äruhya kåcchreëa paraà padaà tataù patanty adho 'nädåta-yuñmad-aìghrayaù (SB 10.2.32). Although one may with great labor and effort struggle up to the Brahman platform (kleço 'dhikataras teñäm avyaktäsakta-cetasäm [Bg. 12.5]), if he does not find a suitable shelter he will come back to the material platform. His so-called liberation is vimukta-mäna, liberation by imagination. The living entity is by nature pleasure-seeking, änanda-maya. Now we are suffering because we are falsely seeking pleasure on the material platform and as a result we are becoming entangled in the painful complexities of material existence. But if we try to give up the pleasure-seeking propensity altogether, we shall eventually become frustrated and return to the platform of material pleasure-seeking. Although there is eternal existence on the Brahman platform of impersonal realization, there is no änanda. Variety is the mother of enjoyment. In the Vaikuëöha planets there is actual, spiritual änanda. Kåñëa is there in His ecstatic, spiritual form, surrounded by His blissful associates, all of them eternally full of bliss and knowledge. They have nothing to do with material existence. In the spiritual planets even the scenery and birds and animals are fully conscious of Kåñëa and are absorbed in transcendental bliss. Yad gatvä na nivartante tad dhäma paramaà mama (Bg. 15.6). One who goes to the blissful, spiritual planet of Kåñëa will be fully satisfied and never come back to the material platform. Therefore Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has said, kià cätra bhaktaiù saàsära-bandhän na bhetavyam. Only the bhakta actually becomes free from fear.</div>
<div class="First"> In this connection Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has emphasized the necessity of accepting a bona fide spiritual master who is vrajendranandana-preñöha, the dearmost servitor of the son of Nanda Mahäräja, Kåñëa. The bona fide spiritual master is completely free from envy of other living entities, and therefore he freely distributes knowledge of devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When the living entities who are inimical to the service of the Lord somehow hear this knowledge submissively, they become free from the illusory potency of the Lord, which has covered them and thrown them into various miserable species of life. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, by the mercy of the spiritual master the faithful disciple gradually realizes the transcendental position of Lord Näräyaëa, who is served with great awe and reverence by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune. As the disciple's transcendental knowledge gradually increases, even the paramaiçvarya, or supreme opulence, of the Lord of Vaikuëöha becomes pale in the light of the beauty of Govinda, Kåñëa. Govinda has inconceivable potency to enchant and give pleasure, and by the mercy of the spiritual master the disciple gradually develops his own blissful relationship (rasa) with Govinda. Having understood the blissful pastimes of Lakñmé-Näräyaëa, Çré Sétä-Räma, Rukmiëé-Dvärakädhéça and finally Lord Kåñëa Himself, the purified living entity is given the unique privilege of participating directly in the devotional service of Kåñëa, who becomes his only object and shelter.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Although the duality of the material world does not ultimately exist, the conditioned soul experiences it as real under the influence of his own conditioned intelligence. This imaginary experience of a world separate from Kåñëa can be compared to the acts of dreaming and desiring. When the conditioned soul dreams at night of something desirable or horrible, or when he daydreams of what he would like to have or avoid, he creates a reality that has no existence beyond his own imagination. The tendency of the mind is to accept and reject various activities based on sense gratification. Therefore an intelligent person should control the mind, restricting it from the illusion of seeing things separate from Kåñëa, and when the mind is thus controlled he will experience actual fearlessness.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Although the conditioned mind is bewildered by the objects of sense gratification offered by mäyä, illusion, if one takes to the unalloyed devotional service of the Lord such material sense gratification gradually dissipates, for it is merely a mental concoction of the conditioned soul. Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has emphasized by the words avyabhicäriëé bhakti that one cannot dissipate the illusion of material sense gratification unless one takes to the unalloyed devotional service of the Lord. As Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé has stated:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">anyäbhiläñitä-çünyaà</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">[Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 1.1.11(92)]</div>
<div class="First"> Unalloyed devotional service cannot be mixed with material sense gratification or mental speculation. The servant must act only for the satisfaction of the master. Similarly, Lord Kåñëa states in Bhagavad-gétä, mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja. One must see only Kåñëa everywhere and must act exclusively for the satisfaction of Lord Kåñëa, the eternal master of every living entity.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted several verses from the Hari-vaàça illustrating that the living entity bewildered by identifying with his material body, home, family, friends and so on and thus entangled in the cycle of birth and death accepts phantasmagoria as reality. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, çravaëa-kértanädi-lakñaëa-mätratvaà yato na vyähanyeta: if one seriously desires to vanquish the duality of material illusion, one must adopt the process of chanting and hearing the glories of the Supreme Lord. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu also cited the following Vedic reference:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">harer näma harer näma</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">harer nämaiva kevalam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kalau nästy eva nästy eva</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">[Cc. Ädi 17.21]</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">(Båhan-näradéya Puräëa)</div>
<div class="First"> According to Vedic literatures the living entities of this Kali-yuga are very feeble in their power to understand spiritual knowledge (mandäù sumanda-matayo manda-bhägyä hy upadrutäù [SB 1.1.10]). Their minds are always disturbed. and they are lazy and misguided by so many bogus leaders. They are further described in the Bhägavatam as niùsattvän (impatient and impious). durmedhän (possessed of weak intelligence) and hrasitäyuñaù (very short lived). Therefore one who seriously wants to overcome the ignorance of material life must surrender to the process of chanting and hearing the holy name of the Lord—Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare—as well as reciting and rendering submissive aural reception to the transcendental literatures presented by the Lord, such as Bhagavad-gétä, Çrémad-Bhägavatam and Caitanya-caritämåta. It should be understood that the living entity is completely spiritual and never actually becomes mixed with material energy (asaìgo hy ayaà puruñaù). According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, tasmin çuddhe 'pi kalpyate: although the living entity is çuddha, pure spirit soul, he imagines that he is a material creation and thus entangles himself in the network of illusion called dehäpatya-kalaträdi [SB 2.1.4].</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has used the word mänasa-pratyakña to describe the experience of material life. Mänasa-pratyakña means "that which is experienced only within the mind." The actual pratyakña is described in Bhagavad-gétä (9.2):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">räja-vidyä räja-guhyaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">pavitram idam uttamam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">pratyakñävagamaà dharmyaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">susukhaà kartum avyayam</div>
<div class="First"> When one submissively hears the instructions given by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gétä, which constitute the king of all knowledge (räja-vidyä) and the most confidential of all information (räja-guhyam), by associating with such spotless spiritual knowledge (pavitram idam uttamam) one can directly experience one's eternal nature (pratyakñävagamam). By experiencing one's eternal nature, one becomes thoroughly religious (dharmyam), blissful (susukham) and eternally engaged in the devotional service of the Lord (kartum avyayam).</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has quoted the following çruti-mantra in this connection: vijita-håñéka-väyubhir adänta-manas turagam. "By the very senses and life air one has conquered, the uncurbed mind will again drag one away." According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura the meaning of this verse is samavahäya guroç caraëam: if one rejects the lotus feet of one's spiritual master, all of one's previous spiritual advancement becomes null and void. This has already been indicated in the previous verse by the words guru-devatätmä. Unless one accepts a bona fide spiritual master in the authorized paramparä as one's worshipable deity and life and soul, there is no question of overcoming the duality of material life.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has made the following comments on this verse. "Control of the mind is a result of living a life of devotional service to the Lord. By the influence of fixed devotional service, the accepting and rejecting mind can stop its thirst for sensory enjoyment apart from Kåñëa. In transcendental Kåñëa consciousness there is no contradiction, pettiness or lack of ecstasy. In other words, it is not like a material object, which always proves temporary and constantly miserable. Having forgotten Kåñëa, the conditioned living entity is suffering the misdirection and perversion of his own so-called intelligence. The living entities are fragmental parts of the supreme shelter, Kåñëa, but have fallen from Kåñëa's kingdom of spiritual pastimes. Because of forgetting the Supreme Lord, they become prone to sinful life and turn their attention to dangerous material objects, which fill them with constant fear. If one desires to subdue the mind, which is constantly engaged in the duality of mental concoction, one must take to the devotional service of Lord Kåñëa."</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> An intelligent person who has controlled his mind and conquered fear should give up all attachment to material objects such as wife, family and nation and should wander freely without embarrassment, hearing and chanting the holy names of the Lord, the bearer of the chariot wheel. The holy names of Kåñëa are all-auspicious because they describe His transcendental birth and activities, which He performs within this world for the salvation of the conditioned souls. Thus the holy names of the Lord are sung throughout the world.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Since the holy names, forms and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are unlimited, no one can hear or chant about all of them. Therefore the word loke indicates that one should chant the holy names of the Lord that are well known on this particular planet. Within this world, Lord Räma and Lord Kåñëa are very famous. Their books, Rämäyaëa and Bhagavad-gétä, are studied and relished all over the world. Similarly, Caitanya Mahäprabhu is gradually becoming famous all over the world, as He Himself predicted. Påthivéte äche yata nagarädi gräma/ sarvatra pracära haibe mora näma: "In every town and village on this earth the glories of My name will be chanted." Therefore in conformity with the authorized statement of this verse of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, the Kåñëa consciousness movement emphasizes the mahä-mantra—Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare—along with the Païca-tattva mahä-mantra—çré-kåñëa-caitanya prabhu-nityänanda çré-advaita gadädhara çréväsädi-gaura-bhakta-vånda.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, this blissful process of chanting the holy names of the Lord without any material conception is called sugamaà märgam, a very enjoyable path. Similarly, Lord Kåñëa has described the process of bhakti-yoga as susukhaà kartum, very joyfully performed, and Çréla Locana däsa Öhäkura has sung, saba avatära sära çiromaëi kevala änanda-käëòa. Caitanya Mahäprabhu's process for worshiping Kåñëa is kevala änanda-käëòa, simply joyful. In this connection Çréla Prabhupäda has stated that people in any part of the world can assemble, chant the Hare Kåñëa mantra, read from authorized books such as Bhagavad-gétä As It Is, and accept kåñëa-prasädam sumptuously, just as Caitanya Mahäprabhu did in Navadvépa. To be successful in this program, however, Locana däsa Öhäkura has warned, viñaya chäòiyä: one must give up material sense gratification. If one indulges in material sense gratification, surely he will be in the bodily concept of life. One who is in the bodily concept of life will undoubtedly have a materialistic understanding of the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus, by considering the Lord's pastimes mundane, one will come within the category of Mäyäväda, or impersonalism, in which one considers the transcendental body of the Lord to be a creation of material nature. Therefore the word asaìgaù in this verse is very significant. One must chant the holy name of the Lord without mental speculation. One must accept Lord Kåñëa as He presents Himself in Bhagavad-gétä, wherein He states that He alone is Puruñottama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and that His transcendental form is eternal (ajo 'pi sann avyayätmä). Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has emphasized, yäni çästra-dvärä sat-paramparä-dvärä ca loke gétäni janmäni karmäëi ca, täni çåëvan gäyaàç ca: if one wants to be successful in chanting and hearing the holy name of the Lord, one must adopt the process as it is coming down in the sat-paramparä, the transcendental disciplic succession. And the sat-paramparä can be identified by reference to bona fide Vedic scriptures. Contrary to the opinion of uninformed critics, the followers of Kåñëa consciousness are not mindless or fanatical. They intelligently follow the system of checks and balances called guru, sädhu and çästra. That is, one must accept a bona fide spiritual master, who must in turn be confirmed by the opinion of great saintly persons and revealed scriptures. If one accepts a bona fide spiritual master, follows the example of great saintly persons and becomes conversant with authorized literature such as Bhagavad-gétä As It Is and Çrémad-Bhägavatam, one's program of chanting the holy names of the Lord and hearing about the Lord's pastimes will be completely successful. As Kåñëa states in Bhagavad-gétä (4.9):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">janma karma ca me divyam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">evaà yo vetti tattvataù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tyaktvä dehaà punar janma</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">naiti mäm eti so 'rjuna</div>
<div class="First"> "One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in the material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna."</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has stated that throughout the world the Supreme Lord is known by many names, some of them expressed in vernacular language, but any name used to indicate the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is one without a second, beyond the influence of material nature, can be accepted as a holy name of God, according to this verse. That is indicated by the word loke.</div>
<div class="First"> One should not misinterpret the word vicaret, "one should wander," to mean that while chanting the holy names of Kåñëa one may go anywhere or engage in any activity without discrimination. Therefore it is stated, vicared asaìgaù: one may wander freely, but at the same time one must strictly avoid the association of those who are not interested in Kåñëa consciousness or who are engaged in sinful life. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu has stated, asat-saìga-tyäga-ei vaiñëava äcära (Cc. Madhya 22.87): a Vaiñëava is known by his complete avoidance of all mundane association. If in the course of traveling and chanting the glories of the Lord a Vaiñëava preacher finds a submissive nondevotee who is willing to hear about Kåñëa, the preacher will always give his merciful association to such a person. But a Vaiñëava should strictly avoid those who are not interested in hearing about Kåñëa.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, those who do not engage in hearing the astonishing pastimes and holy names of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and who do not relish the Lord's pastimes are simply executing mundane, illusory activities or indulging in false, materialistic renunciation. Frustrated living entities sometimes take to dry impersonalism and avoid the descriptions of the Supreme Lord's eternal name, form, qualities, entourage and pastimes. But if one gains the association of a pure devotee, one gives up the path of dry speculative argument and becomes situated on the actual Vedic path of devotional service to the Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura says that the word dvaita, or "duality," expresses the false understanding that some object has a substantial existence independent of Kåñëa. The Mäyäväda conception of advaita, which lacks any spiritual distinctions, is simply another manifestation of the mind's function of acceptance and rejection. The eternal appearance and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead never contradict the concept of advaya-jïäna, or transcendental knowledge beyond duality.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> By chanting the holy name of the Supreme Lord, one comes to the stage of love of Godhead. Then the devotee is fixed in his vow as an eternal servant of the Lord, and he gradually becomes very much attached to a particular name and form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As his heart melts with ecstatic love, he laughs very loudly or cries or shouts. Sometimes he sings and dances like a madman, for he is indifferent to public opinion.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In this verse, pure love of God is being described. Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has described this spiritual situation as sampräpta-prema-lakñana-bhakti-yogasya saàsära-dharmätétäà gatim, or the perfectional stage of life in which one's devotional service to the Supreme Lord is enriched by ecstatic love. At that time, one's spiritual duties are entirely beyond the scope of worldly affairs. In Çré Caitanya-caritämåta (Ädi 7.78), there is the following statement by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">dhairya dharite näri, hailäma unmatta</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">häsi, kändi, näci, gäi, yaiche mada-matta</div>
<div class="First"> "While chanting the holy name of the Lord in pure ecstasy, I lose myself, and thus I laugh, cry, dance and sing just like a madman." Caitanya Mahäprabhu immediately approached His spiritual master to ask him why He had apparently become mad by chanting the holy name of Kåñëa. His guru replied:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kåñëa-näma-mahä-mantrera ei ta ' svabhäva</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yei jape, tära kåñëe upajaye bhäva</div>
<div class="First"> "It is the nature of the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra that anyone who chants it immediately develops his loving ecstasy for Kåñëa." (Cc. Ädi 7.83) In this connection Çréla Prabhupäda has commented, "These symptoms are very prominently manifest in the body of a pure devotee. Sometimes when our students of the Kåñëa consciousness movement chant and dance, even in India people are astonished to see how these foreigners have learned to chant and dance in this ecstatic fashion. As explained by Caitanya Mahäprabhu, however, actually this is not due to practice, for without extra endeavor these symptoms become manifest in anyone who sincerely chants the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra."</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has warned us in this regard about the ungodly sahajiyäs who imitate the pastimes of the Supreme Lord in an unauthorized way, neglecting the standard injunctions of Vedic scriptures, foolishly trying to take the position of Kåñëa as Puruñottama, and thus making a cheap farce of the exalted pastimes of the Lord. Their so-called ecstatic symptoms like crying, shivering and falling on the ground are not to be confused with the advanced features of devotional service described by Çrédhara Svämé as sampräpta-prema-lakñaëa-bhakti-yoga. Çréla Prabhupäda comments in this regard, "One who has attained this bhäva stage is no longer under the clutches of the illusory energy." Similarly, Kåñëadäsa Kaviräja states:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">païcama puruñärtha-premänandämåta-sindhu</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mokñädi änanda yära nahe eka bindu</div>
<div class="First"> "For a devotee who has actually developed bhäva [love of Godhead], the pleasure derived from dharma, artha, käma and mokña appears like a drop in the presence of the sea." (Cc. Ädi 7.85) As already stated in the previous verse of this chapter, gäyan vilajjo vicared asaìgaù: one exhibits the ecstatic symptoms of love of Godhead when he is asaìga, free from all attachment to material sense gratification.</div>
<div class="First"> The word loka-bähyaù in this verse indicates that a pure devotee on the platform of prema, love of Godhead, is not at all concerned with ridicule, praise, respect or criticism from ordinary people in the bodily concept of life. Kåñëa is the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and when He reveals Himself to a surrendered servant, all doubt and speculation about the nature of the Absolute are vanquished forever.</div>
<div class="First"> In this connection Çrépäda Madhväcärya has quoted a verse from the Varäha Puräëa:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kecid unmäda-vad bhaktä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bähya-liìga-pradarçakäù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kecid äntara-bhaktäù syuù</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">mukha-prasädäd däròhyäc ca</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhaktir jïeyä na cänyataù</div>
<div class="First"> "Some devotees of the Lord exhibit external symptoms, acting like madmen, others are introspective devotees, and still others partake of both natures. It is by one's steadfastness and by the merciful vibrations emanating from one's mouth that one's devotion can be judged, not otherwise." Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has given a very nice example to illustrate ecstatic laughing and other symptoms of love of Godhead: 'Oh, that thief Kåñëa, the son of Yaçodä, has entered the house to steal the fresh butter. Grab Him! Keep Him away!' Hearing these menacing words spoken by the elderly gopé Jaraté, Kåñëa immediately prepares to leave the house. The devotee to whom this transcendental pastime is revealed laughs in ecstasy. But suddenly he can no longer see Kåñëa. He then cries in great lamentation, 'Oh! I achieved the greatest fortune in the world, and now it has suddenly slipped from my hands!' Thus the devotee cries loudly, 'So my Lord! Where are You? Give me Your answer!' The Lord answers, 'My dear devotee, I heard your loud complaint, and so I have again come before you.' Upon seeing Lord Kåñëa again, the devotee begins to sing, 'Today my life has become perfect.' Thus overwhelmed with transcendental bliss, he begins to dance like a madman." Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura also notes that the word druta-cittaù or "with a melted heart," indicates that one's heart, melted by the fire of anxiety to see the Lord, becomes like Jambünadé, a river of roseapple juice. The äcärya further points out, näma-kértanasya sarvotkarñam: the present and previous verse clearly distinguish the exalted position of çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù [SB 7.5.23], chanting and hearing the name and glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Caitanya Mahäprabhu also emphasized this by quoting:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">harer näma harer näma</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">harer nämaiva kevalam</div>

In his purports to Caitanya-caritämåta (Ädi 7.76), Çréla Prabhupäda has given an elaborate explanation of this verse. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura recommends that we study the following verse in this connection:</div>

<div class="Translation"> A devotee should not see anything as being separate from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Ether, fire, air, water, earth, the sun and other luminaries, all living beings, the directions, trees and other plants, the rivers and oceans—whatever a devotee experiences he should consider to be an expansion of Kåñëa. Thus seeing everything that exists within creation as the body of the Supreme Lord, Hari, the devotee should offer his sincere respects to the entire expansion of the Lord's body.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has given this example from the Puräëas: yat paçyati, tat tv anurägätiçayena "jagad dhana-mayaà lubdhäù kämukäù käminé-mayam" iti-vat hareù çaréram. "Because of a greedy person's obsession with money, wherever he goes he sees an opportunity for acquiring wealth. Similarly a very lusty man notices women everywhere." In the same way, a pure devotee should see the transcendental form of the Lord within everything, since everything is an expansion of the Lord. It is our practical experience that a greedy man will see money everywhere. If he goes to the forest he will immediately consider whether it would be profitable to purchase the forest land and sell the trees to a paper mill. Similarly, if a lusty man goes to the same forest he will look everywhere for beautiful women tourists who might happen to be there. And if a devotee goes to the same forest he will see Kåñëa there, knowing correctly that the entire forest, as well as the sky canopy above, is the inferior energy of the Lord. Kåñëa is supremely sacred, being the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and since everything that exists expands directly or indirectly from the body of the Lord, everything is sacred when seen through the eyes of a self-realized person. Therefore as stated in this verse, praëamet: one should offer one's sincere respects to everything. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has mentioned that we should see the personal form of Kåñëa everywhere. This verse does not approve of the impersonal, atheistic philosophy that everything is God. In this regard, Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted from the Hari-vaàça:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sarvaà harer vaçatvena</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">çaréraà tasya bhaëyate</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ananyädhipatitväc ca</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tad ananyam udéryate</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na cäpy abhedo jagatäà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">viñëoù pürëa-guëasya tu</div>
<div class="First"> "Because everything is under the control of the Supreme Lord, Hari, everything is considered to be His body. He is the original source and master of everything, and therefore nothing should be seen as different from Him. Nonetheless, one should not foolishly conclude that there is absolutely no difference between the material universe and Lord Viñëu, who is full of His own unique spiritual qualities."</div>
<div class="First"> The example is often given of the sun and the sun's rays. The sunshine is nothing but an expansion of the sun globe, and therefore there is no qualitative difference between the sun and its rays. But although the sunshine is situated everywhere and although everything is a transformation of the sun's energy, the sun globe itself, the source of the sunshine, is not everywhere, but is situated in a particular place in the vast sky and has its own specific form. If we penetrate further into the sun globe we shall find the sun-god, Vivasvän. Although pseudointellectuals of the modern age who are incapable of even counting the hairs on their own heads will consider the sun-god a mythological figure, it is actually the foolish mythology of modern men to think that such a sophisticated apparatus as the sun, which provides heat and light for the entire universe, can function without intelligent administration. Transformations of solar energy make life possible on earth, and thus the earth can be understood to consist of an endless variety of secondary manifestations of all-pervading solar energy.</div>
<div class="First"> So within the sun planet is the personality Vivasvän, the chief administrator of the solar functions; the sun globe itself is localized; and the sun's rays expand everywhere. Similarly Çré Kåñëa, Çyämasundara, is the original Personality of Godhead (bhagavän svayam); He expands Himself as the localized Supersoul (Paramätmä) in everyone's heart; and finally He expands His potency by His personal bodily glow, the all-pervading spiritual effulgence called the brahmajyoti. The entire material manifestation floats within the rays of this brahmajyoti. Just as all life on earth is a transformation of the all-pervading rays of the sun, the entire cosmic manifestation is a transformation of the spiritual rays of the brahmajyoti. As stated in the Brahma-saàhitä (5.40):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yasya prabhä prabhavato jagad-aëòa-koöikoöiñv</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">açeña-vasudhädi vibhüti-bhinnam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tad brahma niñkalam anantam açeña-bhütaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi</div>
<div class="First"> "I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is endowed with great power. The glowing effulgence of His transcendental form is the impersonal Brahman, which is absolute, complete and unlimited and which displays the varieties of countless planets, with their different opulences, in millions and millions of universes." Therefore, the brahmajyoti is the spiritual light that emanates directly from the body of the Lord. This universe is a transformation of that spiritual energy, and therefore everything that exists is in one sense connected directly with the personal body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is emphasized here that we should offer respect to everything that exists, recognizing it to be the energy of the Lord. The example may be given that if a man is important his property is also important. The president of a country is the most important person in the country, and therefore everyone must respect his property. Similarly, everything that exists is an expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and should be respected accordingly. If we fail to see everything that exists as the energy of the Lord, we risk the danger of drifting into the Mäyäväda philosophy, which according to Caitanya Mahäprabhu is the most deadly poison for one trying to advance in actual spiritual life. Mäyävädi-bhäñya çunile haya sarva-näça (Cc. Madhya 6.169). If we try to understand Kåñëa alone, without the expansion of His potency, we shall not understand such statements in Bhagavad-gétä as väsudevaù sarvam and ahaà sarvasya prabhavaù [Bg. 10.8].</div>
<div class="First"> As already explained in this chapter, bhayaà dvitiyäbhiniveçataù syät: fear or illusion arises from thinking that there is something not dependent upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Now, in this verse, the specific process for overcoming this fearful illusion is given. One must train one's mind to see everything that exists as an expansion of the potency of the Supreme Lord. By offering respects to everything and meditating upon everything as part of the body of the Lord, one will become free from fear. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (5.29), suhådaà sarva-bhütänäm: Kåñëa is the well-wishing friend of every living being. As soon as one understands that everything that exists is under the powerful control of one's most beloved friend, one comes to the stage in which the whole universe becomes a blissful abode (viçvaà pürëa-sukhäyate), because he sees Kåñëa everywhere.</div>
<div class="First"> If Kåñëa's personality were not the source of everything and if everything were not connected to Kåñëa, one might be proper in concluding that Kåñëa's personality is a material manifestation of some impersonal truth. As stated in Vedänta-sütra, janmädy asya yataù: [SB 1.1.1] the Absolute Truth is that from which everything emanates. Similarly, Kåñëa says, ahaà sarvasya prabhavaù: [Bg. 10.8] "I am the source of everything." If we see anything totally disconnected from the personal body of Kåñëa, we may doubt whether Kåñëa's personality is actually the absolute source described in Vedänta-sütra. As soon as one feels this way, he becomes fearful and should be understood to be under the control of the Lord's illusory energy.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has warned us that if we do not see everything as a manifestation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we shall become victims of phalgu-vairägya, or immature renunciation. Whatever we see as disconnected from Kåñëa will have in our mind no relationship to Kåñëa's service. But if we see everything as connected to Kåñëa, we shall use everything for Kåñëa's satisfaction. This is called yukta-vairägya. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, "One who has experienced his own true identity understands that all things exist as paraphernalia for giving ecstatic pleasure to the Supreme Lord. Thus one becomes free from the separatist vision in which one sees the world as existing for one's own enjoyment. In the transcendental state, whatever a devotee sees reminds him of Kåñëa, and thus his transcendental knowledge and bliss increase." Because the impersonalist philosophers fail to see everything as belonging to the personal form of Kåñëa, they reject this world as having no true existence (jagan mithyä). But since the material world is an emanation from the supreme reality, Kåñëa, it does in fact exist. Its nonexistence is simply a creation of the imagination, and one cannot possibly act on such an imaginary platform. Therefore, having proposed an illusory theory and being unable actually to live on such a platform, the impersonalist comes back to the material platform for altruistic or gross sense gratificatory activities. Since the impersonalist does not accept the personal proprietorship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he does not know how or for whom to engage the things of this world, and since it is impossible to reject this world totally while living within it, he runs the risk of again becoming entangled in material fruitive activities. Therefore as stated in Bhagavad-gétä (12.5), kleço 'dhikataras teñäm: the impersonal path of imaginary philosophy is very painful to follow.</div>
<div class="First"> The conclusion is that this verse is spoken to help the devotee of the Supreme Lord advance in Kåñëa consciousness. It can be understood from the previous verses of this chapter that the ultimate goal is pure devotional service to Lord Kåñëa. If one falsely interprets this verse to sanction the imaginary Mäyäväda philosophy that everything is God, one will simply become bewildered and fall from the path of spiritual advancement.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Devotion, direct experience of the Supreme Lord, and detachment from other things—these three occur simultaneously for one who has taken shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in the same way that pleasure, nourishment and relief from hunger come simultaneously and increasingly, with each bite, for a person engaged in eating.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has explained this analogy as follows: Bhakti, or devotion, may be compared to tuñöi (satisfaction) because they both take the form of pleasure. Pareçänubhava (experience of the Supreme Lord) and puñöi (nourishment) are analogous because both sustain one's life. Finally, virakti (detachment) and kñud-apäya (cessation of hunger) may be compared because both free one from further hankering so that one may experience çänti, or peace.</div>
<div class="First"> A person who is eating not only becomes uninterested in other activities but increasingly becomes uninterested in the food itself, according to his satisfaction. On the other hand, according to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, although one who is experiencing the blissful Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, becomes uninterested in anything other than Kåñëa, his attachment to Kåñëa increases at every moment. Therefore it is to be understood that the transcendental beauty and qualities of the Supreme Lord are not material, since one never becomes satiated by relishing the bliss of the Supreme Lord. The word viraktiù is very significant in this verse. Virakti means "detachment," whereas tyäga means "renunciation." According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, the word renunciation can be used in a situation in which one considers giving up an enjoyable object. But by considering everything to be potential paraphernalia in the service of Lord Kåñëa, as described in the previous verse, one need not give thought to renunciation, for one uses everything in the proper way in the service of the Lord. Yukta-vairägyam ucyate.</div>
<div class="First"> The very pleasant analogy of a good meal is given in this verse. A hungry man busily consuming a sumptuous plate of food is not interested in anything else happening around him. In fact, he considers any other topic or activity a disturbance to his concentration on the delicious meal. Similarly, as one advances in Kåñëa consciousness one considers anything unrelated to the devotional service of Kåñëa an obnoxious disturbance. Such concentrated love of Godhead has been described in the Second Canto of the Bhägavatam by the words tévreëa bhakti-yogena yajeta puruñaà param (SB 2.3.10). One should not make an artificial show of renouncing the material world; rather, one should systematically train the mind to see everything as an expansion of the opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Just as a hungry materialistic man, upon seeing sumptuous food, immediately desires to put it in his mouth, an advanced devotee of Kåñëa, upon seeing a material object, immediately becomes eager to use it for the pleasure of Kåñëa. Without the spontaneous hunger to engage everything in the service of Kåñëa and to dive deeper and deeper into the ocean of love of Kåñëa, so-called realization of God or loose talk about so-called religious life is irrelevant to the actual experience of entering the kingdom of God.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the path of bhakti-yoga is so joyful and practical that even in the stage of sädhana-bhakti, in which one follows rules and regulations without an advanced understanding, one can perceive the ultimate result.

<div class="First"> As soon as one surrenders to the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa (prapadyamänasya), giving up all other activities (viraktir anyatra ca), one is immediately to be considered a liberated soul (jévan-muktaù). The Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, is so merciful that when a living entity understands that the personality Kåñëa is the source of everything and surrenders to the Lord, Kåñëa personally takes charge of him and reveals to him within his heart that he is under the Lord's full protection. Thus devotion, direct experience of the Personality of Godhead, and detachment from other objects become manifest even in the beginning stage of bhakti-yoga, since bhakti-yoga begins at the point of liberation.

<div class="First"> "A person who has given up all desires for sense gratification, who lives free from desires, who has given up all sense of proprietorship and who is devoid of false ego—he alone can attain real peace." Çréla Prabhupäda comments, "To become desireless means not to desire anything for sense gratification. In other words, desire for becoming Kåñëa conscious is actually desirelessness." There is a similar statement in the Caitanya-caritämåta (Madhya 19.149):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kåñëa-bhakta-niñkäma, ataeva 'çänta'</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhukti-mukti-siddhi-kämé sakali 'açänta'</div>
<div class="First"> "Because a devotee of Lord Kåñëa is desireless, he is peaceful. Fruitive workers desire material enjoyment, jïänés desire liberation, and yogés desire material opulence; therefore they are all lusty and cannot be peaceful." Generally there are three classes of living entities afflicted with selfish desire. These are the bhukti-kämé, mukti-kämi and siddhi-kämi. Bhukti-kämé refers to those ordinary persons who desire money and everything money can buy. Such a primitive mentality is based on the desire to enjoy money, sex and social prestige. When a living being becomes frustrated with this hallucination, he takes to the path of speculative philosophy and analytically tries to track down the source of illusion. Such a person is called mukti-kämé because he desires to negate material illusion and merge into an impersonal spiritual state, free from anxiety. The mukti-kämé is also motivated by personal desire, although the desire is somewhat more elevated. Similarly the siddhi-kämé, or the mystic yogé who desires the spectacular powers of mystic yoga, such as reaching one's hand across the world or making oneself smaller than the smallest or lighter than the lightest, is also infected by material or selfish desire. Therefore it is said, sakali 'açänta.' If one has any personal desire, whether it be material, philosophical or mystic, he will be açänta, or ultimately frustrated, because he will see himself as the central object of satisfaction. This egocentric concept is in itself illusory and therefore ultimately frustrating. On the other hand, kåñëa-bhakta niñkäma, ataeva 'çänta': [Cc. Madhya 19.149] a devotee of Lord Kåñëa is niñkäma; he has no personal desire. His only desire is to please Kåñëa. Lord Çiva himself has praised this outstanding quality</div>

Elevation to the heavenly kingdom, condemnation to hell and liberation from material bondage all appear the same to a devotee." (SB 6.17.28) Although the impersonalist philosopher proposes that everything is one, the devotee of the Lord is actually tulyärtha-darçé, or empowered with the vision of oneness. The devotee sees everything as the potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and therefore desires to engage everything in the service of the Lord, for the Lord's satisfaction. Since the devotee does not see anything as dvitéya, or outside the scope of the Lord's potency, he is happy in any situation. Having no personal desire, the devotee of Kåñëa is actually çänta, or peaceful, because he has achieved the perfection of life, love of Kåñëa. He is actually situated in his eternal constitutional position under the direct shelter and protection of the omnipotent Parameçvara, Kåñëa.

But for practical advancement in Kåñëa consciousness one should associate at least with a second-class devotee. And if one can receive the mercy of a first-class devotee of the Lord, one's perfection is very easily guaranteed. Thus Nimi Mahäräja is humbly inquiring, "What are the character, behavior and speech of devotees?" The King wants to know the particular symptoms of body, mind and speech by which the different categories uttama-adhikäré, madhyama-adhikäré and kaniñöha-adhikäré are clearly identified. In response to the King's inquiry, another of the nava-yogendras, namely Havir, will give a further elaboration of the science of Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"></div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">In Bhagavad-gétä (6.30) the Lord says,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yo mäà paçyati sarvatra</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sarvaà ca mayi paçyati</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tasyähaà na praëaçyämi</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sa ca me na praëaçyati</div>
<div class="First"> "For one who sees Me everywhere and sees everything in Me, I am never lost, nor is he ever lost to Me." Çréla Prabhupäda comments, "A person in Kåñëa consciousness certainly sees Lord Kåñëa everywhere, and he sees everything in Kåñëa. Such a person may appear to see all separate manifestations of the material nature, but in each and every instance he is conscious of Kåñëa, knowing that everything is the manifestation of Kåñëa's energy. Nothing can exist without Kåñëa, and Kåñëa is the Lord of everything-this is the basic principle of Kåñëa consciousness."</div>
<div class="First"> The qualification for seeing Kåñëa everywhere is stated in the Brahma-saàhitä (5.38):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">premäïjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">santaù sadaiva hådayeñu vilokayanti</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yaà syämasundaram acintya-guëa-svarüpaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi</div>
<div class="First"> "I worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, who is always seen by the devotee whose eyes are anointed with the pulp of love. He is seen in His eternal form of Çyämasundara, situated within the heart of the devotee." A devotee of the highest level of spiritual qualification is glorified for the expansiveness of his spiritual vision. For example, when the stalwart demon Hiraëyakaçipu questioned his self-realized son Prahläda Mahäräja as to the whereabouts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Prahläda, being a mahä-bhägavata, or pure devotee, answered straightforwardly that the Supreme Lord is everywhere. The demoniac father then asked if God was in the pillar of the palace. When Prahläda answered yes, Hiraëyakaçipu, being a bona fide demon, struck the pillar with his sword, trying to kill God, or at least disprove His existence. Then Lord Nåsiàhadeva, the most ferocious form of the Supreme Lord, immediately appeared and finished forever the illicit program of Hiraëyakaçipu. Thus Prahläda Mahäräja can be accepted as an uttama-adhikäré devotee.</div>
<div class="First"> A pure devotee is completely free from the tendency to enjoy things separately from the Lord's service. He does not see anything in the universe as unfavorable, because he sees everything as the expanded potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a devotee's purpose in existing is to give pleasure somehow or other to the Supreme Lord. Thus everything that a pure devotee experiences, moment by moment, increases his ecstatic loving desire to satisfy the transcendental senses of the Lord. The three modes of material nature torment the conditioned soul, who absorbs his mind in the separated, material energy of the Lord. The function of this separated energy, bhinnä prakåti, is to take the living entity away from the reality, which is that everything is within Kåñëa and Kåñëa is within everything. Being covered by gross ignorance, the bewildered conditioned soul believes that only the objects of his own limited vision actually exist. Sometimes such foolish persons speculate that if a tree falls in a forest with no one to hear it, there will actually be no sound. The conditioned souls do not consider that since the Supreme Personality of Godhead is all-pervading, there is no question of no one's hearing; the Lord always hears. As stated in the Thirteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä (13.14), sarvataù çrutimal loke: the Supreme Lord hears everything. He is upadrañöa, the witness of everything (Bg. 13.23).</div>
<div class="First"> In this verse the word bhägavatottamaù, "the most advanced devotee," indicates that there are those who are not gross materialists but who are not the highest devotees. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, those who cannot properly distinguish between devotees and nondevotees and who therefore never worship the pure devotees of the Lord are to be known as kaniñöha-adhikäris, devotees on the lowest stage of devotional service. Such kaniñöha-adhikäris engage in worship of the Supreme Lord, especially in the temple, but are indifferent to the Lord's devotees. Thus they misunderstand this statement by Lord Çiva in the Padma Puräëa:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ärädhanänäà sarveñäà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">viñëor ärädhanaà param</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tasmäd parataraà devi</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tadéyänäà samarcanam</div>
<div class="First"> "O Devé, the most exalted system of worship is the worship of Lord Viñëu. Greater than that is the worship of tadéya, or anything belonging to Viñëu." Çréla Prabhupäda comments on this verse, "Çré Viñëu is sac-cid-änanda-vigraha [Bs. 5.1]. Similarly the most confidential servant of Kåñëa, the spiritual master, and all devotees of Viñëu are tadéya. The sac-cid-änanda-vigraha, guru, Vaiñëavas and things used by them must be considered tadéya, and without a doubt worshipable by all living beings." (Cc. Madhya 12.38 purport) Typically the kaniñöha-adhikäré is eager to engage his materialistic qualifications in the service of the Lord, mistaking such material expertise to be the sign of advanced devotion. But by continuing to serve the Supreme Lord and the devotees engaged in propagating the Lord's mission, the kaniñöha-adhikäré also advances in his realization and comes to the stage of dedicating his activities to helping more advanced Vaiñëavas. Even such kaniñöha-adhikärés can help ordinary living entities by their association, since at least the kaniñöha-adhikärés have faith that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because of this faith, the kaniñöha-adhikäré gradually becomes inimical to those who are opposed to the Lord. As he gradually becomes more and more inimical to those who hate the supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and becomes more attracted to friendship with other faithful servants of the Lord, the kaniñöha-adhikäré approaches the second-class stage, called madhyama. In the madhyama stage the Vaiñëava sees the Lord as the cause of all causes and the chief goal of everyone's loving propensity. He sees the Vaiñëavas as his only friends within this morbid world and is eager to bring innocent people within the shelter of Vaiñëava society. Also, a madhyama-adhikäré strictly avoids associating with the self-proclaimed enemies of God. When such an intermediate qualification becomes mature, the concept of supreme qualification begins to present itself; that is, one comes to the stage of uttama-adhikäré.</div>
<div class="First"> A kaniñöha-adhikäré guru, one who is simply attached to performing religious ceremonies and worshiping the Deity, without appreciation for other Vaiñëavas, especially those who are preaching the message of the Lord, will especially appeal to persons interested in the dry cultivation of knowledge. As a living entity develops mundane piety, he proudly devotes himself to regulated work and nobly tries to detach himself from the fruits of his work. Through such regulated detached work, knowledge or wisdom gradually arises. As knowledge or wisdom becomes prominent, the pious materialist becomes attracted to altruistic and charitable work and gives up gross sinful activities. If he is fortunate, he then becomes favorable to the transcendental devotional service of the Lord. Desiring a mere intellectual understanding of devotional service, such a pious materialist may seek shelter at the feet of a kaniñöha-adhikäré. If able to advance to the madhyama qualification, he then becomes attracted to a Vaiñëava actively engaged in preaching Kåñëa consciousness. And when fully mature on the platform of intermediate devotion, he becomes attracted to the mahä-bhägavata level and is awarded a glimpse of the exalted position of the mahä-bhägavata spiritual master by the grace of Kåñëa within his heart. If one gradually goes on in the devotional service of the Lord, one becomes established as a paramahaàsa mahä-bhägavata. At this stage all of his actions. movements and engagements in preaching are dedicated solely to the satisfaction of Kåñëa. The illusory potency, mäyä, has no power to throw or cover such a purified living entity. In Upadeçämåta (5) Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé has described this stage of life as bhajana-vijïam ananyam anya-nindädi-çünya-hådam.</div>
<div class="First"> A mahä-bhägavata, being empowered by the Supreme Lord, Yogeçvara, is endowed with the supernatural power to inspire and give success to the madhyama-adhikäré who follows in his footsteps and to elevate a kaniñöha-adhikäré gradually to the intermediate platform. Such devotional power springs automatically from the ocean of mercy found within the heart of a pure devotee. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura points out that a mahä-bhägavata has no desire to inflict punishment on the enemies of the Lord. Rather, he engages the madhyama-adhikärés and kaniñöha-adhikärés in preaching work to purify the polluted mentality of the inimical souls, who are falsely imagining the material world to be separate from Kåñëa. There are unfortunate living entities who are unable to understand the glory of a kaniñöha-adhikäré within the realm of devotional service, have no praise for the more advanced state of intermediate devotion and cannot even begin to understand the most exalted stage, that of the uttama-adhikäré. Such unfortunate souls, attracted to impersonal Mäyäväda speculation, follow faithfully in the footsteps of Kaàsa, Agha, Baka and Pütanä and are thus killed by Çré Hari. In this way the community of sense gratifiers remains uninterested in service at the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, and according to the individual perverted vision of so-called self-interest, each materialist chooses his own misfortune in the form of repeated birth and death in various types of material bodies. There are 8,400,000 species of material forms, and the materialistic living entities select the particular flavors of birth, old age, disease and death they wish to inflict upon themselves under the hallucinations of so-called material progress.</div>
<div class="First"> The analogy is given that a lusty man, being agitated by sexual desire, sees the whole world as filled with sensuous women. In a similar way, a pure devotee of Kåñëa sees Kåñëa consciousness everywhere, although it may be temporarily covered. Thus one sees the world just as one sees himself (ätmavan manyate jagat). On this basis one may argue that the vision of the mahä-bhagavata is also illusioned, since the Bhägavatam has already stated throughout that those conditioned by the three modes of material nature are not at all Kåñëa conscious but in fact are inimical to Kåñëa. But although the conditioned living entity may appear inimical to the Lord, the eternal, unalterable fact is that every living being is part and parcel of Kåñëa. Although one's ecstatic love for Kåñëa may now be covered by the influence of mäyä, by the causeless mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead the conditioned soul will gradually be promoted to the stage of Kåñëa consciousness. In fact, everyone is suffering the pangs of separation from Kåñëa. Because the conditioned soul imagines that he has no eternal relationship with Kåñëa, he is unable to ascertain that all his miseries are due to this separation. This is mäyä, or "that which is not." Actually, to think that misery arises from anything other than separation from Kåñëa is to be in illusion. So when a pure devotee sees living entities suffering within this world, he correctly feels that just as he is suffering because of separation from Kåñëa, all other living beings are also suffering from separation from Kåñëa. The difference is that a pure devotee correctly ascertains the cause of his heartbreak whereas the conditioned soul, bewildered by mäyä, is unable to understand his eternal relationship with Kåñëa and the unlimited pain arising from neglect of that relationship.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has quoted the following verses, which illustrate the ecstatic feelings of the topmost devotees of the Lord. In the Tenth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (10.35.9) the goddesses of Vraja speak as follows:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">vana-latäs tarava ätmani viñëuà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">vyaïjayantya iva puñpa-phaläòhyäù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">praëata-bhära-viöapä madhu-dhäräù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">prema-håñöa-tanavo vavåñuù sma</div>
<div class="First"> "The creepers and trees of the forest, their branches weighed down by rich coverings of flowers and fruits, seemed to manifest Lord Viñëu within their hearts. Exhibiting eruptions of ecstatic love upon their bodies, they poured down rains of honey." Elsewhere in the Tenth Canto (SB 10.21.15) it is said:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nadyas tadä tad upadhärya mukunda-gétam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ävarta-lakñita-mano-bhava-bhagna-vegäù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">äliìgana-sthagitam ürmi-bhujair murärer</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">gåhëanti päda-yugalaà kamalopahäräù</div>
<div class="First"> "Hearing the song of Lord Mukunda's flute, the rivers then stopped their currents, although the minds of the rivers could still be ascertained from the presence of whirlpools. With the arms of their waves the rivers seized the two lotus feet of Muräri, taking help from the lotus plants, and thus He became trapped in their embrace." And in the last chapter of the Tenth Canto (10.90.15), the queens of Dvärakä pray:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kurari vilapasi tvaà véta-nidrä na çeñe</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">svapiti jagati rätryäm éçvaro gupta-bodhaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">vayam iva sakhi kaccid gäòha-nirviddha-cetä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nalina-nayana-häsodära-lélekñitena</div>
<div class="First"> "Dear kuraré, now it is very late at night. Everyone is sleeping. The whole world is now calm and peaceful. At this time, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is sleeping, although His knowledge is undisturbed by any circumstance. Then why are you not sleeping? Why are you lamenting like this throughout the whole night? Dear friend, is it that you are also attracted by the lotus eyes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and by His sweet smiling and attractive words, exactly as we are? Do those dealings of the Supreme Personality of Godhead pinch your heart as they do ours?" Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has also given mother Yaçodä as an example of an uttama-adhikäré, for mother Yaçodä actually saw all living beings within the mouth of Kåñëa during the Lord's Våndävana lélä.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura also points out in his commentary, atra paçyed iti tathä darçana-yogyataiva vivakñitä, na tu tathä darçanasya särva-kälikatä. "In this verse the word paçyet, or 'one must see,' does not mean that at every moment one is visualizing the form of Kåñëa; rather, it means that one has reached the exalted platform of devotional service on which he is fit to see or is capable of seeing Kåñëa's form." If only those who constantly see the form of Kåñëa are to be considered uttama-adhikärés, then Närada, Vyäsa and Çukadeva cannot be considered topmost devotees, since they do not always see the Lord everywhere. Of course, Närada, Vyäsa and Çukadeva are considered to be on the highest standard of pure devotional service, and therefore the real qualification is tad-didåkñädhikya, or having an overwhelming desire to see the Lord. Therefore the statement of Bhagavad-gétä that a devotee should see Kåñëa everywhere (yo mäà paçyati sarvatra) can be understood in terms of the example of a lusty man's thinking that the world is full of beautiful women. Similarly, one should become transcendentally so desirous of seeing the Lord that one can perceive within the entire universe nothing but Kåñëa and His potency. Väsudevaù sarvam iti [Bg. 7.19]. In Çréla Prabhupäda's correspondence in 1969 with Professor J. F. Staal of the University of California, Çréla Prabhupäda claimed that all of his disciples who were strictly following the intense program of Kåñëa consciousness were in fact sudurlabha-mahätmäs who were seeing väsudevaù sarvam. In other words, if one is constantly engaged in Kåñëa consciousness with an intense desire to please the Lord and one day gain His association, it is to be understood that in one's life there is nothing but Kåñëa. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has warned us, however, that a mere theoretical or academic understanding that Kåñëa is everything does not qualify one as a first-class devotee. One must actually have developed love for Kåñëa. Therefore it can be practically understood that anyone who enthusiastically adopts the Kåñëa consciousness program and eagerly participates in the preaching activities of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness is acting on the platform of a madhyama-adhikäré devotee. When such a devotee becomes overwhelmed by his desire to serve Kåñëa and associate with the Lord, so much so that he is not attracted to anything else within the universe, he should be understood to be an uttama-adhikäré Vaiñëava, as mentioned in this verse.</div>

<div class="Translation"> An intermediate or second-class devotee, called madhyama-adhikäré, offers his love to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is a sincere friend to all the devotees of the Lord, shows mercy to ignorant people who are innocent and disregards those who are envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Bhagavad-gétä, every living entity within the material world is eternally a minute fragmental portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Mamaiväàço jéva-loke jéva-bhütaù sanätanaù (Bg. 15.7). But because of the influence of mäyä the puffed-up conditioned souls become inimical to the service of the Lord and the Lord's devotees, choose leaders among the materialistic sense gratifiers, and thus engage busily in a useless society of the cheaters and the cheated, a society of the blind leading the blind into a ditch. Although the community of Vaiñëavas is sincerely eager to serve the conditioned souls by bringing them back to their constitutional position, by mäyä's influence the materialistic living entity becomes hardhearted and rejects the mercy of the Lord's devotees.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, although a second-class devotee is eager to preach to the innocent conditioned souls, he should avoid the atheistic class of men so that he will not become disturbed or polluted by their association. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has confirmed that a Vaiñëava should be indifferent to those who are envious of the Supreme Lord. It is practically seen that when such persons are informed of the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they attempt to ridicule the Supreme Lord, thus further deteriorating their polluted existence. In this connection Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has quoted from the Tenth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (10.20.36):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">girayo mumucus toyaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kvacin na mumucuù çivam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yathä jïänämåtaà käle</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">jïänino dadate na vä</div>
<div class="First"> "Sometimes in autumn the water falls down from the tops of the hills to supply clean water, and sometimes the water stops. Similarly, sometimes great saintly persons distribute clear knowledge, and sometimes they are silent." In this regard, Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has mentioned that although the first-class devotee of the Lord may at times exhibit apparent hatred toward the demons because of entering the mood of the Lord's pastimes, the intermediate devotees should avoid such feelings. Furthermore, the intermediate devotee should not in any way associate with the powerful atheistic class of men, because there is danger that his mind will become bewildered by such association. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, if a Vaiñëava preacher encounters one who is envious of him, the preacher should remain far away from such an envious person. But the Vaiñëava preacher may meditate upon ways to save the envious class of men. Such meditation is called sad-äcära, or saintly behavior. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has mentioned Prahläda Mahäräja as an example of a saintly person. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam (7.9.43) there is the following statement by Prahläda:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">naivodvije para duratyaya-vaitaraëyäs</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tvad-vérya-gäyana-mahämåta-magna-cittaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">çoce tato vimukha-cetasa indriyärthamäyä-</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sukhäya bharam udvahato vimüòhän</div>
<div class="First"> "O best of the great personalities, I am not at all afraid of material existence, for wherever I stay I am fully absorbed in thought of Your glories and activities. My concern is only for the fools and rascals who are making elaborate plans for material happiness and maintaining their families, societies and countries. I am simply concerned with love for them." Although a Vaiñëava preacher constantly meditates on the welfare of all living entities, he will not associate with those who are unreceptive to the message of the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa. In this regard Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura states that even Bharata Mahäräja, Vyäsadeva and Çukadeva Gosvämé do not exhibit their mercy indiscriminately.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has given an elaborate explanation to prove that the discrimination employed by a madhyama-adhikäré preacher does not at all show a lack of mercy. He states that upekñä, or neglect, as mentioned in this verse, is the proper medicine for those who are inimical to the Supreme Lord and His devotees. Indifference from the preacher checks feelings of hostility on both sides. Although there is a Vedic injunction that one should cut out the tongue of a person who offends the Supreme Lord and His devotees, in this age it is best simply to avoid potential offenders and thus prevent them from committing further sinful activities against the Vaiñëavas. It is the duty of a Vaiñëava preacher to point out the futility of any process besides surrendering to the Supreme Lord. An envious person, however, will resent such strong preaching by a Vaiñëava and disrespect him, considering the devotee to be unnecessarily criticizing others. Such a person, who cannot appreciate the mercy of Vaiñëavas, should be neglected. Otherwise, according to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, his cheating mentality will increase day by day.</div>
<div class="First"> Those who are not attracted to the saìkértana movement of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu and who disrespect the faithful servants of Lord Caitanya, considering their strong statements about the saìkértana movement to be obstacles to their own worship of the Lord, will never be able to fix their minds on Kåñëa, but will gradually fall down from the path of devotion by confusing the external activities of the material world with the actual worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Such bewilderment has been expressed by the words bhayaà dvitéyäbhiniveçataù syät. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has strongly rejected those foolish persons who, under a plea of mercy and equal vision, perceive that a faithless person is also a devotee of the Supreme Lord and who thus try to thrust the hari-näma, or holy name of God, upon such offensive people. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta has stated, "When childish people think themselves mahä-bhägavatas and act in defiance of the Vaiñëava spiritual master, such behavior simply holds them back from receiving the mercy of the Vaiñëava guru. Bewildered by false ego, these self-proclaimed devotees gradually become fit to be ignored by pure devotees on the intermediate platform and are cheated of the mercy that comes from the devotees' satisfaction. Thus they become asädhu by constantly committing offenses against the devotees who preach the holy name of Kåñëa. Pure devotees, therefore, in all circumstances display indifference to those who falsely imagine themselves to be viçuddha-bhaktas, or pure devotees of the Lord. This indifference is an excellent manifestation of their mercy." In other words, those who criticize the Vaiñëava preachers on the second-class platform for discriminating between those who are fit to receive the Lord's mercy and those who are simply envious are misunderstanding the mission of the Lord. Kåñëa Himself states in Bhagavad-gétä (4.8):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">pariträëäya sädhünäà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">vinäçäya ca duñkåtäm</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">dharma-saàsthäpanärthäya</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sambhavämi yuge yuge</div>
<div class="First"> "To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I advent Myself millennium after millennium." Even such a great Vaiñëava as Çukadeva Gosvämé, one of the twelve mahäjanas in this universe, expressed his contempt for the evil Kaàsa. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has pointed out that even though the mahä-bhägavata devotee may act on the second-class platform for preaching, his rejection of the envious living entities does not obstruct his vision of the Lord as all-pervading. Rather, when a first-class devotee or even a second-class devotee rejects the atheistic class of men, he is expressing the mission of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A first-class or second-class Vaiñëava never actually becomes envious of another living entity, but out of intense love for the Supreme Lord he becomes angry when the Lord is offended. Also, understanding the Lord's mission, he discriminates according to the position of a particular living entity. To consider such a Vaiñëava preacher an ordinary, envious person, or to consider him sectarian because of his proclamation of pure devotional service as the most exalted of all methods of spiritual advancement, reflects a materialistic vision called vaiñëave jäti-buddhiù or guruñu nara-matiù. Such an offense drags the offender down to a hellish condition of life by the laws of nature.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, although a mahä-bhägavata sees every living entity as a pure spirit soul, such a mahä-bhägavata still experiences special ecstasies and other symptoms upon meeting another Vaiñëava. This is not contradictory to his vision as a topmost devotee; rather, it is a symptom of his love for Kåñëa. A pure devotee sees every living entity as part and parcel of Kåñëa and therefore expresses his love for Kåñëa through love for all the expansions and creations of Kåñëa. Still, such a mahä-bhägavata feels special ecstatic love upon seeing another living entity directly pleasing the senses of the Supreme Lord. Such feelings are manifest in the statement of Lord Çiva to the Pracetäs:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kñaëärdhenäpi tulaye</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na svargaà näpunar-bhavam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhagavat-saìgi-saìgasya</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">martyänäà kim utäçiñaù</div>
<div class="First"> "If one by chance associates with a devotee, even for a fraction of a moment, he no longer is subject to attraction by the results of karma or jïäna. What interest then can he have in the benedictions of the demigods, who are subject to the laws of birth and death?" (SB 4.24.57) Similarly, Lord Çiva also stated:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">atha bhägavatä yüyaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">priyäù stha bhagavän yathä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na mad bhägavatänäà ca</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">preyän anyo 'sti karhicit</div>
<div class="First"> "You are all devotees of the Lord, and as such I appreciate that you are as respectable as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. I know that in this way the devotees also respect me and that I am dear to them. Thus no one can be as dear to the devotees as I am." (SB 4.24.30) Similarly, in the First Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.7.11) Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé is mentioned as nityaà viñëu-jana-priyaù, especially dear to the pure devotees of the Lord. The wonderful loving dealings between Vaiñëavas on the topmost platform are demonstrated in the pastimes of Caitanya-caritämåta. In other words, although a Vaiñëava sees every living entity as part and parcel of Kåñëa, he must discriminate in his external behavior so as not to interfere with the original purpose of the Lord's creation, which is to reform the living entities so that they can gradually come back home, back to Godhead. A pure devotee does not foolishly pretend equal vision and approach envious persons; rather, he respects the mission of the Lord, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä (4.11) by the words ye yathä mäà prapadyante täàs tathaiva bhajämy aham. On the other hand, if it is the Lord's desire, a pure devotee can offer his respects to all living beings. For example, Çréla Jéva Gosvämé mentions that Uddhava and other pure devotees of the Lord were always prepared to offer respectful obeisances even to such persons as Duryodhana. Madhyama-adhikärés, however, should not imitate such uttama-adhikäré behavior. In this connection, the distinction between madhyama-adhikäré and uttama-adhikäré is stated by Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura as follows: atra sarva-bhüteñu bhagavad-darçana-yogyatä yasya kadäcid api na dåñöä. A madhyama-adhikäré cannot at any time perceive the presence of the Supreme Lord within all living beings, whereas an uttama-adhikäré, however he acts on the second-class platform to carry out the Lord's mission, is aware that every living entity is ultimately a forgetful Kåñëa conscious living entity. Therefore, although a devotee may externally engage four different types of behavior, as mentioned in this verse—namely, worship of the Lord, friendship with the devotees, preaching to the innocent and rejection of the demons—he is not necessarily on the second-class platform, since an uttama-adhikäré also may exhibit these symptoms to carry out the Lord's mission. In this regard, Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura mentions that it is the duty of the madhyama-adhikäré to extend himself as the right hand of the uttama-adhikäré, vowing to work for the benefit of others and offering to help in distributing love of Kåñëa.</div>
<div class="First"> Finally, Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has given a nice explanation of the difference between arcana and bhajana. Arcana refers to the platform of sädhana-bhakti, in which one serves the Lord to carry out the rules and regulations of the process. One who has achieved the shelter of the Lord's holy name and is totally engaged in the attempt to serve the Lord should be considered to be on the platform of bhajana, even though his external activities may sometimes be less strict than those of the neophyte engaged in arcana. This apparent lack of strictness, however, refers to laxity not in the basic principles of sane behavior and renunciation of sense gratification, but rather in the details of Vaiñëava ceremonies.</div>

<div class="Translation"> A devotee who faithfully engages in the worship of the Deity in the temple but does not behave properly toward other devotees or people in general is called a präkåta-bhakta, a materialistic devotee, and is considered to be in the lowest position.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Madhväcärya comments that one in the lowest stage of devotional service faithfully worships the Deity in the temple but is not aware that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is actually all-pervading. This same mentality can be seen in the Western countries, where people commit all types of sinful activities in their homes and in the street but then piously go to a church and pray to God for mercy. Actually, God is in our home, God is in the street, God is in our office, God is in the forest, God is everywhere, and therefore God should be worshiped everywhere by the process of devotional service at His</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">lotus feet. As stated in verse 41 of this chapter,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">khaà väyum agnià salilaà mahéà ca</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">yat kià ca bhütaà praëamed ananyaù</div>
<div class="First"> "A devotee should not see anything as being separate from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Ether, fire, air, water, earth, the sun and other luminaries, all living beings, the directions, trees and other plants, the rivers and oceans—whatever a devotee experiences he should consider to be an expansion of Kåñëa. Thus seeing everything that exists within creation as the body of the Supreme Lord, Hari, the devotee should offer his sincere respects to the entire expansion of the Lord's body." This is the vision of the mahä-bhagavata devotee of the Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Madhväcärya states that a madhyama-adhikäré, a devotee in the intermediate stage, sees the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the cause of all causes and therefore offers his love to the Lord. Such a devotee is a sincere friend of other devotees, is merciful to the ignorant and avoids the atheists. Nonetheless, tad-vaçatvaà na jänäti sarvasya jagato 'pi tu: his realization of the all-pervading feature of the Supreme Lord is imperfect. Although he does have a general sense that everyone is ultimately meant to be a devotee of the Supreme Lord and he tries to use everything in the service of Kåñëa, aware that everything belongs to the Lord, he may be bewildered by association with atheistic men.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Madhväcärya states, arcäyäm eva saàsthitam/ viñëum jïätvä tad-anyatra naiva jänäti yaù pumän. A kaniñöha-adhikäré has no idea that the Supreme Lord has the power to exist outside a church or temple. Furthermore, being puffed up by his own ceremonial worship (ätmano bhakti-darpataù), a kaniñöha-adhikäré cannot imagine that anyone is more pious or religious than he, and he is not even aware that other devotees are more advanced. Thus he cannot understand the madhyama or uttama standard of devotional service, and sometimes, because of his false pride, he criticizes the more advanced devotees of the Lord, neglects them or simply has no understanding of their exalted position as preachers or completely self-realized souls. Another symptom of the kaniñöha-adhikäré is that he is infatuated by the material qualifications of so-called great materialistic persons. Having a bodily concept of life himself, he is attracted by material opulence and thus minimizes the position of the Supreme Lord, Viñëu. Such a kaniñöha-adhikäré, therefore, is disturbed if a second-class devotee criticizes the nondevotees of the Lord. In the name of compassion or kindness, a kaniñöha-adhikäré approves of the nondevotional activities of such materialistic men. Because the kaniñöha-adhikäré is ignorant of the higher realms of devotional service and the unlimited transcendental bliss of Kåñëa consciousness, he sees devotional service merely as the religious aspect of life but thinks that life has many enjoyable and worthwhile nondevotional aspects. Therefore he becomes angry when second-class devotees, who are experiencing that Kåñëa is everything, criticize the nondevotees. Madhväcärya says that such a person, because of his rudimentary faith in Kåñëa, is considered a devotee, but he is bhaktädhama, a devotee on the lowest standard. If such materialistic devotees follow the rules and regulations of Deity worship, they will gradually be elevated to a higher standard and eventually become pure devotees of the Lord, unless they commit offenses against other devotees, in which case their advancement will be checked.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Madhväcärya states, tad-bhaktänäm upekñakäù kuryur viñëäv api dveñam. Those who neglect or show indifference to the devotees of the Lord are to be considered offenders at the lotus feet of Viñëu. Similarly, those who disrespect the demigods will become bereft of devotional service and be forced to rotate again and again within saàsära, the cycle of birth and death. Püjyä deväs tataù sadä: the demigods are always to be offered respect, since they are devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If someone is envious of the demigods, he is to be considered envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, one who offers sincere respect to the demigods is considered to be respecting the will of the Supreme Lord. A Vaiñëava does not foolishly think that there are many gods. He knows that there is one Supreme Personality of Godhead. But as stated many times in Çrémad-Bhägavatam, the Lord has a mission within this material world, which is to reform the conditioned living entities through the cruel laws of nature. In the Lord's mission within this world, the demigods are to be considered limbs of the Lord's body. It is stated in Bhagavad-gétä (7.20):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kämais tais tair håta-jïänäù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">prapadyante 'nya-devatäù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">taà taà niyamam ästhäya</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">prakåtyä niyatäù svayä</div>
<div class="First"> "Those whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures." But there are many examples of devotees who worshiped the demigods to get benedictions for serving Lord Kåñëa. The gopés worshiped the demigods to achieve Kåñëa, and similarly Rukmiëédevé, on the day of her marriage, engaged in such demigod worship, her only goal being Kåñëa. Even today the preachers of the Kåñëa consciousness movement cultivate important people with all kindness and diplomacy so that such wealthy or influential people will engage their resources in the devotional service of Kåñëa to glorify Kåñëa all over the world. Similarly, offering all respects to the demigods so that they will give facility for the devotional service of Kåñëa is not against the bhakti-märga, although nowadays such demigod worship has also deteriorated. Therefore, Caitanya Mahäprabhu has recommended hari-näma saìkértana, chanting the holy names of Kåñëa, as the only realistic process for this age. Nonetheless, a devotee of the Lord should not misinterpret Bhagavad-gétä's injunctions against demigod worship as a license to offend the demigods, who are bona fide Vaiñëavas.</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">Çréla Madhväcärya notes,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">viñëor upekñakaà sarve</div>

<div class="First"> "All the demigods are extremely inimical to one who does not respect Lord Viñëu. Such a person is pushed into the darkest regions by the Lord, as well as by the demigods." From this statement by Çréla Madhväcärya, the devotional sentiments of the demigods can be understood. It is stated that in the supreme liberation achieved by an uttama-adhikäré, the most exalted devotee of the Lord, the devotee enjoys transcendental bliss in the direct association of the Supreme Lord and the demigods.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, since a kaniñöha-adhikäré who cannot properly respect other devotees will certainly fail to offer respects to ordinary living entities who are not even devotees, a kaniñöha-adhikäré is useless for practical preaching work unless he comes to a higher platform of understanding. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé says, iyaà ca çraddhä na çästrärthävadhäraëa-jätä. Because the kaniñöha-adhikäré's faith is not actually based on the statements of Vedic literature, he cannot understand the exalted position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead within everyone's heart. Therefore he cannot actually manifest love of Godhead, nor can he understand the exalted position of the devotees of the Lord. Kåñëa is so glorious that Kåñëa's intimate associates must also be glorious. But this is unknown to a kaniñöha-adhikäré. Similarly, the essential qualification of a Vaiñëava, which is to offer all respects to others (amäninä manädena kértanéyaù sadä hariù [Cc. Ädi 17.31] is also conspicuous by its absence in a kaniñöha-adhikäré. If such a person, however, has faith in the Vedic literatures and tries to understand the statements of Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam, he will gradually be elevated to the second—and first-class stages of devotional service.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, a kaniñöha-adhikäré should very seriously engage in regulated worship of the Deity. The Deity is a particular incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Kåñëa can present Himself before the worshiper in five different manifestations, namely His original form as Kåñëa (para), His quadruple expansions (vyüha), His pastime incarnations (vaibhava), the Supersoul (antaryämé) and the Deity (arcä). Within the Deity form (arcä) is the Supersoul, who in turn is included within the Lord's pastime forms (vaibhava). The Supreme Lord's vaibhava-prakäça is an emanation from the catur-vyüha. This quadruple expansion of the Lord is situated within the supreme truth, Väsudeva, who Himself is situated within the svayaà-prakäça-tattva. This svayaà-prakäça consists of expansions of the ultimate svayaà-rüpa-tattva, the original form of Kåñëa within Goloka Våndävana in the spiritual sky. This hierarchy of the expansions of the Supreme Lord in the spiritual world is realized even within the material world in terms of one's eagerness to render service to the Lord. A beginner in the lowest stage of devotional service should try to dedicate all his activities to the satisfaction of the Lord and cultivate the worship of Kåñëa in the temple.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, all the plenary expansions of the Supreme Lord mentioned above descend into this world and enter within the Deity, who exhibits the function of the Supersoul by accompanying the daily life of the Vaiñëava. Although the vaibhava, or pastime expansions, of the Lord incarnate at specific times (rämädi-mürtiñu kalä-niyamena tiñöhan [Bs. 5.39]), the Supersoul and Deity forms are constantly available for the spiritual advancement of the devotees in this world. As one comes to the madhyama-adhikäré platform, one is able to understand the expansions of the Supreme Lord, whereas the kaniñöha-adhikäré's entire knowledge of the Lord is limited to the Deity. Nonetheless, Kåñëa is so kind that to encourage even the lowest class of Vaiñëavas He condenses all of His various forms into the Deity so that by worshiping the Deity the kaniñöha-adhikäré devotee is worshiping all the forms of the Lord. As the devotee makes advancement, he can understand these forms as they appear in their own way, both within this world and in the spiritual sky. As long as one remains on the third-class platform, one has no transcendental appreciation of the blissful reality of the Supreme Lord's paraphernalia and entourage. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu was very pleased with King Pratäparudra when the King, upon receiving an outer cloth from the Lord, immediately installed it as a Deity and began to worship it as being as good as the Lord Himself. Lord Çiva himself has stated, tasmäd parataraà devi tadéyänäà samarcanam. Worship of the paraphernalia, entourage or devotees of the Lord is even better than worship of the Lord, because the Lord is more pleased by worship of His devotees and entourage than by worship of Himself personally.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, the inability of the kaniñöha-adhikäré to appreciate the Lord's devotees, entourage and paraphernalia indicates that such a materialistic Vaiñëava is still affected by the speculative understanding of the karma-vadés and Mäyävädés, those who are dedicated to sense gratification and impersonal speculation about the Absolute. Çréla Prabhupäda often said that only the impersonalist desires to see Kåñëa alone; we desire to see Kåñëa with His cows, His friends, His parents, His gopés, His flute, jewelry, forest scenery and so on. Kåñëa is gorgeous in the setting of Våndävana. It is in the land of Våndävana that Lord Kåñëa, surrounded by so many beautiful associates, manifests His exalted indescribable beauty. Similarly, the unique mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is exhibited in the activities of His pure devotees who selflessly travel around the universe distributing the dust particles from Kåñëa's lotus feet on the heads of the conditioned souls. One who is uninterested in the Lord's paraphernalia, entourage and devotees has a stunted conception of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This must be due to contamination from the impersonal and sensuous understandings of life.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura states that after hundreds of lifetimes of faithfully worshiping the Deity of Lord Väsudeva with external paraphernalia, one realizes the true nature of His transcendental name and mantras, and the bondage of one's materialistic mentality slackens. In this way, as a kaniñöha-adhikäré gradually comes to perceive the mental activities of a devotee and tries seriously to advance to a higher stage, his materialistic conceptions will go away of their own accord. He then exhibits loving service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and makes friendship with the devotees who are the dearmost sons of the Lord, and by appreciating the universal quality of devotional service to Kåñëa he becomes very much eager to engage other innocent people in the service of the Lord. Further, as he begins to make significant advancement he becomes inimical to anything or anyone that hinders the progress of his devotional life, and thus he avoids atheistic people who cannot benefit by good instruction.</div>
<div class="First"> The International Society for Krishna Consciousness, founded by His Divine Grace Oà Viñëupäda Paramahaàsa Parivräjakäcärya 108 Çré Çrémad Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda, is so nice that anyone who helps this society immediately engages in preaching work for the Lord. Thus there is great facility for the members of this society to come quickly to the second-class stage of devotional service. If in the name of Kåñëa consciousness one gives up preaching and instead becomes interested simply in collecting funds for maintenance, he is showing a type of envy of other living entities. This is a symptom of the third-class platform. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, verses 45 through 47 constitute the answer to King Nimi's two questions "What is the nature of devotional service to the Lord?" and "What are the specific duties of the Vaiñëavas?"</div>

<div class="First"> According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, the position of the uttama-adhikäré, or first-class devotee of the Lord, is so worshipable that additional symptoms are now given in eight verses. It should be understood that unless one comes in contact with the lotus feet of a pure devotee of the Lord, the path of freedom from material illusion is very difficult to understand. In the fifth verse of Çré Upadeçämåta Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé has stated, çuçrüñayä bhajana-vijïam ananyam anya-nindädi-çünya-hådam épsita-saìga-labdhyä: "One should associate with and faithfully serve that pure devotee who is advanced in undeviated devotional service and whose heart is completely devoid of the propensity to criticize others." Çréla Prabhupäda comments, "In this verse Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé advises the devotee to be intelligent enough to distinguish between the kaniñöha-adhikäré, madhyama-adhikäré and uttama-adhikäré. A neophyte Vaiñëava or a Vaiñëava situated on the intermediate platform can also accept disciples, but such disciples must be on the same platform, and it should be understood that they cannot advance very well toward the ultimate goal of life under his insufficient guidance. Therefore a disciple should be careful to accept an uttama-adhikäré as a spiritual master." Therefore additional symptoms will now be given so that the conditioned soul who desires to go back home, back to Godhead, can properly identify the bona fide spiritual master.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé and Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, associating with a pure devotee of the Lord is so important that now that the various categories of devotional service have been defined, eight additional verses are given concerning the qualifications of a pure devotee, so that students of Çrémad-Bhägavatam will make no mistake in this connection. Similarly, in the Second Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä Arjuna asked Kåñëa about the symptoms of a completely Kåñëa conscious person, and Kåñëa elaborately explained the symptoms of one who is prajïä pratiñöhitä, or established in Kåñëa consciousness.</div>
<div class="First"> The particular qualification mentioned in this verse is viñëor mäyäm idaà paçyan: one should see the entire material universe as a product of the illusory energy of the Lord. There is no question of lamenting or rejoicing for that which is the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Within this world one generally laments upon losing something desirable and rejoices upon acquiring the object of his wish. But since a pure devotee has no personal desire whatsoever (kåñëa-bhakta niñkäma-ataeva 'çänta' [Cc. Madhya 19.149]), there is no question of gain or loss. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä (18.54):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">brahma-bhütaù prasannätmä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na çocati na käìkñati</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">samaù sarveñu bhüteñu</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mad-bhaktià labhate paräm</div>
<div class="First"> "One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me." Similarly, Lord Çiva says to his wife, Pärvaté, while glorifying</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">the character of King Citraketu,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">näräyaëa-paräù sarve</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na kutaçcana bibhyati</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">svargäpavarga-narakeñv</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">api tulyärtha-darçinaù</div>
<div class="First"> "Devotees solely engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Näräyaëa, never fear any condition of life. For them the heavenly planets, liberation and the hellish planets are all the same, for such devotees are interested only in the service of the Lord." (SB 6.17.28) This state of complete satisfaction in the devotional service of Kåñëa is not a mental concoction achieved by artificial meditation, but is a result of having experienced the superior nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is a reservoir of transcendental bliss. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (2.59), rasa-varjaà raso 'py asya paraà dåñövä nivartate. When impersonalists and voidists artificially try to push material things out of their minds, they undergo great hardships and ordeals in their artificial meditation.</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">(Bg. 12.5)</div>
<div class="First"> According to Lord Kåñëa, it is only with great inconvenience and suffering that one can achieve impersonal liberation, because every living being is eternally a person, being part and parcel of the Supreme Person, Kåñëa. The concept of giving up one's personal identity is a reaction to the terrible frustration of material egotism. It is not a positive program. If one is suffering unbearable pain in his hand, he may agree to have the hand amputated, but the real solution is to remove the infection so that the healthy hand may become a source of pleasure. Similarly ego, or the sense that "I am," is a source of unlimited happiness when we understand what we are, namely servants of Kåñëa. Impersonal meditation is dry and troublesome. A pure devotee realizes that he is an eternal person, part and parcel of the Supreme Person, Lord Kåñëa, and that he has the privilege as the son of God to participate in the ecstatic eternal pastimes of the Supreme Lord, loving Kåñëa and playing with Him forever. For such a devotee the pale material nature, which is but a perverted reflection of the spiritual world, becomes totally unattractive. Therefore, one who is completely attached to Kåñëa and uninterested in the manifestations of mäyä can be considered bhägavatottamaù, a pure devotee of the Lord, as described in a previous verse (bhaktiù pareçänubhavo viraktir anyatra ca [SB 11.2.42]).</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Madhväcärya has stated, viñëor mäyäà viñëv-icchädhénäm: "The words viñëor mäyäm in this verse indicate that the illusory energy always remains dependent upon the will of Lord Viñëu." Similarly the Brahma-saàhitä (5.44) says, såñöi-sthiti-pralaya-sädhana-çaktir ekä chäyeva yasya bhuvanäni bibharti durgä. Mäyä is like a shadow of the Supreme Personality of Godhead who serves Him in the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this world. Just as a shadow has no independent power of movement but follows the substance that casts the shadow, the illusory energy of the Lord has no independent power, but bewilders the living entities according to the Lord's desire. One of Kåñëa's opulences is that He is supremely detached; when a living entity wants to forget Him, Kåñëa immediately employs His illusory energy to facilitate the foolishness of the conditioned soul.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé the words gåhétväpéndriyair arthän indicate that the pure devotee of the Lord does not cease acting within this world; rather, he uses his senses in the service of the Lord of the senses, Håñékeça. Håñékeëa håñékeça-sevanaà bhaktir ucyate [Cc. Madhya 19.170]. Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé has stated that if one gives up those material things which are favorable for serving Kåñëa, considering them material and therefore an impediment to his spiritual advancement, his renunciation is merely phalgu-vairägya, or immature and imperfect renunciation. On the other hand, one who accepts all material things for the service of Kåñëa without any personal desire for sense gratification is actually renounced (yuktaà vairägyam ucyate).</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has warned in his commentary on this verse that by envying any of the three classes of devotees—uttama-adhikäré, madhyama-adhikäré or kaniñöha-adhikäré—one falls down to the platform of impersonalism and loses all power to benefit others or even himself. Therefore those who are trying to advance in Kåñëa consciousness should not endanger their transcendental experience by unnecessarily criticizing other Vaiñëavas. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, if one engages in phalgu-vairägya, or renouncing material things that are favorable to the service of Lord Kåñëa, one runs the risk of being polluted by impersonal philosophy. On the other hand, by sticking to the principle of yukta-vairägya, engaging everything for Kåñëa without personal desire, one can remain aloof from the danger of material sense gratification and gradually come to the mahä-bhägavata platform, as mentioned in this verse.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Within the material world, one's material body is always subject to birth and decay. Similarly, the life air [präëa] is harassed by hunger and thirst, the mind is always anxious, the intelligence hankers for that which cannot be obtained, and all of the senses are ultimately exhausted by constant struggle in the material nature. A person who is not bewildered by the inevitable miseries of material existence, and who remains aloof from them simply by remembering the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is to be considered bhägavata-pradhäna, the foremost devotee of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Madhväcärya there are three classes of intelligent living beings within this world, namely the demigods, ordinary human beings, and demons. A living being endowed with all auspicious qualities—in other words, a highly advanced devotee of the Lord—either on the earth or in the higher planetary systems is called a deva, or demigod. Ordinary human beings generally have good and bad qualities, and according to this mixture they enjoy and suffer on the earth. But those who are distinguished by their absence of good qualities and who are always inimical to pious life and the devotional service of the Lord are called asuras, or demons.</div>
<div class="First"> Of these three classes, the ordinary human beings and demons are terribly afflicted by birth, death and hunger, whereas the godly persons, the demigods, are aloof from such bodily distress. The demigods remain aloof from such distress because they are enjoying the results of their pious activities; by the laws of karma, they are unaware of the gross suffering of the material world. As</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">the Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä (9.20),</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">trai-vidyä mäà soma-päù püta-päpä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yajïair iñövä svar-gatià prärthyante</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">te puëyam äsädya surendra-lokam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">açnanti divyän divi deva-bhogän</div>
<div class="First"> "Those who study the Vedas and drink the soma juice, seeking the heavenly planets, worship Me indirectly. They take birth on the planet of Indra, where they enjoy godly delights." But the next verse of Bhagavad-gétä says that when one uses up the results of these pious activities, one has to forfeit his status as a demigod, along with the pleasure of the heavenly kingdom, and return to earth as a nara, or ordinary human being (kñéëe puëye martya-lokaà viçanti [Bg. 9.21]). In fact the laws of nature are so subtle that one may not even return to earth as a human, but may take birth as an insect or tree, depending on the particular configuration of his karma.</div>
<div class="First"> The pure devotee of the Lord, however, does not experience material misery, because he has given up the bodily concept of life and identifies himself correctly as an eternal servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. As stated by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gétä (9.2), susukhaà kartum avyayam. Even in the stage of regulative practice, the process of bhakti-yoga is very joyful. Similarly, Locana däsa Öhäkura, a near contemporary of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, said, saba avatära sära çiromaëi kevala änanda-käëòa. Although there are various käëòas, or divisions, of Vedic discipline, such as karma-käëòa (fruitive ceremonies) and jïäna-käëòa (regulated speculation), Caitanya Mahäprabhu's hari-näma saìkértana movement is kevala änanda-käëòa, the pathway of pure bliss. Simply by chanting the holy names of Kåñëa, eating the remnants of sumptuous food offered to the Supreme Lord and hearing the enchanting pastimes of the Personality of Godhead, one merges into an ocean of bliss called Kåñëa consciousness.</div>
<div class="First"> Fortunately this blissful ocean is the eternal situation of every living entity, provided he gives up all of his bogus concepts of life. One should not identify himself as a gross material body, nor as a fickle mind, nor as speculative intelligence, nor should one foolishly identify himself with the so-called void of Buddhist imagination. Nor should one even identify himself with the ocean of impersonal spiritual life called the brahmajyoti, which illuminates the great outdoors of the spiritual sky beyond the covered universe. One should rather identify himself correctly as an eternal individual servant of the supreme individual Personality of Godhead. By this simple admission of one's constitutional position and by sincere engagement in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord, one is quickly promoted to direct participation in the eternal pastimes of Kåñëa, just as Arjuna got the opportunity to play with Kåñëa as a soldier on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Madhväcärya has given an elaborate description of the process by which material miseries arise. When a conditioned soul of demoniac mentality identifies himself with the gross material body, he undergoes miseries of constant drowsiness and unquenchable sexual desires that burn all mental peace and serenity to ashes. When a demoniac person identifies himself with präëa, the life air, he suffers from hunger, and by identifying himself with the mind he suffers panic, fear, and hankering that ends in disappointment. When he identifies himself with intelligence, he suffers profound existential bitterness and frustration deep within his heart. When he identifies himself with the false ego, he feels inferiority, thinking, "I am so low." And when he identifies himself with the process of consciousness, he is haunted by memories of the past. When a demon tries to impose himself as the ruler of all living beings, all of these miseries expand simultaneously.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çrépäda Madhväcärya, sinful life is the demoniac standard for happiness. We can observe that in demoniac societies the dark, late hours of night are considered most appropriate for recreational activity. When a demon hears that someone is rising at four o'clock in the morning to take advantage of the godly early-morning hours, he is astonished and bewildered. Therefore it is</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">said in Bhagavad-gétä (2.69),</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yä niçä sarva-bhütänäà</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">yasyäà jägrati bhütäni</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sä niçä paçyato muneù</div>
<div class="First"> "What is night for all beings is the time of awakening for the self-controlled; and the time of awakening for all beings is night for the introspective sage." Çréla Prabhupäda has commented, "There are two classes of intelligent men. The one is intelligent in material activities for sense gratification, and the other is introspective and awake to the cultivation of self-realization." Thus the more one can increase illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling, the more one advances his prestige in a demoniac society, whereas in a godly society based on Kåñëa consciousness these things are abolished completely. Similarly, as one becomes blissfully attached to the holy name and pastimes of Kåñëa, one becomes more and more alienated from the demoniac society. The demons are self-proclaimed enemies of the Supreme Lord, and they mock His kingdom. Thus they are described by Çréla Madhväcärya as adho-gateù, or those who have purchased their tickets to the darkest regions of hell. On the other hand, if one is undisturbed by the miseries of material life, he is on the same spiritual level as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">stated in Bhagavad-gétä (2.15),</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yaà hi na vyathayanty ete</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">puruñaà puruñarñabha</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sama-duùkha-sukhaà dhéraà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">so 'måtatväya kalpate</div>
<div class="First"> "O best among men [Arjuna], the person who is not disturbed by happiness and distress and is steady in both is certainly eligible for liberation." One can come to this transcendental stage only by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the words of Çré Madhväcärya, sampürëänugrahäd viñëoù. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has described the process by which one becomes an uttama-adhikäré If one is fortunate, he gradually becomes disgusted with the limited vision and activities of the kaniñöha-adhikäré and learns to appreciate the expanded vision of the madhyama-adhikäré, who is able to recognize that every living entity should become a devotee of Kåñëa and that one achieves the perfection of life by following in the footsteps of an uttama-adhikäré devotee of the Lord. As one's devotional service gradually intensifies and one repeatedly bathes in dust from the lotus feet of a pure devotee, the harassment of birth, death, hunger, thirst, fear and so on gradually cease disturbing the mind. As stated in</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu (1.2.114),</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">alabdhe vä vinañöe vä</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">aviklava-matir bhütvä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">harim eva dhiyä smaret</div>
<div class="First"> "Even if a devotee is frustrated in his attempt to eat properly or clothe himself properly, he should not allow this material failure to disturb his mind; rather, he should use his intelligence to remember his master, Lord Kåñëa, and thus remain undisturbed." As one becomes mature in this process of remembering Kåñëa in all circumstances, he is awarded the title mahä-bhägavata. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta gives the example that just as a child's ball may be fastened to the end of a rope so that it cannot bounce away, a devotee who surrenders to Kåñëa becomes tied to the rope of Vedic injunctions and is never lost in worldly affairs. In this connection Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has quoted from the Åg Veda (1.156.3) as follows: oà äsya jänanto näma cid vivaktan mahas te viñëo su-matià bhajämahe oà tat sat. "O Viñëu, Your name is completely transcendental. Thus it is self-manifest. Indeed, even without properly understanding the glories of chanting Your holy name, if we vibrate Your name with at least a small understanding of its glories—that is, if we simply repeat the syllables of Your holy name—gradually we shall understand it." The supreme entity indicated by the praëava oà is sat, or self-revealing. Therefore, even if one is disturbed by fear or envy, the transcendental form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead will become manifest to one who continues to chant the Lord's holy name. Further evidence is given in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (6.2.14):</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> One who has taken exclusive shelter of the Supreme Lord, Väsudeva, becomes free from fruitive activities, which are based on material lust. In fact, one who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord is freed from even the desire to enjoy material sense gratification. Plans for enjoying sex life, social prestige and money cannot develop within his mind. Thus he is considered bhägavatottama, a pure devotee of the Lord on the highest platform.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, this verse describes the behavior of a devotee of the Lord. The activities of a pure devotee are devoid of material envy, false elation, delusion and lust. According to the Vaiñëava commentators, the word béjänäm in this verse refers to väsanäù, or deeply rooted desires, which gradually fructify in the form of activities, for which the living entity becomes subject to reactions. Thus the compound word käma-karma-béjänäm indicates the deep-rooted desire to lord it over the material world through the enjoyment of sexual pleasure and the expansions of sexual pleasure mentioned in the Bhägavatam (5.5.8) as gåha-kñetra-sutäpta-vittaiù, that is, a beautiful residential building and ample land for producing sumptuous food to fill the belly, as well as children, friends, social contacts and a large bank balance. All of these material items are essential for completely forgetting that one is an eternal servant of the Supreme Lord. Therefore as stated in the Bhägavatam, janasya moho 'yam ahaà mameti: [SB 5.5.8] intoxicated by these objects of material illusion, the conditioned soul becomes madly convinced that he is the center of the universe and that everything in existence has been created only for his personal sense gratification. Whoever obstructs such illusory enjoyment becomes immediately his enemy and subject to be killed. Because of this bodily concept of life and the shackles of illusion, the whole world is being violently shaken by conflict arising from envy and lust. The only possible solution is to accept the leadership of the Lord's pure devotees, who are described here. A popular expression used to justify democratic government is "Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely." Such homilies may be valid on the material platform, but it is specifically mentioned here that a pure devotee of the Lord who has completely taken shelter of the Lord's lotus feet cannot even consider taking part in material envy and sense gratification. His mind remains perpetually clear and sober, and he is always aware of the ultimate good of every living entity. The Kåñëa consciousness movement is strenuously endeavoring to inform the earth's suffering living entities of the serious need for a brain in human society. A brain racked by fever cannot give proper direction, and if the so-called thinkers of society are burning with selfish desires, they are no better than feverish, delirious brains. Delirious governments are gradually destroying all traces of happiness in human society. Therefore it is the duty of Vaiñëava preachers to act on the platform of bhägavatottama so that they can give clear guidance to humanity, without being corrupted or even slightly attracted by the material opulence that may be offered to a saintly person. All intelligent human beings who are unable to take directly to the process of bhakti-yoga should at least be sufficiently educated to recognize the first-class devotee of the Lord and accept his guidance. In this way human society can be very nicely organized so that not only all human beings but even the animals, birds and trees can make advancement in life and gradually go back home, back to Godhead, for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has emphasized that those seriously interested in achieving the perfection of Kåñëa consciousness must live in a community of Vaiñëavas. Çréla Prabhupäda has also mentioned several times in his literature that it is not possible to achieve the stage of perfect Kåñëa consciousness unless one accepts the shelter of the pure devotees by living in the Kåñëa conscious communities being established all over the world by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has emphasized that this does not mean that spiritual life is restricted only to those celibate students who can live within a temple compound. Devotees in the gåhastha order, that of spiritual family life, can also take shelter of the Vaiñëava community by regularly attending temple functions. Those who are living in family life should daily see the Deity of the Supreme Lord, chant His holy names in His personal presence, accept the remnants of food offered to the Deity and hear learned discourses on Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Any householder who regularly takes advantage of these spiritual facilities and follows the regulative principles of spiritual life, namely no meat-eating, no illicit sex, no gambling and no intoxication, is to be considered a bona fide member of the Vaiñëava community. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, those who remain inimical to the devotional service of the Lord are to be considered lifeless puppets in the hands of the illusory energy of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Birth in an aristocratic family and the execution of austere and pious activities certainly cause one to take pride in himself. Similarly, if one enjoys a prestigious position within society because his parents are highly respected members of the varëäçrama social system, one becomes even more infatuated with himself. But if despite these excellent material qualifications one does not feel even a tinge of pride within himself, he is to be considered the dearmost servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, the word janma ("good birth") refers to such classes as the mürdhävasiktas (children of brähmaëa fathers and kñatriya mothers) and ambañöhas (children of brähmaëa fathers and vaiçya mothers), both of which are considered anuloma since the father comes from a higher caste. Marriages in which the mother comes from a higher class than the father are called pratiloma. In any case, one who becomes proud of his so-called prestigious birth is certainly in the bodily concept of life. Birth in any material body is a serious problem, which one should solve by surrendering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can thereby release himself from the golden shackles of a so-called aristocratic material body. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, kaniñöha-adhikärés think that karma-miçra bhakti, or devotional service mixed with material endeavor, is the ultimate in spiritual life. They become attached to verses such as this:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">varëäçramäcära-vatä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">puruñeëa paraù pumän</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">viñëur ärädhyate panthä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nänyat tat-toña-käraëam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">[Cc. Madhya 8.58]</div>
<div class="First"> "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viñëu, is worshiped by the proper execution of prescribed duties in the system of varëa and äçrama. There is no other way to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One must be situated in the institution of the four varëas and äçramas." (Viñëu Puräëa 3.8.9) Thus they think that material work in which a portion of the fruits are offered to God forms the highest platform of human life. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, there are several småti literatures that have encouraged such mixed devotional service. Such books are taken by materialistic devotees as facility for offending the holy name of the Lord because of egotistic attachment to the material body. Thus one thinks that a prestigious position in the varëäçrama system according to birth and so-called pious activities is a prerequisite for becoming successful in life. But those who have actually taken shelter of the holy name of Kåñëa never boast about their birth in the material world, nor do they pride themselves on their so-called expertise in material work. As long as one's mentality is encumbered by the material designations of the varëäçrama system, one has very little chance of becoming free from material bondage and establishing himself as dear to the Lord. In this regard, Caitanya Mahäprabhu emphatically declared that He could not identify Himself with any varëäçrama designation, such as that of a great intellectual or priest, a courageous warrior in the Lord's army, a brilliant businessman making money for the Lord, or the hardest worker for the Lord. Nor could Caitanya Mahäprabhu identify Himself as a stalwart brahmacäré, a noble householder or an exalted sannyäsé. These designations reflect the material pride that can infiltrate the execution of devotional service. Although a devotee may carry out the standard duties of varëäçrama, his only designation is gopé-bhartuù pada-kamalayor däsa-däsänudäsaù [Cc. Madhya 13.80], the eternal servant of the servant of the servant of the Lord, the master of the gopés, Kåñëa.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, when a devotee understands that the process of bhakti-yoga is complete in itself and he becomes absorbed in hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord, the supremely merciful Personality of Godhead affectionately lifts such a first-class devotee onto His own lap. The Supreme Lord can be pleased only by unalloyed devotion, and not by any arrangement of the gross body, composed of five material elements, or the subtle body, composed of innumerable speculations and bogus pride. In other words, Lord Kåñëa can never be pleased by one's so-called aristocratic body, which is due to be devoured by worms or vultures. If one becomes proud of his material birth and so-called pious activities, by such false pride one gradually develops the impersonal mentality of merely renouncing the fruit of work or else the karmé mentality of enjoying the fruits of work. Neither the karmés nor the jïäné speculators are aware that the fruit of work actually belongs to Kåñëa. The conclusion is that one should carefully give up all false pride and always remember that he is a humble servant of Kåñëa. As stated by Caitanya Mahäprabhu, amäninä mänadena kértanéyaù sadä hariù [Cc. Ädi 17.31].</div>

Such a satisfied Vaiñëava is considered to be at the highest standard of devotional service.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The vision described by the phrase sarva-bhüta-samaù, "seeing all living entities equally," does not include one's vision of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this connection Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted from the Haré-vaàça as follows:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na kväpi jévaà viñëutve</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">saàsåtau mokña eva ca</div>
<div class="First"> "Under no circumstance should one consider the living entity equal to Lord Viñëu, either in conditional life or in liberation." The impersonal speculative philosophers are fond of imagining that although in our present illusion we appear to be individual entities, at liberation we shall all merge into God and be God. Such wishful thinkers cannot reasonably explain how the omnipotent God could arrive at the embarrassing position of having to enter a yoga studio, pay weekly fees, press His nose and chant mantras to regain His divinity. As stated in the Vedas, nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm eko bahünäà yo vidadhäti kämän (Kaöha Upaniñad 2.2.13). The individuality or plurality of living entities is not a product of material existence. The word nityänäm, denoting the plurality of eternal entities, clearly indicates that the living entities are eternally individual parts and parcels of the Lord, who is the singular unique entity described here as ekaù. In Bhagavad-gétä (1.21) Arjuna said to Kåñëa, rathaà sthäpaya me 'cyuta: "My dear Acyuta, please place my chariot between the armies." This body is also ratha, a vehicle, and therefore the best policy is to request the infallible Lord to take charge of our conditioned body and guide us on the path back to the kingdom of God. The word acyuta means "the infallible" or "one who never falls." Learned or sane human beings will not entertain the silly notion that the omnipotent, omniscient God has slipped and fallen because of mäyä. No amount of wishful thinking can erase our eternal servitorship at the lotus feet of the Lord. This fact is stated by the Lord Himself in the Varäha Puräëa:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">naivaà tvayänumantavyaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">jévätmäham iti kvacit</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sarvair guëair su-sampannaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">daivaà mäà jïätum arhasi</div>
<div class="First"> "You should never think Me one of the ordinary living entities in the jéva category. In fact I am the reservoir of all opulences and godly qualities, and therefore you should understand that I am the Supreme Lord." According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé and Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, this verse of Çrémad-Bhägavatam does not forbid using a particular object in the Lord's service, since a devotee is free to use anything favorable for serving Lord Kåñëa. This acceptance of favorable objects in the service of Kåñëa is called yukta-vairägya. As stated by Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé, nirbandhaù kåñëa-sambandhe: one should be attached for Kåñëa's sake, never for one's own sake. If one interprets this verse to indicate that one should not exercise control over any material object, even if it is favorable for serving Kåñëa, one falls into the bad understanding called phalgu-vairägya, or immature renunciation. Great kings such as Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira and Mahäräja Parékñit engaged the entire earth, and other Vaiñëavas have engaged the entire universe in the service of Kåñëa. But they completely gave up the sense of their personal proprietorship. That is the point made in this verse. Just as one becomes very much concerned about any pain in one's own body, one should be concerned with bringing the conditioned souls to the platform of devotional service so that all of their suffering will be banished forever. That is the actual purport of not distinguishing between one body and another.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are sought even by the greatest of demigods, such as Brahmä and Çiva, who have all accepted the Supreme Personality of Godhead as their life and soul. A pure devotee of the Lord can never forget those lotus feet in any circumstance. He will not give up his shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord for a single moment—indeed, not for half a moment—even in exchange for the benediction of ruling and enjoying the opulence of the entire universe. Such a devotee of the Lord is to be considered the best of the Vaiñëavas.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé one may ask, "If one were able to gain the opulence of the entire universe in exchange for leaving the Lord's lotus feet for just half a moment, what would be the harm in leaving the Lord's lotus feet for such an insignificant amount of time?" The answer is given by the word akuëöha-småti. It is simply impossible for a pure devotee to forget the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, since everything that exists is in fact an expansion of the Supreme Lord. Since nothing is separate from the Supreme Lord, a pure devotee of the Lord cannot think of anything but the Lord. Nor can a pure devotee contemplate ruling or enjoying universal opulence; even if given all the opulence of the universe, he would immediately offer it at the lotus feet of the Lord and return to his position of a humble servant of the Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> The words ajitätma-surädibhir vimågyät are very significant in this verse. The lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa are so opulent that even the lords of all material opulence, namely Brahmä and Çiva, as well as the other demigods, are always searching for a glimpse of the Lord's lotus feet. The word vimågyät indicates that the demigods are not actually able to see the lotus feet of the Lord, but are endeavoring to see them. An example of this is given in the Tenth Canto when Lord Brahmä offers prayers to Viñëu, begging the Lord to rectify the disturbances on the earth.</div>
<div class="First"> A similar verse is found elsewhere in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (11.14.14):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na pärameñöhyaà na mahendra-dhiñëyaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na särvabhaumaà na rasädhipatyam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na yoga-siddhér apunar-bhavaà vä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mayy arpitätmecchati mad vinänyat</div>
<div class="First"> "The devotee who has offered his soul to Me does not want anything if it is separate from Me—not the position of the supreme demigod of the universe, Brahmä, nor that of Lord Indra, nor kingship over the entire earth or over the lower planetary systems, nor the mystic perfections of yoga, nor even freedom from the cycle of rebirth."</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the word ajitätmä can also be taken to mean ajitendriyäù, or "those whose senses are uncontrolled." Although the demigods are all to be respected as devotees of Lord Viñëu, the absence of gross material discomfort in the higher planetary systems makes them tend to become affected by the bodily concept of life, and sometimes they experience some spiritual difficulty due to the gorgeous material facilities available to them. Such disturbances, however, cannot exist within the mind of a pure devotee of the Lord, as indicated in this verse by the word akuëöha-småti. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, we can understand from this verse that since none of the material facilities available in any of the universal planetary systems can distract a pure devotee of the Lord, such a devotee can never possibly fall or become inimical to the Lord's service.</div>

<div class="Translation"> How can the fire of material suffering continue to burn the hearts of those who worship the Supreme Lord? The Lord's lotus feet have performed innumerable heroic deeds, and the beautiful nails on His toes resemble valuable jewels. The effulgence emanating from those nails resembles cooling moonshine, for it instantly relieves the suffering within the heart of the pure devotee, just as the appearance of the moon's cooling light relieves the burning heat of the sun.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> When the moon rises, the expansion of its rays drives away the distress of the sun's fierce heat. Similarly, the cooling rays emanating from the lotus nails of the Personality of Godhead's lotus feet vanquish all distress for the Lord's pure devotee. According to the Vaiñëava commentators it is to be understood from this verse that material lust, exemplified by uncontrolled sexual desire, is exactly like a blazing fire. The flames of this fire burn to ashes the peace and happiness of the conditioned soul, who perpetually wanders in 8,400,000 species of life, vainly struggling to extinguish this intolerable fire. The pure devotees of the Lord place the Lord's cooling, jewellike lotus feet within their hearts, and thus all of the pain and suffering of material existence are extinguished.</div>
<div class="First"> The word uru-vikramäìghri indicates that the Lord's lotus feet are quite heroic. Çré Kåñëa is famous for His incarnation as Vämana, the dwarf brähmaëa, who extended His beautiful toes up to the outer limits of the universe and perforated the universal shell, thus bringing the waters of the holy Ganges into the universe. Similarly, when Kåñëa was entering the city of Mathurä to challenge the demoniac King Kaàsa and His entrance was impeded by a ferocious elephant named Kuvalayäpéòa, Lord Kåñëa kicked the elephant to death and peacefully entered the city gates. Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet are so exalted that the Vedic literatures state that the entire material manifestation rests beneath His lotus feet: samäçrétä ye pada-pallava-plavaà mahat padaà puëya-yaço muräreù (SB 10.14.58).</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> The Supreme Personality of Godhead is so kind to the conditioned souls that if they call upon Him by speaking His holy name, even unintentionally or unwillingly, the Lord is inclined to destroy innumerable sinful reactions in their hearts. Therefore, when a devotee who has taken shelter of the Lord's lotus feet chants the holy name of Kåñëa with genuine love, the Supreme Personality of Godhead can never give up the heart of such a devotee. One who has thus captured the Supreme Lord within his heart is to be known as bhägavata-pradhäna, the most exalted devotee of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, the essence of a pure devotee's qualifications is given in this verse. A pure devotee is one who has attracted the Lord by his love so that the Lord cannot give up the devotee's heart. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the word säkñät in this verse indicates that a pure devotee has realized knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, having given his heart to the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, who is all-attractive in six opulences, including beauty. A pure devotee can never be attracted by the fleshy bags of women's breasts or by the hallucinations of so-called society, friendship and love within the material world. Therefore his clean heart becomes a suitable abode for the Supreme Lord. A gentleman will live only in a clean place. He will not live in a polluted, contaminated place. Educated people in the Western countries are now greatly protesting the pollution of water and air by urban industrial enterprises. People are demanding the right to live in a clean place. Similarly, Lord Kåñëa is the supreme gentleman, and therefore He will not live in a polluted heart, nor will He appear within the polluted mind of a conditioned soul. When a devotee surrenders to Lord Kåñëa and becomes a lover of the Lord by direct realization of Kåñëa's all-attractive nature, the Lord makes His residence in the clean heart and mind of such a pure devotee.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, ya etädåça-praëayaväàs tenänena tu sarvadä paramävaçenaiva kértyamänaù sutaräm evam eväghaugha-näçaù syät. If a devotee is absorbed in the loving transcendental service of Kåñëa, directly or indirectly he is always glorifying the Lord by transcendental loving service. Therefore, even if he chants the holy name of Kåñëa with improper attention due to being absorbed in the Lord's service, the mercy of the Lord purifies his heart of all sinful reactions. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (2.1.11):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">etan nirvidyamänänäm</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">icchatäm akuto-bhayam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yoginäà nåpa nirëétaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">harer nämänukértanam</div>
<div class="First"> "O King, constant chanting of the holy name of the Lord after the ways of the great authorities is the doubtless and fearless way of success for all, including those who are free from all material desires, those who are desirous of all material enjoyment, and also those who are self-satisfied by dint of transcendental knowledge." Therefore if one who has not come to the platform of loving devotional service chants the holy name of Kåñëa, he will also be gradually freed from all sinful reactions. In the Sixth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, in the purports to the history of Ajämila, Çréla Prabhupäda has elaborately explained the holy name's potency to purify even an ordinary person.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has nicely explained the process of bringing the Supreme Lord under control. Mother Yaçodä bound the child Kåñëa to a grinding mortar with a rope. Kåñëa, being attracted by the inconceivable love of His devotees, allowed Himself to be bound. Therefore, although Lord Kåñëa binds all the conditioned souls by the chains of His illusory potency, mäyä, if those same conditioned souls become pure devotees of the Lord they can in turn bind Kåñëa by the chains of love of God. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, all the world's inauspicious conditions due to sinful activities can be immediately eradicated by the chanting of the Lord's holy name. The Supreme Personality of Godhead never leaves the hearts of those who give up all sinful behavior and chant His holy name. Even if such chanting is not yet perfect, devotee who always remains in the Lord's service will gradually come to the stage of prema-niñöhä, or steady love of Godhead. Then they are to be considered mahä-bhägavatas, or pure devotees of the Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Second Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Mahäräja Nimi Meets the Nine Yogendras."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 3. Liberation from the Illusory Energy</div>
<div class="First"> In answer to four questions spoken by Mahäräja Nimi, this chapter describes the nature and activities of the illusory potency (mäyä), the method of becoming free from mäyä's insurmountable grip, the transcendental situation of the Supreme Lord Näräyaëa, and the process of karma-yoga, by which one becomes free from all material activities.</div>
<div class="First"> The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the original cause of all causes, created the five material elements, from which the material bodies of the conditioned souls are created so that the conditioned souls may cultivate either sense gratification or ultimate liberation. Appearing as the Supersoul, the Supreme Lord enters the material bodies of the created beings and activates the eleven senses of the conditioned souls. The conditioned soul misidentifies the created material body with his actual self and thus engages in various fruitive activities. Impelled by the reactions of his own activities, he repeatedly takes birth in various species of life and thus suffers greatly until the time of the cosmic annihilation. When the annihilation is imminent, the soul of the universal form withdraws the entire material creation within Himself, and then He Himself enters into the original cause of all causes. In this way the Lord empowers His illusory potency, consisting of the three modes of material nature, for the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the material universe.</div>
<div class="First"> Accepting the roles of male and female in this material world, the conditioned souls unite in sexual relationships. Although these souls constantly make material endeavors to eliminate their unhappiness and unlimitedly increase their pleasure, they inevitably achieve exactly the opposite result.</div>
<div class="First"> Permanent happiness cannot be found in this world-either on the earthly planets or on the heavenly planets, which one can attain in the next life after performing ritualistic ceremonies and sacrifices. Both on earth and in heaven the living entity is harassed by the envy and rivalry of others. Therefore any person who seriously desires. to find permanent relief from the sufferings of material existence should take shelter of the lotus feet of a bona fide spiritual master. The qualification of the bona fide guru is that he has realized the conclusions of the Vedic scriptures by deliberation and is able to convince others of these conclusions. Such great personalities, who have taken shelter of the Supreme Godhead, leaving aside all material considerations, should he understood to be bona fide spiritual masters. Accepting the bona fide spiritual master as one's life and soul, the submissive disciple should learn from him the process of pure devotional service, which satisfies the Supreme Lord. By thus following the path of devotional service, the disciple gradually develops all good qualities. One should hear, glorify and meditate upon the wonderful transcendental activities, appearance, qualities and holy names of the Lord. Whatever one finds pleasing or enjoyable he should immediately offer to the Supreme Lord; even his wife, children, home and very life air should all be offered at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should serve others and also accept instructions from others. Especially, one should serve and learn from those who are pure devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By chanting the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the association of devotees, one becomes satisfied and happy and develops a loving friendship with the devotees. In this way one becomes able to give up material sense gratification, which is the cause of all suffering. When a devotee attains the stage of pure love of Godhead, the hairs of his body stand on end, and he manifests various ecstatic symptoms; he personally meets the Supreme Lord and becomes full of transcendental bliss. By learning the science of devotional service and practically engaging in the devotional service of the Lord, the devotee comes to the stage of love of Godhead. When completely devoted to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Näräyaëa, the devotee easily crosses over the illusory energy, mäyä, which is extremely difficult to cross. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of the creation, maintenance and destruction of the universe, yet He has no prior cause. Situated within the temporary and constantly changing material world, the Supreme Lord remains eternal and unchanging. He cannot be understood by the unaided mind or senses, and He is transcendental to the manifestation of the material world, which takes place as the subtle cause and material effect visible in the appearance of gross material objects. Although He is originally one, by expanding His illusory potency (mäyä) He appears in many different forms. He is always free from birth, growth, decay and death, and He is the Supersoul, the all-pervading witness who perceives the mentalities of all living entities. He is the Supreme Brahman and is known as Näräyaëa. When one seriously engages in devotional service to the lotus feet of Lord Näräyaëa, the impure desires lodged within one's heart as a result of one's previous work within the three modes of material nature are destroyed. When the heart is thus purified, one can directly perceive both the Supreme Lord and one's self as transcendental entities.</div>
<div class="First"> Through authorized study of the transcendental Vedic literature, one can properly understand the meaning of prescribed duties, nonperformance of such duties, and forbidden activities. This difficult subject matter can never be understood by mundane speculation. Vedic injunctions indirectly lead one to the path of ultimate liberation by first prescribing fruitive religious activities, just as a father promises his child candy so that the child will take his medicine. If an ignorant person who has not conquered the material senses does not perform the Vedic injunctions, he will certainly engage in sinful and irreligious activities. Thus his reward will be repeated birth and death. On the other hand, if one executes the regulated activities prescribed in the Vedas, without attachment, and offers the result of such work to the Supreme Lord, one attains perfect freedom from the bondage of material work. The material fruitive results offered in the revealed scriptures are not the actual goal of Vedic knowledge, but are meant for stimulating the interest of the performer. If a conditioned soul worships the Supreme Lord Hari by following the regulations found in Vedic literatures such as the tantras, he will quickly become free from the bondage of false ego.</div>
<div class="First"> When a devotee obtains the mercy of his spiritual master, who reveals to him the injunctions of Vedic scriptures, he worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the particular personal form he finds most attractive. In this way the devotee quickly becomes liberated from all material bondage.</div>

<div class="First"> According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, in this chapter various saintly sons of Åñabhadeva will speak about the illusory energy (mäyä), the means for crossing beyond it, the characteristics of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and prescribed duties for human beings. The forty-eighth verse of the previous chapter stated, viñëor mäyäm idaà paçyan: "A devotee of Kåñëa should see the entire universe to be the illusory potency of the Lord." Therefore King Nimi is now pursuing this subject matter by requesting more detailed information from the saintly Yogendras.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, the demigods, headed by Lord Brahmä, and the human beings of the earth are all driven by their particular desires for material sense gratification. Thus they direct their senses toward research for material knowledge. The subtle celestial senses of the demigods and the gross senses of human beings are all busy in ascertaining the measurements of material sense objects. To understand fully the actual nature of mäyä, the illusory potency, which causes the conditioned souls to become averse to Kåñëa consciousness and surrender to bewildering material manifestations, King Nimi is inquiring from another of the nine Yogendras, Çré Antarékña.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, one may argue that since the symptoms of a pure devotee of the Lord have already been elaborately described, one can perfect his life by advancing to the platform mentioned in the previous verse, and there is no need for further questions. But hari-kathämåtam, topics about the Lord and His devotees, are so pleasing and beautiful that one cannot give up hearing them, even after spiritual liberation. Caitanya Mahäprabhu, in this connection, has quoted the following verse:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ätmärämäç ca munayo</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nirgranthä apy urukrame</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kurvanty ahaitukéà bhaktim</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ittham-bhüta-guëo hariù</div>
<div class="First"> "Those who are self-satisfied and unattracted by external, material desires are also attracted to the loving service of Çré Kåñëa, whose qualities are transcendental and whose activities are wonderful. Hari, the Personality of Godhead, is called Kåñëa because He has such transcendentally attractive features." (SB 1.7.10) Material medicine is not desirable once a disease has been cured, but on the absolute platform the means and the end are not different. So chanting and hearing the glories of Lord Kåñëa are both the means and the end of transcendental bliss.</div>
<div class="First"> King Nimi said to the sages, "You are all great saintly persons absorbed in love of Godhead. Therefore although you will speak about mäyä, or illusion, the conclusion will undoubtedly be Kåñëa consciousness. Please don't think that you have already explained everything to me. The intoxicating nectar of your instructions has left me more eager than ever to hear about the Supreme Personality of Godhead."</div>
<div class="First"> King Nimi was also a great devotee of the Lord, otherwise there would have been no question of his personally conversing with such exalted living entities as the nine Yogendras. But as a humble Vaiñëava he considered himself an ordinary conditioned soul covered by material designations. Thus he showed his eagerness to understand the actual nature of mäyä in order to be safe from her future attempts to place him in the burning fire of material existence.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the illusory energy (mäyä) is explained in this verse through a description of her potencies, namely the modes of material nature. In Bhagavad-gétä Lord Kåñëa has described mäyä as guëamayé, "consisting of the material modes of nature." The material modes of nature are alluded to in this verse by the word uccävacäni, "high and low species of life." Various species of life become manifest, as do varieties of beauty, ugliness, strength, weakness and other characteristics within a particular species, according to the proportionate development of the modes of nature. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä (13.22), käraëaà guëa-saìgo 'sya sad-asad-yoni-janmasu: "This is due to the living being's association with material nature in good and evil species." Similarly we find this statement:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ürdhvaà gacchanti sattva-sthä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">madhye tiñöhanti räjasäù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">jaghanya-guëa-våtti-sthä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">adho gacchanti tämasäù</div>
<div class="First"> "Those situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the higher planets, those in the mode of passion live on the earthly planets, and those in the mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds." (Bg. 14.18) The three general divisions of material life are called deva, tiryak and nara—that is, demigods subhuman creatures and human beings. In the various species of life there are various facilities for material sense gratification. Different species are distinguished by differently formed senses, such as the genitals, nostrils, tongue, ears and eyes. Pigeons, for example, are given the facility for almost unlimited sex. Bears have an ample opportunity for sleeping. Tigers and lions exhibit the propensities for fighting and meat-eating, horses are distinguished by their legs for swift running, vultures and eagles have keen eyesight, and so on. The human being is distinguished by his large brain, which is meant for understanding God.</div>
<div class="First"> The phrase sva-mäträtma-prasiddhaye is very significant in this verse. The word sva indicates possession. All living beings belong to the Supreme Lord (mamaiväàço jéva-loke jéva-bhütaù sanätanaù [Bg. 15.7]). Therefore according to this verse they have two options-mäträ-prasiddhaye and ätma-prasiddhaye. Mäträ refers to the material senses, and prasiddhaye refers to effective accomplishment. Therefore mäträ-prasiddhaye means "efficiently engaging in sense gratification."</div>
<div class="First"> On the other hand, ätma-prasiddhaye refers to Kåñëa consciousness. There are two categories of ätmä—the jévätmä, or ordinary living entity, who is dependent, and the Paramätmä, the supreme living entity, who is independent. Some living entities desire to understand both categories of ätma, and in this verse the word ätma-prasiddhaye indicates that the material world is created to give those living entities the opportunity to achieve such an understanding and thus return to the kingdom of God, where life is eternal and full of bliss and knowledge.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Çrédhara Svämé confirms this by quoting a verse from the veda-stuti of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (10.87.2):</div>

<div class="First"> "The Lord created the intelligence, senses, mind and vital air of the living beings for sense gratification, for performing sacrifices to attain higher births, and ultimately for offering sacrifices to the Supreme Soul." According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the actual purpose of the Lord's creation is only one: to facilitate the advancement of devotional service to the Lord Himself. Although it is stated that the Lord facilitates sense gratification, it should be understood that the Supreme Personality of Godhead does not ultimately condone the foolishness of the conditioned souls. The Lord facilitates sense gratification (mäträ-prasiddhaye) so that the living entities will gradually understand the futility of trying to enjoy without Him. Every living entity is part and parcel of Kåñëa. In the Vedic literature the Lord gives a regulative program so that the living beings can gradually exhaust their tendencies to be foolish and learn the value of surrender unto Him. The Lord is undoubtedly the reservoir of all beauty, bliss and satisfaction, and it is the duty of every living entity to engage in the loving service of the Lord. Although there are apparently two purposes for creation, it should be understood that ultimately the purpose is one. The arrangement for sense gratification is ultimately meant to bring the living entities to the single purpose of going back home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> The Supersoul enters the material bodies of the created beings, activates the mind and senses, and thus causes the conditioned souls to approach the three modes of material nature for sense gratification.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The following is a summary of Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura's commentary on this verse.</div>
<div class="First"> The one Supersoul enters the gross material elements (earth, water, fire, air and ether) and uses the activated material mind to subtly divide the sensory activities of the conditioned souls among the five knowledge-acquiring senses (the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin) and, by a further gross division, the five working senses (the hands, legs, speech, genitals and anus). Because liberated souls have a strong tendency to serve the Lord, they are not attracted by the dualities of material good and evil. They derive their pleasure through devotion and love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who eternally enjoys His own transcendental pastimes beyond the material manifestation. When the conditioned souls forget their loving relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they develop illicit desires. Therefore, unable to serve the form, taste, fragrance and other aspects of Lord Viñëu, these souls become bound to the bitter fruits of fruitive activities. But if their love of Godhead is somehow or other awakened, the conditioned souls can dovetail all their sensory activities in the service of the Lord's transcendental pastimes.</div>
<div class="First"> Actually, all materialistic activities are most undesirable. But the conditioned soul, under the influence of illusion, sees apparent distinctions between good and bad, pleasing and displeasing, and so on. The Lord, the Supersoul, having entered the collective and individual consciousness of the living entities, knows the heart of everyone. Therefore when a sincere soul aspires for spiritual perfection, the Lord frees him from material bondage and arouses his propensity to serve the Lord of Vaikuëöha. Love of Godhead flourishes in the variegated flavors of transcendental enjoyment. In ignorance, however, the conditioned soul considers himself the proper object of service and thus misunderstands the entire existential situation.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> The individual living being, the master of the material body, uses his material senses, which have been activated by the Supersoul, to try to enjoy sense objects composed of the three modes of nature. Thus he misidentifies the created material body with the unborn eternal self and becomes entangled in the illusory energy of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In this verse the living entity is called prabhuù, or "master," because he is a minute part and parcel of the supreme master, Kåñëa. Similarly, in Bhagavad-gétä (15.8) the Lord has described the living entity as éçvaraù, "the controller."</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">çaréraà yad aväpnoti</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yac cäpy utkrämatéçvaraù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">gåhétvaitäni saàyäti</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">väyur gandhän iväçayät</div>
<div class="First"> "The living entity in the material world carries his various conceptions of life from one body to another as the air carries aromas." Çréla Prabhupäda has commented in his purport, "Here the living entity is described as éçvaraù, the controller of his own body. If he likes, he can change his body to a higher grade, and if he likes he can move to a lower class. Minute independence is there. The change his body undergoes depends upon him." This statement confirms the words sva-mäträ and ätma-prasiddhaye in text 3 of this chapter. If the Supreme Lord were to interfere with the minute independence of the living entity, there would be no question of the living entity's engaging in the loving service of the Lord, since love implies a spontaneous free choice by the lover. Here the word prabhuù indicates that just as a child, having received a toy car from his father, pedals on the sidewalk, imitating the father, who drives an actual car, the living entity pedals around the material universe in the innumerable material bodies selected for him by the Supreme Lord from an assortment of 8,400,000 species. Thus the living entity, infatuated with the false ego of the material body, creates a fearful situation in which he undergoes repeated birth and death, as described in the statement bhayaà dvitéyäbhiniveçataù syät (SB 11.2.37).</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has given another explanation for this verse. If the word prabhuù is taken to mean the Supreme Lord, the word guëaiù can be understood to mean "good qualities," since guëa can refer to the material modes of nature or to admirable qualities (as in the verse yasyästi bhaktir bhagavaty akiïcanä sarvair guëais tatra samäsate suräù [SB 5.18.12]). This verse would then mean that the Lord, by His transcendental qualities (guëaiù), such as mercy, is able to relish the transcendental qualities (guëän) of His pure devotees. Ätma-pratyoditaiù would then indicate that by surrendering unto the Lord, who is the reservoir of all good qualities, the pure devotees become similarly endowed with godly qualities. The words manyamäna idaà såñöam ätmänam would indicate that the Lord accepts the body of His pure devotee to be on the same spiritual level as He Himself, as indicated in the verse äcäryaà mäà vijänéyän nävamanyeta karhicit [SB 11.17.27]. The Lord is attracted by the loving devotional service of His pure devotees and thus becomes entangled in the network of their loving relationship with Him. For example, after the Battle of Kurukñetra, when Kåñëa was leaving for His own city, Dvärakä, the loving appeal of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira forced the Lord to remain for several more weeks in Hastinäpura. Similarly, when the elderly gopés of Våndävana clapped their hands, Kåñëa would dance like a puppet, keeping time to their rhythm. In relation to this subject matter, Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has quoted a verse from Çrémad-Bhägavatam (9.4.68):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sädhavo hådayaà mahyaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sädhünäà hådayaà tv aham</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mad-anyat te na jänanti</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nähaà tebhyo manäg api</div>
<div class="First"> "The pure devotee is always within the core of My heart, and I am always in the heart of the pure devotee. My devotees do not know anything but Me, and I do not know anyone but them."</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura the word prabhuù may also be understood as follows. The word pra indicates prakarñeëa, or "excessively," and bhü indicates bhavati, or "taking birth." Thus prabhuù indicates prakarñeëa deva-tiryag-ädiñu bhavatéti saù, or repeatedly taking birth among the demigods, animals, human beings and other forms of life. Confirming the statement by Çréla Jéva Gosvämé concerning the Lord's attachment to the spiritualized body of a pure devotee, Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has quoted the following verses from Caitanya-caritämåta (Antya 4.192-93):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">dékñä-käle bhakta kare ätma-samarpaëa</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sei-käle kåñëa täre kare ätma-sama</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Impelled by deep-rooted material desires, the embodied living entity engages his active sense organs in fruitive activities. He then experiences the results of his material actions by wandering throughout this world in so-called happiness and distress.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The argument may be given that if a living entity were subject to the results of his previous activities there would be no scope for free will; once having committed a sinful action, the living entity would be bound in an endless chain of suffering, being perpetually subject to previous reactions. According to this speculation there cannot be a just and omniscient God, since the living entity is forced to commit sinful activities by the reactions of his previous activities, which were reactions to still previous activities. Since even an ordinary gentleman will not unfairly punish an innocent person, how could there be a God witnessing the helpless suffering of the conditioned souls within this world?</div>
<div class="First"> This foolish argument can easily be refuted by a practical example. If I purchase a ticket for an airline flight, board the plane and commence the flight, once the plane has taken off my decision to board the plane forces me to continue flying until the plane lands. But although I am forced to accept the reaction of this decision, on board the plane I have many new decisions I can make. I may accept the food and drink from the stewardesses or reject it, I may read a magazine or newspaper, I may sleep, walk up and down the aisle, converse with other passengers and so on. In other words, although the general context—flying to a particular city—is forcibly imposed upon me as a reaction to my previous decision to board the plane, even within that situation I am constantly making new decisions and creating new reactions. For example, if I cause a disturbance on the airplane I may be arrested when the plane lands. On the other hand, if I make friends with a businessman sitting next to me on the plane, such a contact may lead to a favorable business transaction in the future.</div>
<div class="First"> Similarly, although the living entity is forced to accept a particular body by the laws of karma, within the human form of life there is always scope for free will and decision-making. Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be considered unjust for holding the living entity in human life responsible for his present activities despite the living entity's undergoing the reactions of his previous work.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura the influence of mäyä is so strong that even in a hellish condition the proud conditioned soul thinks that he is enjoying life.</div>

<div class="First"> In the Third Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam Lord Kapiladeva teaches that the material nature originally exists in an inert state of equilibrium called pradhäna. When Lord Viñëu casts His potent glance in the form of käla, or time, material interactions take place, culminating in the variegated creation of the material cosmos. In this verse it is stated that at the end of universal time the same käla that originally incited the female nature into manifestation again withdraws the cosmos into its original state of inert nonmanifestation. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, the time potency itself, käla, is then withdrawn, and it merges into the Supreme Soul, who manifests Himself as the original cause of material nature (anädir ädir govindaù sarva-käraëa-käraëam [Bs. 5.1]).</div>
<div class="First"> Such technical arrangements for creation and annihilation, birth and death, do not exist in the eternal spiritual kingdom of God. In the spiritual sky the variegated spiritual enjoyment of the Lord and His devotees is not hampered by the inferior cycles of birth, maintenance and destruction found in the material world.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura the word vairäjaù in this verse indicates the totality of the individual conditioned souls who originally take birth from Brahmä and are amalgamated back into him at the time of annihilation. By the manifestation of the viräö-puruña, the universal form of the Lord, there is a temporary display of forms, qualities and activities within the material creation. But the entire cosmic scene reverts to inert formlessness when the creation is withdrawn by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Lord's universal form cannot be accepted as an eternal form of the Lord. It is merely the temporary imaginary resemblance of His personal form within the kingdom of mäyä. In the First Canto of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, as well as in the Second Canto, the universal form of the Lord is clearly explained to be an imaginary form offered to the neophyte for meditation on God. Those who are excessively materialistic are totally unable to understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is actually sac-cid-änanda-vigraha [Bs. 5.1], or the eternal form of bliss and knowledge, transcendental to the exhibition of material energy. Therefore to encourage such gross materialists to become faithful theists, the Vedic literature instructs them to meditate upon the physical universe as the gigantic body of the Supreme Lord. This pantheistic conception does not reflect the ultimate reality of the Supreme Lord but is a technique to bring the mind gradually toward God.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has quoted the following verse as evidence that Lord Brahmä is supposed to go back to Godhead at the time of annihilation:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">brahmaëä saha te sarve</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sampräpte pratisaïcare</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">parasyänte kåtätmänaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">praviçanti paraà padam</div>
<div class="First"> "At the time of final annihilation all self-realized souls enter with Brahmä into the supreme abode." Since Brahmä is sometimes considered the best devotee of the Supreme Lord, he surely should obtain liberation rather than merely entering into the unmanifest state of material nature called avyakta. In this connection Çréla Çrédhara Svämé points out that there is a class of nondevotees who attain the planet of Brahmä by performing açvamedha-yajïas and other sacrifices, and in certain cases Brahmä himself may not be a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So the words avyaktaà viçate sükñmam can be understood to indicate that such a nondevotee Brahmä cannot enter the spiritual sky, despite having achieved the ultimate universal status of material expertise. But when Brahmä is a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead the word avyaktam can be taken to indicate the spiritual sky; since the spiritual sky is not manifest to the conditioned souls, it may also be considered avyakta. If even Lord Brahmä cannot enter the kingdom of God without surrendering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then what to speak of other so-called pious or expert nondevotees. In this regard Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has pointed out that there are three categories within the status of Brahmä, namely those of karmé, jïäné and devotee. A Brahmä who is the most exalted karmé of the universe will have to come back to the material world; a living entity who has achieved the post of Brahmä by being the greatest speculative philosopher within the universe may attain impersonal liberation; and a living entity who has been awarded the post of Brahma due to being a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead enters into the personal abode of the Lord. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (3.32.15) yet another case is described: a Brahmä who is a devotee of the Lord but who has the tendency to think himself independent of or equal to the Lord may achieve Mahä-Viñëu's abode at the time of annihilation, but when creation begins again he has to return and again take the post of Brahma. The word used in this case is bheda-dåñöyä, which refers to the tendency to think oneself independently powerful. The various destinations possible for such an exalted living entity as a Lord Brahmä definitely prove that any material position is worthless for guaranteeing an eternal life of bliss and knowledge. In Bhagavad-gétä Lord Kåñëa promises that if one gives up all other so-called obligations and surrenders to the devotional service of the Lord, the Lord will personally protect him and bring him back to the supreme abode in the spiritual sky. It is futile and foolish to try to achieve perfection by one's own strenuous endeavor and not surrender to the lotus feet of Kåñëa. Such a blind attempt is described in the Eighteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä as bahuläyäsam, indicating that it is work in the material mode of passion. Brahmä is the lord of passion, and his creation and management of the entire universe are certainly bahuläyäsam, or strenuous endeavor, in the most exalted sense. But all such passionate work, even that of Lord Brahmä, is ultimately useless without surrender to the lotus feet of Kåñëa.</div>

<div class="Translation"> I have now described mäyä, the illusory energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This illusory potency, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is empowered by the Lord for the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the material universe. Now, what more do you wish to hear?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> King Nimi had expressed to the nava-yogendras his fear of the illusory potency of the Lord and had requested a detailed explanation of mäyä so that he could avoid becoming a victim at her hands. Now, Çré Antarékña, having described the illusory potency, is suggesting that the King inquire about the means to become totally free of mäyä's influence. Not waiting for the King to ask such a question, Çré Antarékña himself is suggesting, "Now that you have heard about mäyä's influence, you should inquire about the process of becoming free of such influence." According to Çrédhara Svämé, that is the significance of Çré Antarékña's question kià bhüyaù çrotum icchasi, "What more do you wish to hear?"</div>
<div class="First"> The following is a summary of Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura's explanation of the process of annihilation described in the previous verses. Väsudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the presiding Deity of consciousness, which becomes manifest within the mahat-tattva. By further transformations of the mahat-tattva the threefold false ego appears as follows. (1) From vaikärika, false ego in the mode of goodness, appears the eleventh sense, the mind, whose presiding Deity is Aniruddha. (2) From taijasa, false ego in the mode of passion, comes intelligence, whose presiding Deity is Pradyumna, and the five working senses and five knowledge-acquiring senses with their various presiding deities. (3) From false ego in the mode of ignorance arises the subtle form of sound, and from that sound, or çabda, all the material elements gradually become manifest, beginning with ether and the sense of hearing. The presiding Deity of these three divisions of false ego is Saìkarñaëa. This description is taken from Chapter 26 of the Third Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, verses 21, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32 and 35. The Supreme Personality of Godhead's external potency, mäyä, causes the birth, maintenance and destruction of the material world. She is tricolored red, white and black. In her red feature the material nature is created, in white it endures, and in black it is annihilated. The mahat-tattva arises from this mäyä, and from the mahat-tattva come the three varieties of false ego mentioned above. At the time of annihilation the five great elements, namely earth, water, fire, air and ether, merge into false ego in the mode of ignorance, from which they were originally generated; the ten senses and intelligence merge into false ego in passion; and the mind, along with the demigods, merges into false ego in the mode of goodness, which then merges into mahat-tattva, which further takes shelter of the prakåti or unmanifest pradhäna. As described above, each of the gross elements is wound up when its distinguishing quality is removed; the element then merges into the previous element. This can be understood as follows. In space or ether there is the quality of sound. In air there are the qualities of sound and touch. In fire there are sound, touch and form. In water there are sound, touch, form and taste. And in earth there are sound, touch, form, taste and aroma. Therefore from ether down to earth each element is distinguished by the addition of its own unique quality, called guëa-viçeñam. When that quality is removed, an element becomes nondifferent from its previous element and thus merges into it. For example, when great winds take aroma away from earth, earth contains only sound, touch, form and taste and thus becomes nondifferent from water, into which it merges. Similarly when water loses its rasa, or taste, it contains only sound, touch and form, thus becoming nondifferent from fire, which also contains those three qualities. So the wind takes away aroma to merge earth into water and takes away taste to merge water into fire. Then when the universal darkness removes form from fire, fire merges into air. Space then removes the sense of touch from air, and air merges into space. The Supreme Personality of Godhead as the time element removes sound from space, and space then merges into the false ego in the mode of ignorance, from which it arose. Finally, false ego is merged into the mahat-tattva, which is merged into the unmanifest pradhäna, and thus the universe is annihilated.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, sthüla-dhiyaù indicates those who ignorantly identify themselves with the gross material body and who are therefore unable to analyze the subtle laws of nature by which the soul transmigrates in illusion. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé comments that sthüla-dhiyaù also indicates so-called pious persons who execute pompous religious ceremonies for material sense gratification rather than trying to prepare themselves to go back home, back to Godhead, by engaging in the loving devotional service of the Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, King Nimi was already an advanced devotee of the Lord and therefore knew that one can cross over the illusory energy, mäyä, by surrendering to the lotus feet of the Lord and pleasing Him by pure devotional service. Therefore the King was asking the question for the benefit of those who falsely consider themselves very much learned but in fact are addicted to materialistic fruitive activities, which increasingly entangle them in illusion. In this regard Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has quoted from the Amara-koça dictionary to show that akåtätmabhiù indicates apürëatvam, or one whose life is empty. Every living being has an eternal relationship with the supreme living being, Kåñëa. One may love Kåñëa by thinking of Him as one's eternal master, one's most intimate friend, one's beloved child or the object of one's conjugal attraction. Of course, such ecstasies should never be confused with ordinary, material emotions, which are perverted reflections of spiritual rasas, or relationships. In the material world we try to relish these same relationships of servitude, friendship, parental love and conjugal love, but the object of such feelings is a temporary material body, which is quickly devastated by the laws of nature. These loving feelings should be directed toward the spiritual body of the Supreme Personality, Kåñëa, who is the reservoir of all beauty and transcendental bliss. One who has not learned the art of directing his love to Kåñëa is apürëa, or one whose life is ultimately empty. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, one whose life is empty can also be called manda-dhéù, or one whose intelligence is crippled by a lack of broad experience. King Nimi, a pure Vaiñëava, was so kind that he asked, "How can such cripple-minded people cross over mäyä in the easiest way possible, since by nature they are very lazy in spiritual matters?"</div>

<div class="Translation"> One cannot find permanent happiness even on the heavenly planets, which one can attain in the next life by ritualistic ceremonies and sacrifices. Even in material heaven the living entity is disturbed by rivalry with his equals and envy of those superior to him. And since one's residence in heaven is finished with the exhaustion of pious fruitive activities, the denizens of heaven are afflicted by fear, anticipating the destruction of their heavenly life. Thus they resemble kings who, though enviously admired by ordinary citizens, are constantly harassed by enemy kings and who therefore never attain actual happiness.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has quoted the following text from the Chändogya Upaniñad (8.1.6): tad yatheha karma-cito lokaù kñéyate, evam evämutra puëya-cito lokaù kñéyate. "One's present status of material pleasure, the result of one's previous work, will eventually be vanquished by time. Similarly, although by executing pious activities one will be elevated to a higher status in the next life, that future situation will also be vanquished." The basis of material enjoyment is the particular body one has acquired. The material body is karma-citaù, the accumulated result of one's previous material activities. If one is awarded a body decorated with beauty, education, popularity, strength and so on, his standard of material enjoyment is certainly high class. On the other hand, if one is ugly, mentally retarded, crippled or repulsive to others, there is very little hope for his material happiness. In both cases, however, the situation is flickering and temporary. One who has acquired an attractive body should not rejoice, since death will quickly bring an end to such an intoxicating situation. Similarly, one who has taken birth in an obnoxious situation should not lament, since his suffering is also temporary. The beautiful man and the ugly man, the rich and the poor, the educated and the foolish should all endeavor to become Kåñëa conscious so that they can be elevated to their eternal constitutional situation, which is to reside in the planets beyond this material universe. Originally every living entity is unimaginably beautiful, intelligent, wealthy, and so strong that his spiritual body lives forever. But we foolishly give up this eternal, blissful situation because we are unwilling to meet the condition for eternal life. The condition is that one should be a lover of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Although love of Kåñëa is the most exquisite ecstasy, surpassing by millions of times the most intense pleasure of the material universe, we foolishly break off our loving affair with the Supreme Lord and artificially try to become independent enjoyers in the material atmosphere of self-delusion and false pride. Even if one reaches the exalted heavenly planets of this universe he will be afflicted by various types of suffering. Every conditioned soul in the material world wants to become the greatest person. Therefore one is constantly harassed by his equals who have a similar desire. This situation is commonly termed the "rat race" of material existence. Even on the heavenly planets there is a similar rat race for heavenly distinction. Since some persons inevitably excel our own achievements, our hearts burn with envy upon seeing others enjoying the very rewards we have strived for. And because our whole situation is temporary, we must undergo fear, anxiety and death even on the heavenly planets. The example given here is very nice. Minor kings may be enviously admired by ordinary citizens for their wealth, power and fame, but such kings themselves constantly burn with jealousy, resentment and fear due to rivalry and threats from other kings. Similarly, modern politicians are constantly harassed by envy and fear.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has pointed out that the conditioned souls, being eager to acquire material happiness and avoid distress, take shelter of sexual relationships and thus surrender to the hard labor of fruitive activities. Those who are enlightened, however, can perceive the ultimate futility of such gross materialistic endeavors. One's so-called wife, home, children, relatives, bank account and so on are all temporary phantasmagoria, and even while manifest they can never give real satisfaction to one's senses. To acquire wealth in this world one is practically forced to become the killer of his own soul. There is no possibility of acquiring pleasure from materialistic activities, since they are performed with temporary senses in the hot pursuit of temporary sense objects. When the conditioned soul achieves his goal he becomes proud and brags to others as if his achievements were permanent. And when defeated he is submerged in lamentation. Such a tendency to consider oneself the doer is a sign of weak intelligence, since in fact the living entity is merely desiring within the material body. The body itself is moved by the forces of material nature, under the control of God. The relationships of master and servant, father and son, husband and wife entail exchanges of well-wishing and service that give a sense of material gratification, but such ephemeral devotion can never bring about the eternal absolute benefit of the soul. By such temporary gratification, mäyä induces the conditioned soul to wander throughout the material world, pursuing the relative rewards of material nature. According to the subtle laws of karma, the living entity achieves happiness and distress. One cannot obtain happiness by force, no matter how strenuously or how long one tries. Therefore those whose intelligence is uncontaminated should surrender at the lotus feet of Kåñëa and give up the ludicrous pursuit of permanent material happiness, a pursuit which can be compared to a dog's chasing its tail.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Therefore any person who seriously desires real happiness must seek a bona fide spiritual master and take shelter of him by initiation. The qualification of the bona fide guru is that he has realized the conclusions of the scriptures by deliberation and is able to convince others of these conclusions. Such great personalities, who have taken shelter of the Supreme Godhead, leaving aside all material considerations, should be understood to be bona fide spiritual masters.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, the word çäbde refers to the Vedic literature, and pare refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The bona fide spiritual master must be niñëätam, deeply experienced in authorized Vedic literatures and in practical understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Without scriptural knowledge and practical realization of the Personality of Godhead, a so-called guru will be unable to dissipate the doubts of his disciples and therefore unable to execute the function of bringing the sincere student back home, back to Godhead. The symptom of realized understanding of the Vedas and Kåñëa is upaçamäçrayam. In other words, the bona fide spiritual master is one who has retired from the glittering illusions of materialistic society, friendship and love.</div>
<div class="First"> Within the material world one is certainly attracted to becoming a great intellectual, a powerful politician, the loving father of many beautiful and affectionate little children, a most honored welfare worker or a highly admired and successful businessman. But none of these material positions have a permanent basis, nor do they afford permanent happiness, because they are all based on the primary misunderstanding by which one identifies himself with the material body.</div>
<div class="First"> Anyone can readily experience that he is not the body but consciousness. Even if one loses a limb of his body, he does not cease to exist as a conscious entity. Ultimately, the entire body is lost at the time of death, and the living entity acquires a new body. The preliminary understanding of one's identity as consciousness is called self-realization. But beyond this elementary knowledge is the elaborate subject matter of how the soul came to exist within the cycle of 8,400,000 material species of life. And if the living entity is not the material body but consciousness, he must ultimately have an original status on a higher platform.</div>
<div class="First"> Punishment implies reward also; a powerful man who can punish is also able to reward. Therefore, the existence of punishment for the living being, who is forced to take a miserable material body subject to birth, old age, disease and death, also logically implies the existence of a reward for him. Although we mistakenly consider material sense gratification the ultimate reward of life, material happiness is actually another type of punishment, since it entices one to continue rotating in the cycle of birth and death. In the Western countries violent prisoners are placed in solitary confinement whereas well-behaved prisoners are sometimes allowed to work in the warden's garden or library as a reward. But any position in prison is ultimately a punishment. Similarly, the existence of higher and lower categories of material sense gratification does not explain the living entity's ultimate reward, which must constitute the natural antithesis of the punishment of material existence. That actual reward is an eternal life of bliss and knowledge in the kingdom of God, where there is no punishment. The kingdom of God is Vaikuëöha, or unconditional pleasure. There is no punishment in the spiritual world; it is a place of ever-increasing pleasure.</div>
<div class="First"> A bona fide spiritual master is one who is expert in all of these subject matters, not by his personal imagination or speculation but by mature understanding of the authorized Vedic literatures, which are the literary manifestation of the causeless mercy of God. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä (9.3).</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">açraddadhänäù puruñä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">dharmasyäsya parantapa</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">apräpya mäà nivartante</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">måtyu-saàsära-vartmani</div>
<div class="First"> "Those who are not faithful on the path of devotional service cannot attain Me, O conqueror of foes, but return to birth and death in this material world." Therefore the spiritual master must awaken the disciple to the eternal existence of devotional service. The example may be given that in the early morning a mother may enter her child's room to wake him up so that he can attend school. The child does not want to get up, but the loving mother forces him to get up and sends him off to school to be educated. Similarly, the bona fide spiritual master awakens the sleeping soul and sends him to the gurukula, or the äçrama of the spiritual master, where he can be trained in perfect knowledge.</div>
<div class="First"> If the disciple has doubts about the value of Kåñëa consciousness, the bona fide spiritual master must dissipate those doubts by superior knowledge. One who himself doubts the authority of Kåñëa or Vedic knowledge cannot become a bona fide spiritual master. On the other hand, kibä vipra, kibä nyäsé, çüdra kena naya/ yei kåñëa-tattva-vettä, sei 'guru' haya: [Cc. Madhya 8.128] any human being from any social or economic status can become a bona fide spiritual master if he knows the science of Kåñëa. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu said,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yäre dekha, täre kaha 'kåñëa'-upadeça</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ämära äjïäya guru haïä tära ei deça</div>
<div class="First"> "Instruct everyone to follow the orders of Lord Çré Kåñëa as they are given in Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam. In this way become a spiritual master and try to liberate everyone in this land." (Cc. Madhya 7.128) Only by the order and authority of the Supreme Lord one can become a spiritual master, not by one's own so-called erudition.</div>
<div class="First"> The duty of the bona fide guru is to connect the disciple to Kåñëa. A scholar or meditator has no potency to connect another living being with Kåñëa if that scholar or meditator himself is not connected with Kåñëa. Although many sports fans attend gymnastic competitions and applaud at the exhibition of difficult calisthenic feats, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not such a gymnastic spectator, and He does not applaud the calisthenics exhibited by foolish persons in the name of yoga. Nor is the Supreme Personality of Godhead impressed by mediocre attempts at philosophical speculation, since the Lord has already given His own opinion in Bhagavad-gétä (çåëu me paramaà vacaù). The word of Kåñëa is paramaà vacaù, the last word in knowledge. And Kåñëa says, yaj jïätvä neha bhüyo 'nyaj jïätavyam avaçiñyate: "When you know this knowledge there shall remain nothing further to be known." Kåñëa has also referred to His knowledge as räja-vidyä, the king of all knowledge.</div>
<div class="First"> If one does not become a lover of Kåñëa, his connection with Kåñëa takes place indirectly, through the illusory potency of the Lord. The idea that one can attract the Supreme Lord through mere gymnastics or foolish speculation on the Absolute Truth is certainly a product of mäyä. One who is connected to Kåñëa through His external, illusory potency can serve only as a material master to connect his so-called disciples to the same illusory energy. On the</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">other hand, in Bhagavad-gétä (9.13) it is said,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mahätmänas tu mäà pärtha</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">daivéà prakåtim äçritäù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhajanty ananya-manaso</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">jïätvä bhütädim avyayam</div>
<div class="First"> Those who are actually great souls have surrendered to the internal potency of the Lord and can similarly connect others to the internal pleasure-giving potency. A mahätmä is described in Bhagavad-gétä as follows: väsudevaù sarvam iti sa mahätmä sudurlabhaù [Bg. 7.19]. "He knows Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare." It is to such a spiritual master, who has reached the mature understanding that Väsudeva is everything, that one must surrender. According to Çré Närada Muni, yo vidvän sa gurur hariù: such a great soul is to be considered the external manifestation of Kåñëa Himself. Kåñëa states this also:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">äcäryaà mäà vijänéyän</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nävamanyeta karhicit</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na martya-buddhyäsüyeta</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sarva-devamayo guruù</div>
<div class="First"> "One should know the äcärya to be My self and never disrespect him in any way. One should not envy him, thinking him an ordinary man, for he is the representative of all the demigods." (SB 11.17.27)</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, if a spiritual master cannot destroy his disciple's doubts by superior knowledge, the disciple will gradually become despondent in spiritual life. Because a bogus guru cannot actually give Kåñëa to the disciple according to the principle of rasa-varjaà raso 'py asya, the disciple will again become attracted to material happiness, not having achieved the bliss of Kåñëa's association. Such a weak disciple of a weak spiritual master will gradually become hopeless and discouraged in his attempt at self-realization and will again become fascinated by the temptations of illusion, such as women, money and so-called intellectuality based on speculation and imagination.</div>
<div class="First"> Further symptoms of the bona fide spiritual master are given in the Upadeçämåta (1) as follows:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">väco vegaà manasaù krodha-vegaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">jihvä-vegam udaropastha-vegam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">etän vegän yo viñaheta dhéraù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sarväm apémäà påthivéà sa çiñyät</div>
<div class="First"> "A sober person who can tolerate the urge to speak, the mind's demands, the actions of anger and the urges of the tongue, belly and genitals is qualified to make disciples all over the world." Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has stated, upaçamäçrayaà krodha-lobhädy-avaçé-bhütam: a bona fide spiritual master cannot be under the control of ordinary anger, greed and lust. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, one who has understood the futility of material existence can approach a bona fide spiritual master. In the two previous verses the futility of earthly and heavenly sense gratification has been described. Now, the natural conclusion is that one who has understood this should approach a bona fide spiritual master. The bona fide spiritual master broadcasts the sound vibration from the spiritual planets called Vaikuëöha. The inhabitants of the spiritual planets, headed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, are certainly not deaf and dumb; they are in constant communication through unlimited transcendental bliss and knowledge. And the bona fide spiritual master can transmit this sound vibration of bliss and knowledge to his disciple. Just as a radio broadcasts mundane news, the bona fide guru broadcasts the news from Vaikuëöha. This is confirmed by Narottama däsa Öhäkura: golokera prema-dhana, hari-näma-saìkértana. The spiritual master also transmits to the disciple the holy name of Kåñëa, which is nondifferent from Kåñëa Himself. The bona fide guru informs his disciple that every living entity is qualitatively one with the Supreme Lord but quantitatively different and thus engages the disciple in the loving service of the Lord. Because the living entity is qualitatively one with the Lord and is part of Him, there is an eternal loving relationship between them. And because the living entity is quantitatively different, that relationship is eternally one of service. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, even though one may have the good fortune to accept a bona fide, highly qualified guru, if one maintains a taste for fruitive activities or mental speculation one's advancement will be checked. But if a serious student surrenders to a bona fide spiritual master there is absolutely no impediment to the transmission of perfect knowledge and bliss in the devotional service of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Accepting the bona fide spiritual master as one's life and soul and worshipable deity, the disciple should learn from him the process of pure devotional service. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, the soul of all souls, is inclined to give Himself to His pure devotees. Therefore, the disciple should learn from the spiritual master to serve the Lord without duplicity and in such a faithful and favorable way that the Supreme Lord, being satisfied, will offer Himself to the faithful disciple.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé the Lord's tendency to give Himself to His pure devotee is demonstrated in the case of Bali Mahäräja, who sacrificed his universal kingdom for the pleasure of Lord Vämanadeva. Lord Vämana was so pleased by the selfless surrender of Bali Mahäräja that the Lord became the doorman in the palace of Bali who was reinstalled as a great leader in the universe.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Jéva Gosvämé comments that the spiritual master is to be considered the ätmä, or the very life, of the disciple, since real life begins when one is initiated by a bona fide spiritual master. Although one may experience many seemingly wonderful or important events in a dream, one's real life begins when he wakes up. Similarly, since the spiritual master gives birth to the disciple by awakening him to spiritual life, a bona fide disciple understands that his spiritual master is the very basis of his life. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the reservoir of all pleasure, and thus the Lord's giving Himself to a pure devotee indicates that such a devotee becomes immersed in the highest possible ecstasy. In this connection there is the following çruti-mantra: änandäd dhémäni bhütäni jäyante. "Indeed, it is from the all-blissful Supreme that all these creatures have come into being." Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has further pointed out that when the Lord bestows His own self upon a pure devotee such a fortunate devotee can actually see the Lord, touch Him and directly engage in His service.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, one should never consider one's spiritual master to be mundane or on an equal level with one's self. One should see the spiritual master as being always under the shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord. One should never try to engage the spiritual master in one's personal service with the mentality of lording it over the spiritual master and attaining through him some material gain. One who is actually advancing will become more and more eager to serve the spiritual master, and thus such a disciple experiences the pleasure of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé has delineated four preliminary requisites for advancement for the sincere disciple:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">guru-pädäçrayas tasmät</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kåñëa-dékñädi-çikñaëam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">viçrambheëa guroù sevä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sädhu-vartmänuvartanam</div>
<div class="First"> "[1] Accepting the shelter of the lotus feet of a bona fide spiritual master, [2] becoming initiated by the spiritual master and learning how to discharge devotional service from him, [3] obeying the orders of the spiritual master with faith and devotion, and [4] following in the footsteps of great äcäryas [teachers] under the direction of the spiritual master." (Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 1.2.74) One who has executed these preliminary duties is qualified to relish Çrémad-Bhägavatam.</div>
<div class="First"> When one actually hears the sound vibration of Çrémad-Bhägavatam as it is, he becomes free from the desire for sense gratification and mental speculation and is happy and satisfied in the service of Lord Kåñëa.</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yasyäà vai çrüyamäëäyäà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kåñëe parama-püruñe</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhaktir utpadyate puàsaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">çoka-moha-bhayäpahä</div>
<div class="First"> "Simply by giving aural reception to Çrémad-Bhägavatam, the feeling for loving devotional service to Lord Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, sprouts up at once to extinguish the fire of lamentation, illusion and fearfulness." (SB 1.7.7) One should hear Çrémad-Bhägavatam from a bona fide spiritual master who can expertly engage the propensity for loving Kåñëa that arises from hearing the transcendental sound of the Bhägavatam. Such a transcendental, authorized engagement is called bhägavata-dharma. Within the International Society for Krishna Consciousness there are many thousands of authorized engagements pertaining to the Society's missionary activities. And by hearing the Çrémad-Bhägavatam and performing such engagements the Society's members feel relief from çoka (lamentation), moha (illusion) and bhaya (fear). According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, those who have achieved a mature understanding of the transcendental sound vibration of Çrémad-Bhägavatam may adopt the order of tridaëòi-sannyäsa, as described in the Haàsa-gétä, the Thirteenth Chapter of this canto. A so-called Vaiñëava who whimsically neglects the strict control of the body, mind and speech cannot actually achieve shelter at the lotus feet of a bona fide spiritual master. Even if such a whimsical sense enjoyer makes a show of assuming the dress and daëòa of Vaiñëava sannyäsa, he will not attain the desired result, love of Kåñëa. A bona fide Vaiñëava should work earnestly to free himself from any tinge of sense gratification and mental speculation, and with a loving heart he should carry out the orders of his bona fide spiritual master. By always remembering the exalted position of the bona fide spiritual master, the disciple will achieve shelter at the lotus feet of Kåñëa.</div>

<div class="Translation"> A sincere disciple should learn to dissociate the mind from everything material and positively cultivate association with his spiritual master and other saintly devotees. He should be merciful to those in an inferior position to him, cultivate friendship with those on an equal level and meekly serve those in a higher spiritual position. Thus he should learn to deal properly with all living beings.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted from the Garuòa Puräëa to demonstrate that within this universe those who take birth as demigods, great åñis or pious human beings are all considered santaù, or saintly persons. According to Bhagavad-gétä, traiguëya-viñayä vedäù: the varëäçrama culture described in Vedic literature deals mostly with the living entities who are struggling within the three modes of nature. The Vedic literatures teach such conditioned souls that material happiness can be achieved only through pious works. In this sense, the demigods are to be considered the most pious living entities within the three modes of material nature. The åñis, or the great saintly mystics of the universe, who are able to travel at will to various planets and who cultivate mystic powers, are to be considered somewhat below the demigods. And those human beings on earth who perfectly execute the Vedic rituals are to be considered in the third or lowest category of santaù, or saintly persons. But a devotee of the Lord is beyond the three modes of material nature. Lord Kåñëa</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">says in Bhagavad-gétä (14.26),</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mäà ca yo 'vyabhicäreëa</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhakti-yogena sevate</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sa guëän samatétyaitän</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">brahma-bhüyäya kalpate</div>
<div class="First"> "One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman." Thus Lord Kåñëa clearly says that a Vaiñëava who does not fall down from the regulations of bhakti-yoga is beyond the three modes of nature. And Lord Kåñëa advised Arjuna, a kåñëa-bhakta, to transcend the three material qualities of the illusory creation of mäyä (nistraiguëyo bhavärjuna). But in the Eighteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä (18.40) the Lord</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">says,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na tad asti påthivyäà vä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">divi deveñu vä punaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sattvaà prakåti-jair muktaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yad ebhiù syät tribhir guëaiù</div>
<div class="First"> "There is no being existing, either here or among the demigods in the higher planetary systems, who is free from the three modes of material nature." Thus the demigods are not exempt from the pollution of the three modes of material nature, whereas a pure devotee actually becomes guëätéta, or transcendental to the influence of mäyä.</div>
<div class="First"> Therefore, one should cultivate the association of the uttama-adhikäré, or pure devotee of the Lord, as stated previously (SB 11.3.21):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tasmäd guruà prapadyeta</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">jijïäsuù çreya uttamam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">çäbde pare ca niñëätaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">brahmaëy upaçamäçrayam</div>
<div class="First"> "Therefore any person who seriously desires real happiness must seek a bona fide spiritual master and take shelter of him by initiation. The qualification of the bona fide guru is that he has realized the conclusions of the scriptures by deliberation and is able to convince others of these conclusions. Such great personalities, who have taken shelter of the Supreme Godhead, leaving aside all material considerations, should be understood to be bona fide spiritual masters."</div>
<div class="First"> On the other hand, one should avoid the association of a materialistic person even if such a person is outwardly chanting the holy names of Kåñëa.</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé has advised in this respect,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kåñëeti yasya giri taà manasädriyeta</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">dékñästi cet praëatibhiç ca bhajantam éçam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">çuçrüñayä bhajana-vijïam ananyam anyanindädi-</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">çünya-hådam épsita-saìga-labdhyä</div>
<div class="First"> One may mentally offer respect to any living entity who is chanting the holy name of Kåñëa, but one should avoid intimate association with materialistic persons, especially those attached to sex enjoyment. Tamo-dväraà yoñitäà saìgi-saìgam. If one associates with a sensuous person who is attached to the company of women, by such association one will surely go to hell. But if a materialistic person approaches a pure devotee with a sincere desire to hear from him about spiritual improvement, that first-class devotee may mercifully give his association, provided the purpose of such a meeting is advancement in the devotional service of Kåñëa. By such association even a materialistic person can gradually become a pure devotee of Kåñëa. If an advanced devotee is not able to engage a materialistic person in the devotional service of Kåñëa, such association is strictly forbidden.</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">In the Garuòa Puräëa it is stated,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">viçeñataù svottameñu</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">vinä saìgaà na mucyate</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sva-néceñu tu deveñu</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">vinä saìgaà na püryate</div>
<div class="First"> "One cannot be liberated without association with a pure devotee of the Lord. And unless one shows mercy to those in an inferior position, one's life will be superficial." It is our practical experience in the Kåñëa consciousness movement that those who are expanding their mercy by preaching the message of Kåñëa are making rapid spiritual progress, and their life is filled with transcendental bliss. Those who neglect the quality of mercy, being uninterested in the missionary activities of the Kåñëa consciousness movement, are not filled with transcendental pleasure as described here by the word püryate. Not being filled with spiritual pleasure, surely such persons attempt to fill their lives with material pleasure through sense gratification and mental speculation, associating with women or reading innumerable mundane novels, newspapers, newsmagazines, and so on. According to Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu the preaching activities of the Kåñëa consciousness movement are änandämbudhi-vardhanam, the ever-increasing ocean of bliss. Missionary activities are based on the principle of dayäm, or mercy to those who are fallen. Those who are actually preaching become enlivened by associating with other preachers. This principle is called maitrém, or friendship among equals. The power to carry out such preaching activities, as well as the proper guidance for distributing Kåñëa's message, comes through the principle of praçrayam, or humble service at the lotus feet of spiritual authorities such as the spiritual master. If one preaches Kåñëa consciousness sincerely under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master and in the company of fellow preachers, one is perfectly fulfilling the statement of this verse of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, and thus he will come to the point of sarvato manaso 'saìgam, or complete detachment from the illusory energy of the Lord. Caitanya Mahäprabhu has stated, lava-mätra sädhu-saìge sarva-siddhi haya [Cc. Madhya 22.54]. By becoming attached to the devotees of the Lord, one will achieve all perfection in life, going back home, back to Godhead. If one neglects the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by engaging in sinful life, he is certainly not merciful. One who ignores his eternal status as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and who instead covers himself more and more with material illusions in the form of temporary designations—"I am American," "I am Russian," "I am Indian," "I am black," "I am white" and so on—is certainly a killer of his own soul and cannot be considered merciful. Similarly, those who support animal slaughter by eating meat, fish and eggs cannot be considered merciful. Sometimes the argument is given that if one does not harm others he is perfectly religious. But because we are now in a state of ignorance, we have no idea whatsoever of the future reactions to our present activities. Ignorantly boasting that one is not harming others, without an awareness of the subtle laws of nature, does not make one a religious person. One becomes religious by surrendering to the laws of God as they are stated by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gétä. As long as a living entity is infatuated with his own mental speculations, which carry him away like the waves of the ocean, he cannot understand the process of devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Mental speculations based on our experience of the variegated creations of the Lord's illusory energy are incapable of bringing us to perfect knowledge. One must give up materialistic association and make company with pure devotees of the Lord, those who are engaged twenty-four hours a day in perfectly pleasing the Supreme Lord. One should cultivate association with those who are more advanced than oneself in devotional service. One's advancement can be measured by one's detachment from sense gratification and his ability to distribute Kåñëa consciousness to others. In this connection Çréla Narottama däsa Öhäkura has said, chäòiyä vaiñëava-sevä, nistära päyeche kebä: "Who can attain salvation if he gives up the service of the Vaiñëavas?" By serving the lotus feet of pure devotees, one is immediately enlightened with spiritual knowledge. All of the so-called pleasures of the material world, culminating in many varieties of sexual fantasy and impersonal visions of oneself as God, become useless to one who has achieved the mercy of the lotus feet of a pure devotee of Kåñëa. The entire material creation is compared to an insignificant bubble in the ocean. The material universe rests on the spiritual potency of the Lord called brahmajyoti, just as an insignificant bubble rests on the potency of the unlimited ocean. By serving the lotus feet of a pure devotee one can enter the ocean of eternal happiness and experience his constitutional position as a servant of Kåñëa. The mercy of the Vaiñëavas is unlimited, and one who has tasted that mercy becomes mad after the lotus feet of Kåñëa, not caring for the hallucinations of so-called material pleasure or mental speculation. The mercy of the Vaiñëavas is substantial and as powerful as Kåñëa Himself, whereas impersonal speculations and hopeless dreams of society, friendship and love merely constitute various means by which mäyä cheats the conditioned souls and keeps them in perpetual frustration.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> To serve the spiritual master the disciple should learn cleanliness, austerity, tolerance, silence, study of Vedic knowledge, simplicity, celibacy, nonviolence, and equanimity in the face of material dualities such as heat and cold, happiness and distress.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çaucam, or "cleanliness," refers to both internal and external purity. One should remain externally clean by bathing with soap and water at least once and, if possible, three times daily. One is considered internally pure when he is free from the pollution of false pride and egotism. Tapaù, or "austerity," means that despite the irrational impulses of the mind one should remain fixed in executing his proper duty in life. Specifically, one must control burning anger and the urge for wanton sex life. If a human being does not control the impulses of lust, anger and greed, he loses his power to understand his actual situation. Human life is a golden opportunity to solve the overwhelming problems of birth, death, old age and disease. According to the Viñëu Puräëa</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">(3.8.9),</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">varëäçramäcära-vatä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">puruñeëa paraù pumän</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">viñëur ärädhyate panthä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nänyat tat-toña-käraëam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">[Cc. Madhya 8.58]</div>
<div class="First"> Every human being can achieve spiritual perfection by dedicating the fruits of his prescribed work to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu. Similarly, in Bhagavad-gétä (18.45) Lord Kåñëa clearly states, sve sve karmaëy abhirataù saàsiddhià labhate naraù. One does not have to adopt a monastic life or live in the forest as a yogé; one can achieve perfection by dedicating his occupational duties to the Supreme Lord. Similarly, Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura has said, nämäçraya kari' yatane tumi, thakaha äpana käje. If one sincerely takes shelter of the holy names of Kåñëa by chanting Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, he will achieve spiritual perfection within the compass of his normal daily activities. Unfortunately, if a human being neglects the regulative principles of civilized life that prohibit illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling, he will surely be overwhelmed by the waves of lust and anger, which completely cover one's consciousness of the reality of spiritual life and draw one to engage in the phantasmagoria of the temporary material body. As Lord Kåñëa has stated in</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">Bhagavad-gétä (3.39),</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ävåtaà jïänam etena</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">jïänino nitya-vairiëä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">käma-rüpeëa kaunteya</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">duñpüreëänalena ca</div>
<div class="First"> "Thus a man's pure consciousness is covered by his eternal enemy in the form of lust, which is never satisfied and which burns like fire." Therefore, the word tapaù, or "austerity," in this verse indicates that one must remain in his prescribed duty and not become impatient or unregulated due to the waves of lust, anger and greed.</div>
<div class="First"> The word titikñäm, or "tolerance," indicates that a transcendentalist must be forgiving. The material world is full of embarrassing and irritating situations, and unless one is inclined to be very much forgiving he will become infected by a vindictive mentality, which spoils one's spiritual consciousness. Maunam, or "silence," means that one should not speak on worthless or frivolous topics, but should discuss the actual issues of human life such as going back home, back to Godhead. Remaining completely silent is a symptom of ignorance; a stone is silent due to a lack of consciousness. Since every material thing has its spiritual counterpart, the Vedic çästras contain negative and positive injunctions. Corresponding to the negative injunction against speech is the positive injunction that one should always speak about Kåñëa. Satataà kértayanto mäm [Bg. 9.14]. One should always speak about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, glorifying His holy name, fame, pastimes, entourage, and so on. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam also it is stated, çrotavyaù kértitavyaç ca dhyeyaù püjyaç ca nityadä. One should always hear about, glorify, meditate upon and worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. In the twenty-first verse of this chapter it was stated, çäbde pare ca niñëätam. The bona fide spiritual master is expert in çäbde pare, or the transcendental sound vibration describing the spiritual world. One cannot artificially remain empty-headed or speechless, as advocated by foolish proponents of concocted systems of meditation and yoga. But one should be so absorbed in the loving service of Kåñëa, and so lovingly attracted to praising Kåñëa, that one has not a single moment free to speak nonsense. That is the purport of the word maunam.</div>
<div class="First"> Svädhyäyam means that one should study Vedic literature according to his individual ability and also teach others. In Bhagavad-gétä it is mentioned that a brähmaëa should have the qualities of jïäna and vijïäna, scriptural knowledge and practical realized application of knowledge. Specifically one should study those books which increase one's desire to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His Divine Grace Oà Viñëupäda Paramahaàsa Parivräjakäcärya Añöottara-çata Çré Çrémad Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda has written in a few short years a veritable library of transcendental knowledge. It is being practically seen throughout the world that when the principle of svädhyäyam, or Vedic study, is applied to these books, such as Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Bhagavad-gétä As It Is, Caitanya-caritämåta and The Nectar of Devotion, the sincere reader becomes infused with the ecstatic determination to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The entire International Society for Krishna Consciousness is expanding all over the world on the basis of this transcendental literature. Svädhyäyam does not indicate speculative or imaginary interpretations of religious scriptures, nor should one try to read many books to increase his false prestige as a so-called scholar. One should read those books which inspire practical spiritual advancement in knowledge and renunciation, as exemplified by the books of Çréla Prabhupäda. The word ärjavam indicates simplicity or straightforwardness. According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé svacchatäm, or "clarity, transparency," is a synonym for straightforwardness. Unless one is pure in consciousness he will adopt many crooked means. Straightforwardness does not indicate that one should insult others in the name of honesty, but that one should speak the humble truth. The word brahmacaryam, or "celibacy," indicates either renouncing completely the association of women or following strictly the Vedic principles of householder life, which regulate sex life for the purpose of procreating saintly children. Ahiàsäm indicates that one should not commit violence against any living entity. Unless one is aware of the subtle laws of karma, by which a living being enjoys and suffers, one cannot actually practice ahiàsä, or nonviolence. Ultimately the material world is full of violence, and the laws of nature, which impose old age, disease and death upon every living creature, are themselves filled with violence. Therefore, if somehow or other one can convince others to surrender to Kåñëa and thus release themselves from the violent laws of material nature, that is the perfection of ahiàsä.</div>
<div class="First"> Samatvaà dvandva-saàjïayoù indicates that one should keep a cool head even when disturbing material dualities become manifest. Kåñëa says in Bhagavad-gétä (2.14):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mäträ-sparçäs tu kaunteya</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> One should practice meditation by constantly seeing oneself to be an eternal cognizant spirit soul and seeing the Lord to be the absolute controller of everything. To increase one's meditation, one should live in a secluded place and give up false attachment to one's home and household paraphernalia. Giving up the decorations of the temporary material body, one should dress himself with scraps of cloth found in rejected places, or with the bark of trees. In this way one should learn to be satisfied in any material situation.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Kaivalyam, or living in a secluded place, indicates a place free from material disturbances. Therefore, one should live in the association of Vaiñëavas, where the common goal is advancement in Kåñëa consciousness. Especially in the Kali-yuga, if one tries to remain physically isolated from all others the result will be degradation or insanity. Aniketatäm means that one should not be intoxicated by the ephemeral satisfaction of one's "home sweet home," which will vanish at any moment by the unforeseen circumstances produced by one's previous activities. In this age it is not actually possible to dress in tree bark in modern cities, nor to wear mere scraps of cloth. Previously, human culture accommodated those practicing tapasya, or penances in the interest of spiritual advancement. In this age, however, the most urgent necessity is for preaching the message of Bhagavad-gétä throughout human society. Therefore, it is recommended that Vaiñëavas dress with clean and neat cloth, covering the body decently so that the conditioned souls will not be frightened or repulsed by the severe penances of the Vaiñëavas. In the Kali-yuga the conditioned souls are extremely attached to material sense gratification, and extreme austerities are not appreciated, but are instead considered abominable denials of the flesh. Of course, austerity is required for spiritual advancement, but the practical example set by Çréla Prabhupäda in successfully spreading the Kåñëa consciousness movement was that all material things should be used to attract people to Kåñëa consciousness. Therefore, Vaiñëavas may at times adopt ordinary dress to serve the higher principle of distributing Kåñëa consciousness. In any case, one should learn to be satisfied in any material situation so as to prepare for the moment of death. According to Bhagavad-gétä, at the time of death the particular consciousness we have created in this life will carry us to our future situation. Therefore, human life can be seen as a type of practice for successfully fixing one's mind on the Absolute Truth during the severe trials of death.</div>

<div class="Translation"> One should have firm faith that he will achieve all success in life by following those scriptures that describe the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagavän. At the same time, one should avoid blaspheming other scriptures. One should rigidly control his mind, speech and bodily activities, always speak the truth, and bring the mind and senses under full control.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The definition of çraddhä, or faith, is given as follows in Caitanya-caritämåta (Madhya 22.62):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">'çraddhä'-çabde-viçväsa kahe sudåòha niçcaya</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kåñëe bhakti kaile sarva-karma kåta haya</div>
<div class="First"> "By rendering transcendental loving service to Kåñëa, one automatically performs all subsidiary activities. This confident, firm faith, favorable to the discharge of devotional service, is called "çraddhä." Thus a devotee should be confident that by carrying out the injunctions of bhägavata-çästra, or Vedic literature that directly, rather than indirectly, describes devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one will easily achieve all knowledge and the perfection of life.</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura,</div>
<div class="First"> mano-väk-käya-daëòam, or strict control of the mind, speech and bodily activities, means mänasa-väcika-käyika-vikarma-rähityam; that is, one should rigidly abandon all sinful activities with his mind, speech and body. As Çréla Prabhupäda has repeatedly pointed out, sense control does not mean stopping sensory activities, thus becoming like a dead body, but rather engaging one's mental, vocal and bodily activities in the service of Kåñëa. Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">has stated,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">éhä yasya harer däsye</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">karmaëä manasä girä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nikhiläsv apy avasthäsu</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">jévan-muktaù sa ucyate</div>
<div class="First"> "A person acting in Kåñëa consciousness, in the service of Kåñëa, with his body, mind, intelligence and words is a liberated person, even within the material world, although he may be engaged in many so-called material activities." (Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 1.2.187) Thus one can achieve vikarma-rähityam, or freedom from unauthorized, sinful activities, by engaging one's senses, mind, intelligence and speech twenty-four hours daily in the service of Kåñëa. In Bhagavad-gétä Lord Kåñëa says that only those pious living entities who are vikarma-rahita, completely free from sinful life, can achieve freedom from the illusory duality of material nature (samatvaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">dvandva-saàjïayoù). The Lord says,</div>

<div class="First"> "Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful actions are completely eradicated and who are freed from the duality of delusion engage themselves in My service with determination." (Bg. 7.28) In his purport to this verse, His Divine Grace Çréla Prabhupäda has stated, "Those eligible for elevation to the transcendental position are mentioned in this verse. For those who are sinful, atheistic, foolish and deceitful, it is very difficult to transcend the duality of desire and hate. Only those who have passed their lives in practicing the regulative principles of religion, who have acted piously and have conquered sinful reactions can accept devotional service and gradually rise to the pure knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then, gradually, they can meditate in trance on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the process of being situated on the spiritual platform. This elevation is possible in Kåñëa consciousness in the association of pure devotees who can deliver one from delusion."</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted the following statement from the Brahmäëòa Puräëa: "One should have complete faith in transcendental literature such as Çrémad-Bhägavatam and other literature that directly glorifies the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should also have faith in Vaiñëava tantras, the original Vedas, and Mahäbhärata, which includes Bhagavad-gétä and which is considered the fifth Veda. The Vedic knowledge originally emanated from the breathing of Viñëu, and Vedic literature has been compiled in literary form by Çréla Vyäsadeva, the incarnation of Viñëu. Therefore, Lord Viñëu should be understood to be the personal speaker of all this Vedic literature. "There are other Vedic literatures, called kalä-vidyä, which give instructions in material arts and sciences. Since all such Vedic arts and sciences are ultimately intended to be used to render devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Keçava, saintly persons in the renounced order of life should never blaspheme such apparently mundane literatures; because such literatures are indirectly connected with the Supreme Lord, one may go to hell for blaspheming these secondary literatures. "Çraddhä indicates a faithful mentality, which can be analyzed in two sections. The first type of faith is a firm conviction that all the statements of the multifarious Vedic literatures are true. In other words, the understanding that Vedic knowledge in general is infallible is called çraddhä, or faith. A second type of faith is the belief that one must personally carry out a particular injunction of Vedic literature in order to achieve his goal in life. A devotee of the Supreme Lord should thus apply the first type of faith to the various kalä-vidyäs, or Vedic material arts and sciences, but he should not accept such scriptures as pointing out his personal goal in life. Nor should he carry out any Vedic injunction that is contradictory to the injunctions of Vaiñëava scriptures such as the Païcarätra.</div>
<div class="First"> "Thus one should faithfully accept all Vedic literature as directly or indirectly describing the Supreme Personality of Godhead and should not blaspheme any portion of it. Even for Lord Brahmä, as well as for other creatures, down to the insignificant unmoving species such as trees and stones, blasphemy of any Vedic literature causes one to merge into the darkness of ignorance. Thus the suras—the demigods, great sages and devotees of the Lord—should understand that the Païcarätric literatures, as well as the four Vedas, the original Rämäyaëa, the Çrémad-Bhägavatam and other Puräëas, and the Mahäbhärata, are Vedic literatures that establish the supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the unique transcendental position of the Lord's devotees according to their status of spiritual advancement. Any other vision of Vedic literatures is to be considered an illusion. In all authorized religious scriptures the ultimate goal is to understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the controller of everything and everyone, and that the Lord's devotees are not different from Him, although such devotees are to be understood in terms of their level of spiritual advancement." Lord Kåñëa has stated in Bhagavad-gétä, vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyo/ vedänta-kåd veda-vid eva cäham: "By all the Vedas, I am to be known; indeed, I am the compiler of Vedänta, and I am the knower of the Vedas." Similarly, the Lord states:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yasmät kñaram atéto 'ham</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">akñaräd api cottamaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ato 'smi loke vede ca</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">prathitaù puruñottamaù</div>
<div class="First"> "Because I am transcendental, beyond both the fallible and the infallible, and because I am the greatest, I am celebrated both in the world and in the Vedas as the Supreme Person." (Bg. 15.18)</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura mentions that one cannot develop the godly qualities mentioned in the preceding verses unless one accepts the shelter of the lotus feet of a bona fide Vaiñëava spiritual master. Tasmäd guruà prapadyeta jijïäsuù çreya uttamam [SB 11.3.21]. In this connection, he has quoted the following statement:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">arcayitvä tu govindaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tadéyän närcayet tu yaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na sa bhägavato jïeyaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kevalaà dämbhikaù småtaù</div>
<div class="First"> "One who performs worship of Lord Govinda but fails to worship His devotees should be understood to be not a devotee of the Lord but simply a victim of false pride." For one who has accepted shelter at the lotus feet of a pure devotee of Kåñëa, it is very easy to execute worship of the Lord Himself. For such a surrendered soul there is no need of artificial penances and austerities. In this regard Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has quoted the following (from Närada Païcarätra):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ärädhito yadi haris tapasä tataù kià</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">narädhito yadi haris tapasä tataù kim</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">antar bahir yadi haris tapasä tataù kià</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">näntar bahir yadi haris tapasä tataù kim</div>
<div class="First"> "If one is worshiping Lord Hari, what is the use of performing extraneous penances? And if one is not worshiping Lord Hari, no such penances will save one. If one can understand that Lord Hari is all-pervading, within and without, what is the need of performing penances? And if one is not able to understand that Hari is all-pervading, all his penances are useless." A Vaiñëava is always absorbed in executing his devotional service to Kåñëa. If a devotee becomes falsely proud of executing severe penances and austerities and meditates on accepting and rejecting material objects instead of thinking of his service to Kåñëa, his so-called austerities become an impediment to devotional service.</div>
<div class="First"> A devotee should not be disturbed by the word jugglery of those who are against the devotional service of the Lord. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has emphatically pointed out that devotional service to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord is the only means of achieving the final perfection of life. Therefore a Vaiñëava should practice maunam, or silence, by ignoring those literatures which are full of false arguments, such as those of the Mäyäväda school, and those karma-käëòa scriptures which promote sense gratification in the name of religious life. If one becomes overwhelmed by mundane unhappiness due to not achieving immediate success in self-realization, or if one becomes deluded by sense gratification and tries to take shelter of materialistic men and doctrines, one's devotional progress will immediately be checked. Similarly, if a devotee expresses love for things separate from Kåñëa or tries to find fault in the process of devotional service or the philosophy of Bhagavad-gétä in order to justify absorbing himself in the sense gratification of seeing things separate from Kåñëa, his progress in spiritual enlightenment will be seriously disturbed. Such an illusory concept is called dvitéyäbhiniveça, or absorption in illusion. On the other hand, if one is attracted to the vibration of Vedic sound by the consensus of self-realized authorities called the vaiñëava-paramparä and thus engages enthusiastically in kåñëa-näma-kértana, or chanting the holy names of the Lord, then one's practice of mauna, or silence, is perfect.</div>
<div class="First"> One should avoid prajalpa, or whimsical conversations unrelated to devotional service. Merely restraining the senses artificially without chanting and hearing the glories of the Supreme Lord cannot be considered the spiritual perfection. The example is given that although many domestic animals in the barnyard are sometimes forced to practice celibacy when isolated from one another, such animals cannot be considered brahmacärés, or spiritual students. Similarly, one is not considered spiritually advanced simply because of dry speculative arguments or temporary austerities. One must submissively hear the message of the Vedic sound vibration, especially as it is summarized in Bhagavad-gétä by the Lord Himself. Vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù [Bg. 15.15].</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has warned us that if one becomes attracted to nontheistic ethical philosophies, such as those of the Buddhists and Jains, which glorify such mundane principles as ahiàsä, or nonviolence, one's mundane faith in godless ethics is spiritually suicidal. To restrict the senses by artificial austerities and to undertake huge social arrangements to facilitate mass sense gratification are both godless attempts to regulate human society in an artificial way that hides the eternal relationship of every living being with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the natural leader of society. When so-called moral philosophers spoil the opportunity of human life, the opportunity to revive our eternal relationship with Kåñëa, in the name of ethics such foolish persons commit the greatest violence against human society. Therefore, Kåñëadäsa Kaviräja Gosvämé has said,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">çré-kåñëa-caitanya-dayä karaha vicära</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">vicära karile citte päbe camatkära</div>
<div class="First"> "If you are indeed interested in logic and argument, kindly apply them to the mercy of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. If you do so, you will find such mercy strikingly wonderful." (Cc. Ädi 8.15)</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura a mahä-bhägavata, or pure devotee of the Lord, is one who sees that both the material and spiritual worlds are nondifferent from Lord Kåñëa, being expansions of His potency, but also sees that Vrajendranandana, Kåñëa, keeps Himself eternally distinct by His unique quality of all-attractiveness. Thus a pure devotee of the Lord is aniketana, without a fixed residence, meaning that he accepts neither the gross nor subtle body as his eternal residence. Since one's so-called home and family are expansions of his body, such material creations are also not to be considered one's actual residence. Caitanya Mahäprabhu said,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ayi nanda-tanuja kiìkaraà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">patitaà mäm viñame bhavämbudhau</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kåpayä tava päda-paìkajasthita-</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">dhülé-sadåçaà vicintaya</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">[Cc. Antya 20.32, Çikñäñöaka 5]</div>
<div class="First"> "O Kåñëa, son of Mahäräja Nanda, I am Your eternal servitor, yet somehow or other I have fallen into the ocean of birth and death. Please pick me up from this ocean of death and place me as one of the atoms at Your lotus feet." (Çikñäñöaka 5) Thus a devotee should understand that his eternal residence is fixed in the dust of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A Vaiñëava should reject the gross sense gratification of living in the forest in the mode of goodness, in the city in the mode of passion, or in the gambling house in ignorance. A pure devotee may travel all over the world distributing Kåñëa consciousness, but he should never consider any material place to be his actual residence. One who has become mature in this understanding may take the tridaëòa-sannyäsa order of life under the direct shelter of the Lord. The impersonalist cannot understand how the devotee of the Lord, although fixed in the duality of seeing himself as eternally different from the Lord, sees all existence as nondifferent from the Lord. Those who attempt to acquire knowledge by impersonal speculation based on their tiny experience of the material cosmic manifestation cannot understand the transcendental reality of acintya-bhedäbheda-tattva(93), the Absolute Truth's simultaneous oneness with and difference from His creation. The process of assimilating this transcendental knowledge is given in these verses, starting with tasmäd guruà prapadyeta [SB 11.3.21]. One is recommended to accept a bona fide spiritual master and serve him according to the direction of these verses. The essence of such instructions is that one should abandon the association of Mäyävädé impersonalists, ritualistic fruitive workers and those who are whimsically indifferent to the ultimate purpose of life, and instead one should devote himself to associating with the devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A falsely proud neophyte may imagine himself a great devotee of the Lord without taking to the company of the Lord's followers, but without such association it is not possible to become advanced in Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="Translation"> One should hear, glorify and meditate upon the wonderful transcendental activities of the Lord. One should specifically become absorbed in the appearance, activities, qualities and holy names of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus inspired, one should perform all of one's daily activities as an offering to the Lord. One should perform sacrifice, charity and penance exclusively for the Lord's satisfaction. Similarly, one should chant only those mantras which glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And all one's religious activities should be performed as an offering to the Lord.

<div class="Verse-in-purp">In Bhagavad-gétä (9.27) Lord Kåñëa has ordered,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yat karoñi yad açnäsi</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yaj juhoñi dadäsi yat</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yat tapasyasi kaunteya</div>

<div class="First"> "O son of Kunté, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and give away, and all austerities that you perform should be done as an offering unto Me." Çréla Prabhupäda has commented on this verse as follows: "Thus, it is the duty of everyone to mold his life in such a way that he will not forget Kåñëa in any circumstance. Everyone has to work for maintenance of his body and soul together, and Kåñëa recommends herein that one should work for Him. Everyone has to eat something to live; therefore he should accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Kåñëa. Any civilized man has to perform some religious ritualistic ceremonies; therefore Kåñëa recommends, 'Do it for Me,' and this is called arcanam. Everyone has a tendency to give something in charity; Kåñëa says, 'Give it to Me,' and this means that all surplus money accumulated should be utilized in furthering the Kåñëa consciousness movement. Nowadays people are very much inclined to the meditational process, which is not practical in this age, but if anyone practices meditating on Kåñëa twenty-four hours by chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra round his beads, he is surely the greatest yogé, as substantiated by the Sixth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä."</div>
<div class="First"> Many persons who become attracted to the devotional service of Kåñëa are bewildered by the material possessions, reputation or skills they have accumulated by their previous material activities. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé these two verses indicate that all such material opulences accumulated by one's previous karma should be used as an offering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One's fame, education, wealth and so on should all be used to carry out the mission of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sometimes envious materialists ask why one should waste one's wealth and education in the Lord's service when such things could be better used to gratify the temporary material body. Actually, however, whatever we possess, including this body, is ultimately the property of the Supreme Lord, who is the creator, maintainer and annihilator of all existence. Therefore, one should be blessed by dovetailing one's so-called opulences in the devotional service of the Lord. Otherwise, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä, måtyuù sarva-haraç cäham: [Bg. 10.34] the Supreme Lord will appear before us at the time of death as måtyu, death personified, and violently take away all of our possessions. Therefore, such possessions should be peacefully offered to the lotus feet of the Lord while we are still living and able to enjoy the pious result of such an offering.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, tapaù, austerity, means that one should observe vows such as Ekädaçé-vrata, in which one fasts from grains and beans twice a month. The word japtam refers to chanting the holy names of the Lord, such as Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has further pointed out that one can offer one's wife, children and home to the Lord by converting one's family into devotees of the Supreme Lord. Rather than becoming artificially puffed up in the pursuit of so-called status symbols, one's family should be trained to understand that they are eternal servants of the Supreme Lord. And when the entire family becomes dedicated to the Lord's service, a very beautiful situation is created. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has pointed out that if a human being is not initiated into the process of bhägavata-dharma he must depend upon the uncertain knowledge derived from his gross material senses. Indifferent to the sublime descriptions of the Lord's eternal appearances, pastimes and innumerable transcendental qualities, the faithless materialist wanders about on the platform of mundane enjoyment. But if one can understand the reality of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is described in authorized Vedic literature, then one should accept the order of tridaëòa-sannyäsa, or at least one should practice restraint of the body, mind and words and thus become self-controlled and fixed in the Absolute Truth. Then all of one's desires, all the charity he gives, and his penances and chanting of mantras-in other words, his entire personality, his home, his children, his wife and his very life air—become heartfelt offerings to the Supreme Lord. When a living entity constantly hears the authorized descriptions of the Supreme Lord and dovetails all of his activities in the Lord's service, avoiding other activities, he is considered to be fixed on the platform of bhägavata-dharma.</div>

One should render service to both the Lord and His devotees, since the Lord is more pleased by sincere service rendered to His pure devotees. One should not only officially offer respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, His devotees and His worshipful paraphernalia, but should actually render service to the representatives of the Lord, who are known as mahä-bhägavatas.</div>

And by thus encouraging one another they are able to give up material sense gratification, which is the cause of all suffering.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, those who are advanced in Kåñëa consciousness should not envy one another or quarrel among themselves. Giving up all such mundane feelings, they should gather together and chant the glories of the Supreme Lord for mutual purification. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has pointed out that glorification of the Supreme Lord is especially potent when performed in the association of pure devotees. When devotees engage in saìkértana, chanting the glories of the Lord together, they experience the highest transcendental bliss and satisfaction. Thus they encourage one another to give up material sense gratification, which is based on illicit sexual connections with women. One devotee will say to another, "Oh, you have given up sense gratification. Starting today, I shall also give it up."</div>
<div class="First"> One should learn to increase one's love for the devotees, to satisfy them and to give up sense objects unfavorable to serving Kåñëa. And one should learn to view the entire universe as paraphernalia for the Lord's service. By engaging the objects of the senses in Kåñëa's service, one automatically becomes detached from them. And as one passes one's days in the association of the Lord's devotees, one's transcendental ecstasy increases more and more, through discussions about the topics of Çrémad-Bhägavatam and Bhagavad-gétä. Therefore, one who wants to be free from the harassment of mäyä in the form of sense gratification must constantly associate with pure devotees of the Lord who have no engagement other than chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord and carrying out His mission on earth.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Madhväcärya has pointed out that just as one should cultivate friendship with devotees, one must cultivate a spirit of friendship toward the demigods, who manage the universe on the Lord's behalf. Thus one should live peacefully within this world.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The devotees of the Lord constantly discuss the glories of the Personality of Godhead among themselves. Thus they constantly remember the Lord and remind one another of His qualities and pastimes. In this way, by their devotion to the principles of bhakti-yoga, the devotees please the Personality of Godhead, who takes away from them everything inauspicious. Being purified of all impediments, the devotees awaken to pure love of Godhead, and thus, even within this world, their spiritualized bodies exhibit symptoms of transcendental ecstasy, such as standing of the bodily hairs on end.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word aghaugha-haram is very significant in this verse. Agha refers to that which is inauspicious or sinful. The living entity is actually sac-cid-änanda-vigraha [Bs. 5.1], or eternal and full of bliss and knowledge, but by neglecting his eternal relationship with Kåñëa, the Personality of Godhead, he commits sinful activities and undergoes the inauspicious result in the form of material suffering. The chain of sinful reactions is called ogha, or a relentless wave of suffering. Kåñëa is aghaugha-haraà harim; He takes away the sinful reactions of His devotees, who are thus entitled to experience the inconceivable bliss of the kingdom of God even while remaining in this world. The words bhaktyä saïjätayä bhaktyä indicate that there are two divisions of bhakti-yoga: sädhana-bhakti and rägänuga-bhakti. Çréla Prabhupäda has elaborately explained in his book The Nectar of Devotion the progress of the devotee from sädhana-bhakti, or the execution of regulative principles, to rägänuga-bhakti, or service executed in love of Godhead. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, a liberated soul is always enthusiastic due to the appearance of transcendental ecstasy within his body. Thus he always aspires to remain overwhelmed in chanting the glories of the Personality of Godhead, Hari.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Having achieved love of Godhead, the devotees sometimes cry out loud, absorbed in thought of the infallible Lord. Sometimes they laugh, feel great pleasure, speak out loud to the Lord, dance or sing. Such devotees, having transcended material, conditioned life, sometimes imitate the unborn Supreme by acting out His pastimes. And sometimes, achieving His personal audience, they remain peaceful and silent.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has explained the symptoms of love of Godhead. Rudanti: The devotees cry, thinking, "Another day has passed, and still I could not obtain Kåñëa. Then what will I do, where will I go, from whom shall I inquire, and who can possibly help me reach Kåñëa?" Hasanti: It is late at night, the sky is dark, and Kåñëa is determined to steal from the house of one of the elderly gopés. He is hiding underneath a tree in the corner of the courtyard belonging to one of the cowherd men. Although Kåñëa thinks that He is completely concealed, He suddenly hears a voice from one of the elderly members of the family. "Who are You there? Who are You? I say." Thus Kåñëa has been caught, and He begins to flee the courtyard. When this humorous scene is revealed to the devotee, the devotee begins to laugh heartily. Nandanti: When Kåñëa actually reveals His transcendental form to the devotee, the devotee experiences the highest transcendental bliss. Vadanti: The devotee says to the Lord, "O Kåñëa, after so many days I have finally achieved You."</div>
<div class="First"> When all of the devotee's senses are absorbed in Çré Kåñëa, the devotee has successfully transcended the material condition of life. This is indicated by the word alaukikäù. Alaukikäù, or the transcendental platform, is explained by the Lord in Bhagavad-gétä (14.26):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mäm ca yo 'vyabhicäreëa</div>

<div class="First"> "One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman."</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, ajaà harim, anuçélayanti tal-léläm abhinayanti: "Anuçélayanti indicates that out of extreme ecstasy the devotees sometimes imitate or act out the pastimes of the Supreme Lord." This ecstatic symptom was manifested by the gopés in Våndävana during Kåñëa's absence. In the twenty-first verse of this chapter it was stated that one who has understood that there is no happiness either on earth or in material heaven must surrender at the lotus feet of a bona fide spiritual master. Tasmäd guruà prapadyeta jijïäsuù çreya uttamam [SB 11.3.21]. The following verses gave many detailed instructions regarding the activities of a bona fide disciple. Now this verse is describing the mature fruit of devotional service, namely, pure love of Godhead. Everyone has the opportunity to come to this platform of transcendental bliss by taking the dust of the lotus feet of Kåñëa's representative on his head. One should give up the mentality of envy and false prestige and humbly take shelter of the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The spiritual master is to be considered the incarnation of the Lord's mercy. There is absolutely no doubt that a sincere soul who serves a bona fide spiritual master will achieve the highest perfection of life (çreya uttamam). He will enjoy eternal bliss and knowledge in the personal abode of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Thus learning the science of devotional service and practically engaging in the devotional service of the Lord, the devotee comes to the stage of love of Godhead.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has pointed out that mukti, or liberation, which is described in this verse by the words mäyäm aïjas tarati dustaräm, is actually a by-product or secondary result of pure love of Godhead. In the second verse of Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is pointed out, dharmaù projjhita-kaitavo 'tra paramo nirmatsaräëäà satäà/ vedyaà västavam atra vastu çivadaà täpa-trayonmülanam [SB 1.1.2]. Çrémad-Bhägavatam teaches the science of devotional service, in which the ultimate goal is pure love of Godhead. According to the Vaiñëava äcäryas, mukti, or liberation, is a by-product of love of Godhead. Çivadaà täpa-trayonmülanam. One should not approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead for liberation, since one is automatically liberated by obeying the order of the Lord. Kåñëa's order is given at the end of Bhagavad-gétä: sarva-dharmän parityajya mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja [Bg. 18.66]. Every living being should give up his mundane conceptions of life and take full shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. If one carries out this order the Lord automatically provides liberation (mukti). Actual happiness comes from loving God without any tinge of mental speculation or fruitive desire.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, in the previous verse the sages informed the King, näräyaëa-paro mäyäm aïjas tarati dustaräm: simply by unalloyed devotion to Lord Näräyaëa, one can very easily cross over the ocean of material illusion. Therefore, in this verse the King is requesting specific information about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Näräyaëa. It is significant in this verse that the King refers to the Supreme Lord as Näräyaëa, Brahman and Paramätmä. Although King Nimi is already understood to be a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by his question he wants to clarify that the Personality of Godhead is the highest transcendental truth. In the Bhägavatam (1.2.11):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">vadanti tat tattva-vidas</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tattvaà yaj jïänam advayam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">brahmeti paramätmeti</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhagavän iti çabdyate</div>
<div class="First"> "Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this nondual substance Brahman, Paramätmä or Bhagavän." Therefore it is to be understood that the word näräyaëa in this verse refers to the Bhagavän feature of the Supreme Lord in the spiritual world.</div>
<div class="First"> Generally the speculative philosophers become attracted to the impersonal Brahman feature of the Absolute Truth, whereas the mystic yogés meditate upon the Paramätmä, the Supersoul within everyone's heart. On the other hand, those who have achieved mature transcendental knowledge surrender directly to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagavän, who is eternally situated in His own abode, called Vaikuëöha-dhäma. In Bhagavad-gétä Lord Kåñëa clearly says, brahmaëo hi pratiñöhäham: "I am the source of the impersonal Brahman." Similarly, it is described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam that the Supersoul, Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, is a secondary plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. King Nimi wants the sages to make clear that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the original feature of the Absolute Truth, and therefore he places his question before the next of the nine Yogendras, Pippaläyana.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura the word niñöhä can also be translated as "firm faith." In this sense, Nimi Mahäräja is inquiring about the process of developing perfect faith in the Supreme Lord (bhagavan-niñöhä).</div>

<div class="Translation"> Çré Pippaläyana said: The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of the creation, maintenance and destruction of this universe, yet He has no prior cause. He pervades the various states of wakefulness, dreaming and unconscious deep sleep and also exists beyond them. By entering the body of every living being as the Supersoul, He enlivens the body, senses, life airs and mental activities, and thus all the subtle and gross organs of the body begin their functions. My dear King, know that Personality of Godhead to be the Supreme.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In the previous verse King Nimi inquired about various aspects of the Absolute Truth, namely Näräyaëa, Brahman and Paramätmä. Now the sage Çré Pippaläyana explains these three features of the Absolute Truth in the same order in which the King mentioned them. Sthity-udbhava-pralaya-hetuù refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who expands Himself as the triple puruña incarnations-Mahä-Viñëu, Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu and Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu. As described in the Bhägavatam (1.3.1):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">jagåhe pauruñaà rüpaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhagavän mahad-ädibhiù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sambhütaà ñoòaça-kalam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ädau loka-sisåkñayä</div>
<div class="First"> "In the beginning of the creation, the Lord first expanded Himself in the universal form of the puruña incarnation and manifested all the ingredients for the material creation. And thus at first there was the creation of the sixteen principles of material action. This was for the purpose of creating the material universe." Thus the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Näräyaëa, is mentioned here as hetuù, or the supreme cause of the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the cosmic situation. Still, there is no cause of the Lord Himself; He is ahetuù. As expressed in the Brahma-saàhitä, anädir ädir govindaù sarva-käraëa-käraëam [Bs. 5.1]. The Supreme Lord is the cause of all causes, and being the eternal Absolute Truth, He has no cause of Himself. The word ahetuù has also been explained by Çréla Jéva Gosvämé to indicate that the Supreme Lord has His original form as Kåñëa in His own transcendental abode, called Kåñëaloka. Since Kåñëa is always engaged in His blissful pastimes in the company of His eternally liberated associates, He is aloof from the affairs of this world, which is created by His external potency, known as mäyä. Therefore it is stated, jagåhe pauruñaà rüpam. The Lord expands Himself as Näräyaëa and Viñëu to facilitate the gross illusion and gradual rectification of the conditioned souls. The Lord's aloofness from the material creation is also described in the Vedas: na tasya käryaà karaëaà ca vidyate. The Absolute Truth has nothing to do, since everything is done self-sufficiently by His multipotencies. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has pointed out that even though the Supreme Lord Kåñëa is ahetuù, or causeless and aloof from the cause of material creation, the Lord is also described in this verse as hetuù, or the ultimate cause of the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the material manifestation, because He expands Himself as Paramätmä, or the Supersoul, who acts as the prime mover of the cosmic manifestation. The word ahetuù may also be understood in another way. In Bhagavad-gétä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">(7.5) the Lord says,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">apareyam itas tv anyäà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">prakåtià viddhi me paräm</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">jéva-bhütäà mahä-bäho</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yayedaà dhäryate jagat</div>
<div class="First"> The conditioned living entities (jéva-bhüta) desire to engage in sense gratification with their material senses (manaù-ñañöhänéndriyäëi prakåti-sthäni karñati [Bg. 15.7]). Thus the creation of the material world becomes necessary. In fact, the material cosmic manifestation continues to exist because of the desires of the conditioned souls to exploit it (yayedaà dhäryate jagat [Bg. 7.5]). The government must create a prison to accommodate those citizens who are inclined to criminal activity. There is no need for any citizen to live in the obnoxious conditions of the prison, but because a certain portion of the population is inclined toward antisocial behavior, the prison becomes necessary. In a higher sense, the prisoners themselves can be considered the hetuù, or the cause, for the construction of the prison. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead expands His internal potency according to His own desire to increase the änanda, or transcendental bliss, of Himself and His pure devotees, but He manifests the material universe in response to the illicit desires of the conditioned souls to live a life of sense gratification in willful forgetfulness of Him. Therefore the conditioned living entities themselves can be considered the hetuù, or cause, of the material manifestation. The external potency of the Lord, mäyä, who is charged with the duty of material manifestation, is called chäyä, or the shadow of the Lord's internal potency. Såñöi-sthiti-pralaya-sädhana-çaktir eka/ chäyeva yasya bhuvanäni bibharti durgä [Bs. 5.44]. The Lord does not personally desire to manifest the shadow potency, called Durgä or mäyä. The blissful spiritual planets, eternally manifest, contain the best possible facilities for the living entities who are parts and parcels of the Lord. But the conditioned souls, rejecting the inconceivable, eternal living arrangements the Lord has kindly provided, prefer to seek their misfortune in the shadow kingdom called the material world. Thus, both Durgä and the conditioned living entities may be considered the hetuù, or cause, of the material manifestation. Since Lord Kåñëa is ultimately sarva-käraëa-käraëam [Bs. 5.1], the cause of all causes, He is to be known as the ultimate supreme cause. But how the Lord functions as the supreme cause of the material manifestation (sthity-udbhava-pralaya-hetuù) is described in the Thirteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä. Upadrañöänumantä ca: the Lord acts as overseer and permitter. The actual desire of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is stated very clearly in Bhagavad-gétä: sarva-dharmän parityajya mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja [Bg. 18.66]. The Lord desires every living entity to give up the shadow potency mäyä and return to the actual substance (västavaà vastu), which is the eternal kingdom of God.</div>
<div class="First"> Although various aspects of the Absolute Truth are being described, the Absolute Truth is ultimately one, as stated in this verse (tad avehi paraà narendra). King Nimi inquired about Brahman, and now this verse says, yat svapna-jägara-susuptiñu sad bahiç ca. The Lord's all-pervading feature within wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep, and His existence beyond these three mental states, are understood to be manifestations of Brahman, the spiritual potency of the Lord. Finally, the statement dehendriyäsu-hådayäëi caranti yena saïjévitäni can be understood to refer to the Paramätmä feature of the Lord. When the Lord expands Himself as Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, the third of the three Viñëu features, and enters the heart of every living entity, the gross and subtle organs of the body become enlivened for continuing the chain of fruitive activity called karma.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the multifarious manifestations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead do not compromise His supremacy as one without a second. The Absolute Truth is paramavyoma-nätha, or the Lord of the spiritual sky, who appears as two-armed Çyämasundara, as four-armed, as eight-armed or as having one thousand arms. In each aspect His body is eternal and full of bliss and knowledge (sac-cid-änanda-mürti). He appears on earth as Väsudeva and within the Causal Ocean as Mahä-Viñëu. He lies on the Milk Ocean as Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu and rescues His helpless young devotee as Nåsiàhadeva. Appearing as Lord Rämacandra, He acts. as a perfect king. And appearing as Kåñëa He steals the heart of everyone, and especially of young beautiful women. All these features of the Lord are indicated by the word Näräyaëa, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just as the word president indicates not only the official duties of the president but his personal family life and long intimate friendships as well. According to Çrémad-Bhägavatam, kåñëas tu bhagavän svayam [SB 1.3.28]. When one transcends an official understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and comes to the superior status of love of God, one can understand the Lord to be Kåñëa, the cause of all causes. The innumerable Viñëu expansions of the Lord are also understood to be plenary portions of Çré Kåñëa. Kåñëas tu bhagavän svayam. As the Lord Himself states in Bhagavad-gétä, ahaà sarvasya prabhavaù [Bg. 10.8]. These points have been explicitly clarified in the Tenth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam as well as in the opening verse, oà namo bhagavate väsudeväya, janmädy asya yato 'nvayäd itarataç cärtheñu [SB 1.1.1].</div>

<div class="Translation"> Neither the mind nor the faculties of speech, sight, intelligence, the life air or any of the senses are capable of penetrating that Supreme Truth, any more than small sparks can affect the original fire from which they are generated. Not even the authoritative language of the Vedas can perfectly describe the Supreme Truth, since the Vedas themselves disclaim the possibility that the Truth can be expressed by words. But through indirect reference the Vedic sound does serve as evidence of the Supreme Truth, since without the existence of that Supreme Truth the various restrictions found in the Vedas would have no ultimate purpose.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The small sparks generated by a blazing fire have no power to illuminate the original fire, nor can they burn it. The quantity of heat and light in the original fire is always superior to the quantity found in the insignificant sparks. Similarly, the minute living entity is generated from the internal potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as stated in Vedänta-sütra (janmädy asya yataù [SB 1.1.1]) and Bhagavad-gétä (ahaà sarvasya prabhavaù [Bg. 10.8], mamaiväàço jéva-loke jéva-bhütaù sanätanaù [Bg. 15.7]). The minute living entities, being aàçaù, or sparks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, can never equal the Supreme Godhead in the quantity of their potency. The quantity of knowledge and bliss in the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always superior. Therefore, when a foolish conditioned soul tries to illuminate the subject matter of the highest truth with his tiny brain, he merely illuminates his own foolishness. The Personality of Godhead has personally spoken Bhagavad-gétä, which is the blazing fire of perfect knowledge that burns to ashes the insignificant speculations and theories of so-called philosophers and scientists regarding the ultimate truth.</div>
<div class="First"> The Supreme Personality of Godhead is called Håñékeça, or the Lord of everyone's senses. Because the Personality of Godhead has supreme seeing power, hearing power, touching power, smelling power and tasting power, the living entities in a limited sense can also see, hear, touch, smell and taste, by the mercy of Håñékeça. This idea is expressed in the Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad (4.4.18): präëasya präëam uta cakñuñaç cakñur uta çrotrasya çrotram annasyännaà manaso ye mano viduù. "The Supreme Truth is understood to be the life air sustaining everyone's life air, the vision of everyone's eyes, the hearing power of the ear, and the sustenance of food itself." The obvious conclusion is that the Supreme Truth can be known by His own causeless mercy, and not by our foolish attempts to bring the all-pervading truth within the insignificant boundaries of our intelligence. It is stated in the Taittiréya Upaniñad (2.4.1), yato väco nivartante apräpya manasä saha: "The descriptive power of speech fails in the realm of the Supreme Truth, and the speculative power of the mind cannot achieve Him."</div>
<div class="First"> But because such statements of Vedic çrutis are in themselves descriptions of the Absolute Truth, one may consider such Vedic statements contradictory. Therefore, in this connection it is stated, çabdo 'pi bodhaka-niñedhatayätma-mülam arthoktam äha: although the Vedic çruti (çabda) forbids us to speculate upon the Absolute Truth, such restrictive injunctions indirectly constitute positive assertions of the existence of the supreme living entity. In fact, the Vedic restrictions are meant to save one from the false path of mental speculation and ultimately bring one to the point of devotional surrender. As Lord Kåñëa Himself states in Bhagavad-gétä, vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù: [Bg. 15.15] by all Vedic literatures the Supreme Personality of Godhead is to be known. The assertion that a particular process, such as mental speculation, is useless (yato väco nivartante apräpya manasä saha) constitutes an indirect assertion of the existence of a correct path of achieving the Supreme. As Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has stated, sarvasya niñedhasya sävadhitvät: "Every negative injunction is understood to have a specific limit. Negative injunctions cannot be taken as applicable in all cases." For example, a negative injunction is that no living entity can be equal to or greater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But Çrémad-Bhägavatam clearly states that because of the intense love of the residents of Våndävana for Kåñëa, they sometimes assume a superior position. Thus mother Yaçodä binds Kåñëa with ropes, and the influential cowherd boys sometimes ride on the shoulders of Kåñëa or defeat Him in wrestling. Negative injunctions, therefore, may sometimes be adjusted according to the transcendental situation. Although the Absolute Truth is transcendental to the material creation and therefore beyond the scope of material senses, when those same material senses are saturated with love of Godhead they become spiritualized and empowered to perceive the Absolute Truth. As stated in Brahma-saàhitä</div>

<div class="First"> "But you cannot see Me with your present eyes. Therefore I give you divine eyes by which you can behold My mystic opulence." Similarly, Çrémad-Bhägavatam describes many incidents in which the Supreme Absolute Truth revealed Himself to His devotee, as in the histories of Prahläda Mahäräja, Dhruva Mahäräja, Påthu Mahäräja, Kardama Muni, the Päëòavas and the gopés. Therefore, the Vedic assertions that the Absolute Truth is beyond the power of the eyes refer to those who have not received transcendental eyes by the mercy of the Personality of Godhead. But the Lord's own transcendental senses, which are the source of our limited senses, are confirmed in the çruti, as in the following statement from the Kena Upaniñad (1.4): yad väcänabhyuditaà yena väg abhyudyate/ tad eva brahma tvaà viddhi nedaà yad idam upäsate. "Brahman, the Absolute, should be understood to be that which cannot be ascertained by the material power of speech; speech itself is evinced by that Supreme Truth." By the statement yena väg abhyudyate, "our power of speech is expressed by the Absolute Truth," it is clearly expressed that the Absolute Truth has His own transcendental senses. Therefore He is called Håñékeça.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Närada Muni has stated, håñékena håñékeça-sevanaà bhaktir ucyate [Cc. Madhya 19.170]. Our senses cannot approach the Absolute Truth by their own power, but when engaged in loving devotional service to satisfy the Lord of the senses, our limited senses must become connected with the Lord's unlimited senses, and thus by the Lord's mercy He can be understood. Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted the following statement from the Brahma-tarka:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">änando nedåçänanda</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ity ukte lokataù param</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">pratibhäti na cäbhäti</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yathävad darçanaà vinä</div>
<div class="First"> "The transcendental bliss of the Absolute Truth cannot be compared to the ordinary happiness of the material world." Similarly, in the Vedänta-sütra the Absolute Truth is described as änandamaya, or full of bliss. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, in this verse Çré Pippaläyana is more or less describing the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth. The nine Yogendras were themselves devotees of the personal feature of the Lord, so King Nimi asked his question about the different features of the Absolute Truth to clarify that the Personality of Godhead is the source of all the variegated aspects of the advaya-jïäna, or transcendental reality. This is also expressed by the following statement in çruti: taà tv aupaniñadaà puruñaà påcchämi. "I am inquiring about that Supreme Person revealed in the Upaniñads."</div>
<div class="First"> If the Absolute Truth were actually inaccessible by words, there would be no meaning to the Vedic literature, which consists of collections of transcendental words. Since the Vedic descriptions of the truth are to be taken as infallible, it is impossible to maintain that the power of speech is in all cases unable to describe the truth. After all, the Vedic mantras themselves are meant to be spoken and heard. Therefore, the injunction that neither the mind nor speech can approach the Absolute Truth (naitan mano viçati väg uta) cannot be taken as applicable in all cases; rather, it is a warning to those who foolishly try to encompass the Absolute Truth by their own puny speculative powers. Since the Vedic injunctions, either positive or negative, are to be taken as realistic descriptions of the Absolute Truth, the process of hearing and repeating Vedic knowledge (çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù [SB 7.5.23]) can be understood as a separate process in which one's hearing and speaking power becomes spiritualized by submissive reception of transcendental knowledge. This process depends upon one's faith in the bona fide spiritual master, who is a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore it is stated,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yasya deve parä bhaktir</div>

<div class="First"> "Only unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master are all the imports of Vedic knowledge automatically revealed." (Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad 6.23) As the Lord Himself states in the</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">mamaiva tad ghanaà tejo</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">jïätum arhasi bhärata</div>
<div class="First"> "That Supreme Truth, Parabrahman, expands itself into all the variegatedness of this universe. You should know it to be My own concentrated effulgence, O Bhärata." The words jïätum arhasi, "you must know it," spoken by the Lord Himself, indicate that the Absolute Truth is to be known, but one must surrender to the truth, rather than waste time in foolish speculation. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has pointed out that according to authorized statements of Vedic literature the Lord's transcendental form is understood to be brahmamaya, or completely spiritual, with no trace of material contamination. Therefore, in such statements as nélotpala-dala-çyämam, "the Lord's form is beautifully manifest with the hue of dark blue lotus petals," it is understood that a transcendental dark blue color is being described. Still, the Lord is inconceivably merciful to His devotees, even those on the neophyte platform who are trying to come to the state of love of Godhead. Therefore the Lord gradually purifies the senses of a conditioned soul who is trying to understand Him, and eventually the Lord appears before such a rectified servitor. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, präkåta-nélotpala-varëatvena bhaktair dhyätam atädåçam api. In the beginning, being conditioned by previous materialistic activities, a devotee meditating on the Lord's transcendental form may base his meditation on his experience of material forms and colors within this world. The Lord's transcendental form has nothing to do with material forms and colors, but since the object of this meditation is Kåñëa, such meditation will eventually be transformed into transcendental experience of the actual form, color, activities, pastimes and entourage of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, transcendental knowledge depends not on material logic but on the pleasure of the Personality of Godhead. If the Lord is pleased by His devotee's sincere attempt to understand Him, the Lord can immediately circumvent all the so-called technicalities of material logic and Vedic injunctions and reveal Himself to His pure devotee. Unless one accepts this omnipotency of the Personality of Godhead, there is no hope of approaching the Absolute Truth. Therefore it is stated in the Kaöha Upaniñad (1.3.12), dåçyate tv agryayä buddhyä: the Absolute Truth is seen by transcendental intelligence. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has pointed out that knowledge acquired through the interaction of the material senses with the modes of nature is merely hypothetical and not factual. Empirical knowledge deals with our ephemeral experience of the sense objects generated by material nature. For example, there are many wars currently going on because of a false concept of nationalism. Similarly, there is conflict throughout the world, and great world leaders fight like cats and dogs for the economic development of their countries. Thus, material language is used to designate temporary objects perceived by the eyes, nose, tongue, touch and taste. This type of language and experience is useless for approaching the Absolute Truth. But the transcendental sound from the spiritual sky has a completely different effect. We should not foolishly try to use materially concocted language to include the Supreme Personality of Godhead as an object of the material world. The Supreme Lord is completely transcendental and is known as ätma-prakäça, or self-manifested. Therefore, as stated in the Padma Puräëa,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ataù çré-kåñëa-nämädi</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na bhaved grähyam indriyaiù</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">svayam eva sphuraty adaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">[Cc. Madhya 17.136]</div>
<div class="First"> "Material senses cannot appreciate Kåñëa's holy name, form, qualities and pastimes. But when a conditioned soul is awakened to Kåñëa consciousness and renders service by using his tongue to chant the Lord's holy name and taste the remnants of the Lord's food, the tongue is purified, and one gradually comes to understand who Kåñëa really is." If one surrenders to the Supreme Lord, taking shelter at His lotus feet, one's spiritualized senses gradually become empowered to perceive the Lord. Mere empiricism and material logic have a limited jurisdiction within the external energy of the Supreme Lord and cannot apply to those things which are eternal. In this regard, Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has quoted the following verse from Çrémad-Bhägavatam (7.5.32):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">naiñäà matis tävad urukramäìghrià</div>

<div class="First"> "Unless they smear upon their bodies the dust of the lotus feet of a Vaiñëava completely freed from material contamination, persons very much inclined toward materialistic life cannot be attached to the lotus feet of the Lord, who is glorified for His uncommon activities. Only by becoming Kåñëa conscious and taking shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord in this way can one be freed from material contamination."</div>
<div class="First"> Although Çré Pippaläyana is expressing that the Absolute Truth cannot be approached by material senses, the sage himself is describing the Absolute Truth with transcendental senses, and King Nimi is able to understand this transcendental sound because he has surrendered at the lotus feet of pure devotees, the nava-yogendras. Therefore, one should not foolishly try to understand this verse out of context, in an impersonal way, but should follow the example of King Nimi, who was trying to understand how the Supreme Personality of Godhead is ultimately the source of everything.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Originally one, the Absolute, Brahman, comes to be known as threefold, manifesting itself as the three modes of material nature—goodness, passion and ignorance. Brahman further expands its potency, and thus the power to act and the power of consciousness become manifest, along with the false ego, which covers the identity of the conditioned living being. Thus, by the expansion of the multipotencies of the Absolute, the demigods, as the embodiment of knowledge, become manifest, along with the material senses, their objects, and the results of material activity, namely happiness and distress. In this way the manifestation of the material world takes place as the subtle cause and as the material effect visible in the appearance of gross material objects. Brahman, which is the source of all subtle and gross manifestations, is simultaneously transcendental to them, being absolute.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In the previous verse the sage Pippaläyana described the Absolute, Brahman, as being beyond the range of material sense perception and mental speculation. At the same time, it was stated, ätma-mülam arthoktam äha yad-åte na niñedha-siddhiù: the negative injunctions of the Vedas indirectly indicate the existence of the Absolute Truth. This Absolute Truth can be approached by correct means. Now, in the present verse, it is clearly described that the Absolute Truth possesses innumerable potencies (uru-çakti brahmaiva bhäti). Thus by the expansion of the Absolute Truth the gross and subtle features of the material world become manifest. As stated by Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, käryaà käraëäd bhinnaà na bhavati: "The result is not different from its cause." Therefore, since the Absolute is eternal existence, this material world, being the potency of the Absolute, must also be accepted as real, although the various manifestations of the material world are temporary and thus illusory. The material world should be understood to consist of the bewildering interactions of real elements. The material world is not false in the imaginary sense of the Buddhists and Mäyävädés, who state that in fact the material world does not exist outside the mind of the observer. The material world, as the potency of the Absolute, has real existence. But the living entity becomes bewildered by the temporary manifestations, foolishly taking them to be permanent. Thus the material world functions as an illusory potency, causing the living entity to forget the spiritual world, wherein life is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge. Because the material world thus bewilders the conditioned soul, it is called illusory. When a magician performs his tricks onstage, that which the audience apparently sees is an illusion. But the magician actually exists, and the hat and rabbit exist, although the appearance of a rabbit coming out of a hat is an illusion. Similarly, when the living entity identifies himself as part and parcel of the material world, thinking, "I am American," "I am Indian," "I am Russian," "I am black," "I am white," he is bewildered by the magic of the Lord's illusory potency. The conditioned soul must come to understand, "I am a pure spirit soul, part and parcel of Kåñëa. Now let me stop my useless activities and serve Kåñëa, since I am part of Him." Then he is free from the illusion of mäyä. If one artificially tries to escape the clutches of the illusory energy by declaring that there is no illusory potency and that this world is false, he merely falls into another illusion created by mäyä to keep him in ignorance. Kåñëa states in Bhagavad-gétä (7.14),</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">daivé hy eñä guëamayé</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mama mäyä duratyayä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mäm eva ye prapadyante</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mäyäm etäà taranti te</div>
<div class="First"> Unless one surrenders at the lotus feet of Mäyeça, the Lord of the illusory potency, there is no possibility of escaping from illusion. Childishly declaring that there is no illusory potency is useless, since mäyä is duratyayä, or insurpassable for the tiny living entity. But Lord Kåñëa, the omnipotent Personality of Godhead, can immediately call off the illusory potency. In this verse the expansion of the material world from Brahman, the Absolute, is described. Since Brahman is one of the subordinate features of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (brahmeti paramätmeti bhagavän iti çabdyate [SB 1.2.11]), one who understands this material world to be Brahman is freed from the tendency to exploit the material energy through sense gratification and mental speculation aimed at one's own satisfaction. The question may be raised, Since Brahman is stated to be ekam, or one, how does it become manifest in the innumerable varieties of the material world? Therefore this verse uses the word uru-çakti. The Absolute contains multipotencies, as stated in the Vedas (Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad): parasya çaktir vividhaiva çrüyate [Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]. The Absolute Truth is not çakti, or energy, but çaktimän, the possessor of innumerable potencies. According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, one should submissively hear these authorized descriptions of the Absolute Truth. As stated in the previous verse, yathänalam arciñaù sväù: the insignificant sparks of a fire have no power to illuminate the blazing fire, which is itself the source of illumination. Similarly, the tiny living entity, who is like a spark of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, cannot illuminate the Personality of Godhead by his insignificant intellectual power. One may argue that the sun expands its potency in the form of its rays and it is through the illumination of those rays that we are able to see the sun. In the same way, we should be able to perceive the Absolute Truth by the expansion of its potency. In answer to this it may be stated that if the sun creates a cloud covering the sky, then despite the presence of sun rays the sun cannot be seen. Therefore, ultimately the power to see the sun depends not only on the sun's rays but on the presence of a clear sky, which is also an arrangement by the sun. Similarly, as stated in this verse, one can understand the existence of the Absolute Truth by the expansion of its potencies.</div>
<div class="First"> Although in the previous verse the power of the material senses and mind was rejected, the authorized descriptions given here inform us that one can directly perceive everything that exists to be the potency of the Personality of Godhead. In this regard, Närada Muni advised King Präcénabarhi as follows:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">atas tad apavädärthaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhaja sarvätmanä harim</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">paçyaàs tad-ätmakaà viçvaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sthity-utpatty-apyayä yataù</div>
<div class="First"> "You should always know that this cosmic manifestation is created, maintained and annihilated by the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Consequently, everything within this cosmic manifestation is under the control of the Lord. To be enlightened by this perfect knowledge, one should always engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord." (SB 4.29.79) As stated here, bhaja sarvätmanä harim: one must worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead so that one's consciousness will become clean and pure, just like the clear blue sky in which the potent sun is fully manifest. When one sees the sun, he immediately sees the sun's rays in full potency. Similarly, if one engages in the devotional service of Kåñëa, one's mind becomes cleansed of material dirt, and thus he can see not only the Lord but the Lord's expansions as the spiritual world, as the pure devotees, as the Paramätmä, as the impersonal Brahman effulgence and as the subsequent creation of the material world, the shadow of the kingdom of God (chäyeva), in which so many material varieties become manifest.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the word phalam can also be understood to mean puruñärtha-svarüpam, or the actual form of the goal of life, or, in other words, the transcendental form of the Lord Himself. The living entity in his original pure state is not different from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, the infinite multicolored opulence of the kingdom of God, called Vaikuëöha, is nondifferent in quality from the Lord. Thus when the Supreme Personality of Godhead is personally present with His unparalleled opulence and His pure spiritual servitors, the living entities, a very happy situation is created. The mundane concept of family is a perverted reflection of the happy situation created when the Lord is united in full spiritual opulence with His pure devotees. Every living entity has the option to join the Lord in His opulent eternal kingdom. Thus one should understand from this verse that everything within the gross and subtle cosmic manifestations is the potency of the Lord and is therefore meant to be used in the Lord's service. Éçäväsyam idaà sarvam [Éço mantra 1].</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has given an elaborate explanation proving that the entire cosmic situation is the natural potency of the Absolute Truth. Sometimes superstitious people, without knowledge of the Personality of Godhead, say that material activities are controlled by an independent devil and that God is struggling with such a devil. Such gross ignorance of the omnipotent status of the Personality of Godhead can be removed by understanding the purport of this verse. Just as a spark is a tiny emanation from a blazing fire, everything that exists is but an insignificant spark of the potency of the Personality of Godhead. The Lord therefore says in</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">Bhagavad-gétä (10.42),</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">athavä bahunaitena</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kià jïätena tavärjuna</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">viñöabhyäham idaà kåtsnam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ekäàçena sthito jagat</div>
<div class="First"> "But what need is there, Arjuna, for all this detailed knowledge? With a single fragment of Myself I pervade and support this entire universe." The omnipotent Personality of Godhead is actually the well-wishing friend of every living entity (suhådaà sarva-bhütänäm [Bg. 5.29]). Therefore, if one becomes sane and understands that one's well-wishing friend Kåñëa is the ultimate source and controller of everything that exists, one attains immediate peace (jïätvä mäà çäntim åcchati). Fear and illusion arise when one foolishly thinks that even one atom of the creation is not the controlled potency of the Personality of Godhead. Bhayaà dvitéyäbhiniveçataù syät. Denying the existence of the material world also creates a very dangerous situation of illusion. Both types of atheism—namely, seeing the material world as belonging to oneself (and therefore being meant for one's sense gratification) and declaring the nonexistence of the material world—are futile attempts to avoid one's eternal subordination to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the actual owner and enjoyer of everything. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has quoted the following question stated by Çré Maitreya to Çré Paräçara in the Viñëu Puräëa (1.3.1):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nirguëasyäprameyasya</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">çuddhasyäpy amalätmanaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kathaà sargädi-kartåtvaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">brahmaëo 'bhyupagamyate</div>
<div class="First"> "How are we to understand that Brahman, the Supreme Soul, is the executor of the creation, maintenance and destruction of the material world, even though it is devoid of qualities, immeasurable, unembodied and free from any fault?" In reply, Çré Paräçara stated:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">çaktayaù sarva-bhävänäm</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">acintya-jïäna-gocaräù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yato 'to brahmaëas täs tu</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sargädyä bhäva-çaktayaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhavanti tapatäà çreñöha</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">pävakasya yathoñëatä</div>
<div class="First"> "Mere logic cannot explain how even material objects expand their potency. These things can be understood by mature observation. The Absolute Truth expands His potency in the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the material world just as fire expands its potency of heat." (Viñëu Puräëa 1.3.2) Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains that one can understand the power of a valuable gem not by logical statements but by observing the effect of the gem. Similarly, one can understand the potency of a mantra by observing its power to achieve a particular effect. Such potency doesn't depend on so-called logic. There is no logical necessity for a seed's growing into a tree and giving fruits that nourish the human body. One may argue that the genetic code for the entire tree is contained within the seed. But there is no logical necessity for the existence of the seed, nor for the seed's expanding itself into a gigantic tree. Ex post facto, or after the manifestation of the wonderful material nature, the foolish material scientist traces out the expansion of a seed's potency in an apparently logical sequence of events. But there is nothing within the realm of so-called pure logic that dictates that a seed should expand into a tree. Rather, such expansion should be understood to be the potency of the tree. Similarly, the potency of a jewel is its mystic power, and various mantras also contain innate potencies. Ultimately the mahä-mantra—Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare—has the potency to transfer one to the spiritual world of bliss and knowledge. In the same way, the Absolute Truth has the natural quality of expanding itself into innumerable varieties of material and spiritual worlds. We may logically describe this expansion after the fact, but we cannot deny the expansion of the Absolute Truth. The conditioned soul who purifies his consciousness through the process of devotional service can scientifically observe the expansion of the Absolute Truth as described here, just as one who is not blind can observe the expansion of a seed into a huge tee. One can understand the potency of a seed not by speculation but rather by practical observation. Similarly, one must purify his vision so that he can practically observe the expansion of the Absolute Truth. Such observation can take place either by the ears or by the eyes. Vedic knowledge is çabda-brahma, or transcendental potency in the form of sound vibration. Therefore, one can observe the functions of the Absolute Truth through submissive hearing of transcendental sound. Çästra-cakñus. When one's consciousness becomes fully purified one can perceive the Absolute Truth with all of one's spiritualized senses. The Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, is devoid of material qualities such as mundane goodness, passion and ignorance because He is an ocean of transcendental qualities and therefore has no need for the inferior qualities of the material world. As stated in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad (4.10), mäyäà tu prakåtià vidyän mäyinaà tu maheçvaram: "Understand that mäyä is the material energy whereas the Supreme Lord is the Supreme Lord of mäyä."Similarly, it is stated in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, mäyäà ca tad-apäçrayäm: mäyä is always under the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="First"> Just as it is understood from the above discussion that the material world is an emanation from the impersonal Brahman potency of the Lord, Brahman itself is an expansion of the potency of Kåñëa, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä (brahmaëo hi pratiñöhäham).</div>

<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has pointed out that in the impersonal Brahman there is neither transcendental activity nor the supreme pum-artha, or benefit of human life, namely prema, love of Godhead. Therefore, if one is prematurely dazzled by the expansion of the Lord's bodily effulgence, known as Brahman, and therefore does not actually come to know the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no possibility of actually understanding one's eternal identity as an eternal blissful expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

<div class="Translation"> Brahman, the eternal soul, was never born and will never die, nor does it grow or decay. That spiritual soul is actually the knower of the youth, middle age and death of the material body. Thus the soul can be understood to be pure consciousness, existing everywhere at all times and never being destroyed. Just as the life air within the body, although one, becomes manifest as many in contact with the various material senses, the one soul appears to assume various material designations in contact with the material body.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The Vedic aphorism sarvaà khalv idaà brahma, "Everything is Brahman," has been explained in this chapter of the Bhägavatam. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the original source of everything. By expanding His internal potency, He manifests the spiritual world, and by expanding His external potency He manifests the material cosmos. The conditioned living entity is originally part and parcel of the superior, internal potency of the Lord, but being in contact with illusion, he falls under the clutches of the external potency. In any case, since everything is an expansion of the potency of the Supreme Brahman, everything is part and parcel of the Lord's spiritual potency. Bhayaà dvitéyäbhiniveçataù syäd éçäd apetasya viparyayo 'småtiù. When a living entity thinks that the material world is not part and parcel of the Lord's potency but is a separate existence, liable to be controlled and enjoyed by the tiny jéva soul, he is under viparyayaù, or a wrong conception. Asmåtiù. Thus the living entity forgets that the Supreme Lord is the proprietor of everything, everything being an expansion of the Lord. Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has pointed out that although the Lord's external potency is subject to transformations such as birth, growth, decay and death, one should not foolishly conclude that the Lord's internal potency, the living entity, is also subject to these changes. Both the living entity and material nature are ultimately Brahman, being expansions of the Supreme Brahman. But the Vedas clearly say, paräsya çaktir vividhaiva çrüyate: [Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport] the Lord's potencies are vividhä, or multifarious. Thus, according to this verse, nätmä jajäna na mariñyati naidhate 'sau na kñéyate: the soul is never born, nor does he die, and he certainly cannot grow or decay like a material body. Although the visible material body passes through boyhood, adolescence and old age, or although one may take birth as a demigod, human being, plant or animal, the spirit soul never changes his eternal constitutional position. Rather, he falsely identifies with the external transformations of the material body and thus imposes upon himself a psychological condition called illusion. This miserable illusory experience of seeing oneself transformed and ultimately annihilated by the laws of nature can be nullified by transcendental knowledge of one's eternal status as the superior energy of the Lord. The word sarvatra in this verse should not be foolishly misinterpreted to mean that the individual jéva soul is all-pervading. The soul is not born, nor does he die. Yet in our present conditioned state we falsely identify with the birth and death of the body. Therefore, because an all-pervading soul would never fall into illusion, sarvatra cannot indicate that the individual soul is all-pervading. Illusion implies an incomplete understanding of reality, which would not be possible for an all-pervading entity. Therefore, the word sarvatra is understood to mean that the pure spiritual soul exists in all material conditions. In deep sleep, for example, consciousness may not overtly be manifest, and yet the spirit soul is understood to be present within the body. Similarly, it is understood from Bhagavad-gétä that the spirit soul (nityaù sarva-gataù) may exist even within fire, water or outer space, since the existence of the soul never depends upon material conditions but is an eternal fact. The consciousness of the soul is more or less manifest according to the possibilities offered by a particular material situation, just as electric light is manifest in a particular intensity and color according to the bulb available. The electrical energy is one, but it is manifested variously according to material conditions.</div>
<div class="First"> The argument may be raised that although the spirit soul is pure consciousness (upalabdhi-mätram), it is our practical experience that consciousness is constantly transformed. If I am thinking of a blue object such as the sky, then my previous thought of a yellow object such as a flower is destroyed. Similarly, if I become aware that I am hungry, then my consciousness of the blue sky is destroyed. In this way, consciousness is constantly being transformed. Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has replied that consciousness itself is eternal, but in contact with the material senses it may be manifest in various ways. The example of the life air is very appropriate. Präëa, or the life air, is one, but in contact with the different senses it is manifest as the power to see, the power to hear, and so on. Similarly, consciousness, being spiritual, is ultimately one, but when in contact with the various senses it may be perceived in terms of particular sensory functions. But the state of consciousness is an eternal fact that cannot be changed, although it may be temporarily covered by mäyä.</div>
<div class="First"> When one becomes Kåñëa conscious, he is understood to be dhéra (dhéras tatra na muhyati [Bg. 2.13]). At that time one is no longer subject to bewilderment by falsely identifying his consciousness with the transformations of material nature.</div>
<div class="First"> From the statement tat tvam asi, found in the Chändogya Upaniñad, it is to be understood that spiritual knowledge is not impersonal but entails gradually perceiving the pure spiritual soul within the material body. Just as in Bhagavad-gétä Kåñëa repeatedly says aham, or "I," this Vedic aphorism uses the word tvam, or "you," to indicate that just as the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the individual spark of Brahman (tat) is also an eternal personality (tvam). Therefore, according to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé it is to be understood that the individual spark of Brahman is eternally conscious. Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has further pointed out that instead of wasting time trying to understand the truth in its impersonal aspect, which is merely the negation of temporary material variety, one should try to understand oneself to be an eternally conscious entity in the jéva category. In other words, one should understand oneself to be eternally a conscious servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="First"> In this regard Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted the following statement from the Mokña-dharma section of the Mahäbhärata:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ahaà hi jéva-saàjïo vai</div>

But you should not artificially think, 'Now I have seen the soul.' Rather, I, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, will bestow this benediction upon you when you are actually qualified."</div>

<div class="Translation"> The spirit soul is born in many different species of life within the material world. Some species are born from eggs, others from embryos, others from the seeds of plants and trees, and others from perspiration. But in all species of life the präëa, or vital air, remains unchanging and follows the spirit soul from one body to another. Similarly, the spirit soul is eternally the same despite its material condition of life. We have practical experience of this. When we are absorbed in deep sleep without dreaming, the material senses become inactive, and even the mind and false ego are merged into a dormant condition. But although the senses, mind and false ego are inactive, one remembers upon waking that he, the soul, was peacefully sleeping.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> When a living entity is awake the material senses and mind are constantly active. Similarly, when one is sleeping the false ego recollects one's waking experiences, and thus one experiences dreams or fragments of dreams while sleeping. But in the state of prasupti, or deep sleep, both the mind and the senses become inactive, and the false ego does not recall previous experiences or desires. The subtle mind and false ego are called liìga-çaréra, or the subtle material body. This linga-çaréra is experienced in the form of temporary material designations such as "I am a rich man," "I am a strong man," "I am black," "I am white," "I am American," "I am Chinese." The sum total of one's illusory conceptions of oneself is called ahaìkära, or false ego. And due to this illusory conception of life the living entity transmigrates from one species of life to another, as clearly explained in Bhagavad-gétä. The spirit soul, however, does not change its constitutional position of eternity, knowledge and bliss, although the soul may temporarily forget this position. To cite an analogous situation, if one dreams at night that he is walking in the forest, such a dream does not change one's actual position of lying in bed within his apartment. Thus it is stated in this verse, küöa-stha äçayam åte: despite the transformations of the subtle body, the spirit soul does not change. Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has given the following example to illustrate this point. Etävantaà kälaà sukham aham asväpsam, na kiïcid avediñam. One often thinks, "I was sleeping very peacefully, although I was not dreaming or aware of anything." It can be logically understood that one cannot remember something of which he has had no experience. Therefore, since one remembers peacefully sleeping although there was no mental or sensual experience, such a memory should be understood to be a vague experience of the spirit soul. Çréla Madhväcärya has explained that the demigods, who are a superior race of humanlike entities on the higher planetary systems of this universe, do not actually undergo the gross ignorance of deep sleep as do ordinary human beings. Because the demigods have superior intelligence, they are not merged into ignorance at the time of sleeping. In Bhagavad-gétä Lord Kåñëa says, mattaù småtir jïänam apohanaà ca [Bg. 15.15]. Sleep is apohanam, or forgetfulness. Sometimes by dreaming there is småti, or memory of one's actual condition, although in a dream one may experience one's family or friends in an altered, illusory state. But all such conditions of remembering and forgetting are due to the presence of the Supersoul within the heart. By the mercy of the Supersoul one can have a preliminary glimpse of the soul by remembering how one was peacefully resting even without mental or sensual experience.</div>
<div class="First"> According to the authorized commentaries on this verse, aviniçciteñu means sveda-jeñu, or born from perspiration. Çréla Madhväcärya has pointed out, bhü-svedena hi präyo jäyante: the earth's dew is to be considered the perspiration of the earth, and various species of life are generated from dew. In the Muëòaka Upaniñad (3.1.9) the situation of the soul in relation to präëa is explained:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">eño 'ëur ätmä cetasä veditavyo</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yasmin präëaù païcadhä saàviveça</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">yasmin viçuddhe vibhavaty eña ätmä</div>
<div class="First"> "The soul is atomic in size and can be perceived by perfect intelligence. This atomic soul is floating in the five kinds of air [präëa, apäna, vyäna, samäna and udäna]. The soul is situated within the heart, and it spreads its influence all over the body of the embodied living entities. When the soul is purified from the contamination of the five kinds of material air, its spiritual influence is exhibited." Thus in the innumerable species of life the spiritual soul remains situated within präëa, or the material life air.</div>

<div class="Translation"> When one seriously engages in the devotional service of the Personality of Godhead, fixing the Lord's lotus feet within one's heart as the only goal of life, one can destroy the innumerable impure desires lodged within the heart as a result of one's previous fruitive work within the three modes of material nature. When the heart is thus purified one can directly perceive both the Supreme Lord and one's self as transcendental entities. Thus one becomes perfect in spiritual understanding through direct experience, just as one can directly experience the sunshine through normal, healthy vision.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In the previous verse it was explained that one can have a preliminary glimpse of the eternal, unchanging soul by remembering one's experience of peacefully sleeping even while the mind and senses were totally inactive. One may ask, If in deep sleep there is a preliminary experience of the soul, why upon waking does one return to illusory material existence? It may be answered that because of material desires lodged within the heart the conditioned soul is addicted to the nescience of material sense gratification. A prisoner may glimpse through the bars the free light outside the prison window but still remain captive behind the bars. Similarly, although a conditioned soul may have a glimpse of the spirit soul, he remains captured within the bondage of material desires. Therefore, although one may have a preliminary understanding of the eternal soul that exists within the temporary body, or even of the Supersoul that accompanies the individual soul within the heart, a specific process is still required to eliminate the cause of material existence, namely material desire.</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">As explained in Bhagavad-gétä (8.6),</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yaà yaà väpi smaran bhävaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tyajaty ante kalevaram</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">taà tam evaiti kaunteya</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sadä tad-bhäva-bhävitaù</div>
<div class="First"> "Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain without fail." According to one's desire at the time of death a suitable material body is awarded by material nature. Karmaëä daiva-netreëa jantur dehopapattaye [SB 3.31.1]. According to one's fruitive desires and actions and under the jurisdiction of the representatives of the Lord called demigods, the living entity is awarded a particular material body, which is inevitably subject to harassment by birth, death, old age and disease. If one can eliminate the cause of a particular phenomenon, logically he also eliminates the effect. Therefore, this verse states that one should desire only to achieve shelter at the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead. One should give up illusory desires for material society, friendship and love, since such desires cause further material bondage. One should fix his mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, so that without fail one can remember Kåñëa at the time of</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">death. As the Lord states,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">anta-käle ca mäm eva</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">smaran muktvä kalevaram</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yaù prayäti sa mad-bhävaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yäti nästy atra saàçayaù</div>
<div class="First"> "Whoever, at the time of death, quits his body remembering Me alone, at once attains My nature. Of this there is no doubt." (Bg. 8.5) The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is the actual shelter for every living being. And the Lord can be directly perceived as soon as one's heart has become transparently clean through bhakti-yoga.</div>
<div class="First"> Bhagavad-gétä describes the state of achieving the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the words tato mäà tattvato jïätvä viçate tad-anantaram, and sometimes impersonalists falsely interpret these words to be a description of brahma-säyujyam, or impersonal merging into the existence of the Lord. It is clearly mentioned in this verse that one must fix his mind and devotion on the lotus feet of abja-näbha, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If the individual living entity were equal to the Personality of Godhead, the living entity could simply think of himself in order to be purified. But even then a contradiction would arise: the Personality of Godhead has no need to be purified, since He is described in Bhagavad-gétä as pavitraà paramam, or the supreme pure. Therefore, one should not artificially try to twist an impersonal meaning out of the statements of the Vedic literature. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has stated that the perfect stage of devotional service indicated in this verse can be observed in the activities of such great devotees as Dhruva Mahäräja. Dhruva Mahäräja approached the Personality of Godhead desiring a political adjustment on the material platform, but when purified by chanting the holy name of God (oà namo bhagavate väsudeväya) he felt no further need for material sense gratification. As stated in the First Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, janayaty äçu vairägyam. As soon as one advances in devotional service, one is freed from the embarrassment of superficial material desires.</div>
<div class="First"> The words upalabhyata ätma-tattvam are significant in this verse. Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura says that ätma-tattvam, or knowledge of the soul, indicates knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead along with His various expansions such as the impersonal brahmajyoti and the marginal living entity himself. As indicated here by the word säkñät, perceiving the Personality of Godhead means seeing the personal form of the Lord, His hands and legs, His various transcendental vehicles and servants, and so on, just as by devotion to the sun-god one can gradually perceive the personal body of the sun-god, along with his chariot and personal attendants. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has pointed out that in verses 35 through 39 the various stages of standard logic are demonstrated. Verse 35 establishes the viñaya, or general thesis. Verse 36 manifests saàçaya, or an expression of doubt. Verse 37 gives the pürva-pakña, or opposing argument. And verse 38 definitely establishes the siddhänta, or conclusion. Verse 39 presents saìgati, the summary. The saìgati, or final word, is that one should become a pure devotee of the Personality of Godhead and worship the Lord's lotus feet. Thus by cleansing the mirror of the heart one can see the Lord, just as a normal human being with healthy 20/20 vision can very easily see the brilliant rays of the sun or as an advanced devotee of the sun-god himself can see the personal body of the sun-god.</div>

<div class="First"> "All men are forced to act helplessly according to the impulses born of the modes of material nature; therefore no one can refrain from doing something, not even for a moment." Since the living entity cannot remain inactive, he must learn to dedicate his activities to the Lord. Çréla Prabhupäda comments on this verse from Bhagavad-gétä as follows: "It is not a question of embodied life, but it is the nature of the soul to be always active. Without the presence of the spirit soul, the material body cannot move. The body is only a dead vehicle to be worked by the spirit soul, which is always active and cannot stop even for a moment. As such, the spirit soul has to be engaged in the good work of Kåñëa consciousness, otherwise it will be engaged in occupations dictated by illusory energy. In contact with material energy, the spirit soul acquires material modes, and to purify the soul from such affinities it is necessary to engage in the prescribed duties enjoined in the çästras. But if the soul is engaged in his natural function of Kåñëa consciousness, whatever he is able to do is good for him."</div>
<div class="First"> Ordinary people often question the busy activities of the devotees of the Kåñëa consciousness movement, mistaking such activities to be ordinary material work. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has stated in this connection, kämya-karmäëy eva tyäjitäni, na tu nitya-naimittikäni, phalasyaiva vininditatvät. One should give up selfish activities performed for one's personal sense gratification, since the result of such thoughtless work is further material bondage. But one should offer one's regular or occasional occupational duties to the Supreme Lord, and thus such activities become transcendental devotional service. By the words tasmäd guruà prapadyeta jijïäsuù çreya uttamam [SB 11.3.21], this chapter has clearly explained that dovetailing one's work with the service of the Lord is an art one should learn at the lotus feet of the bona fide spiritual master. Otherwise, if one whimsically declares his materialistic work to be transcendental devotional service, there will be no actual result. Therefore, according to Çré Jéva Gosvämé, one should not mistake the word naiñkarmyam to indicate inactivity; rather, it indicates transcendental activity under the guidance of the Lord and His representative.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Çré Ävirhotra replied: Prescribed duties, nonperformance of such duties, and forbidden activities are topics one can properly understand through authorized study of the Vedic literature. This difficult subject matter can never be understood by mundane speculation. The authorized Vedic literature is the sound incarnation of the Personality of Godhead Himself, and thus Vedic knowledge is perfect. Even the greatest learned scholars are bewildered in their attempts to understand the science of action if they neglect the authority of Vedic knowledge.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Prescribed duties authorized by revealed scripture are called karma, whereas the failure to execute one's highest duty is called akarma. The performance of forbidden activities is called vikarma. Thus karma, akarma and vikarma are established by the authorized explanations of Vedic literature. They cannot be ascertained merely through mundane exercises in logic. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (6.16.51) the Lord says, çabda-brahma paraà brahma mamobhe çäçvaté tanü: "I am the form of the transcendental vibrations of the Vedas, such as oàkära and Hare Kåñëa Hare Räma, and I am the Supreme Absolute Truth. These two forms of Mine—namely, the transcendental Vedic sound and the eternally blissful spiritual form of the Deity—are My eternal forms; they are not material. " Similarly, it is stated in the Bhägavatam (6.1.40), vedo näräyaëaù säkñät svayambhür iti çuçruma: "The Vedas are directly the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Näräyaëa, and are self-born. This we have heard from Yamaräja." In the Puruña-sükta (Åg Veda, maëòala 10, sükta 90, mantra 9) it is stated, tasmäd yajïät sarva-huta åcaù sämäni jajïjire/ chandäàsi jajïjire tasmät: "From Him, Yajïa, came all sacrificial offerings, hymns of invocation and songs of praise. All the mantras of the Vedas come from the Lord." All the incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are completely transcendental and free from the four defects of conditional life, namely mistakes, illusion, cheating and imperfect senses. So Vedic knowledge, being a plenary manifestation of the Supreme Lord, is similarly infallible and transcendental.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has pointed out that in the material world, which is controlled by the illusory energy of the Lord, a particular sound vibration is discarded after describing its object. But on the spiritual platform called Vaikuëöha nothing is ever lost, and thus çabda-brahma, or the Personality of Godhead in His form as transcendental sound, is eternal.</div>
<div class="First"> In ordinary human discourse one can ascertain the meaning of human words by understanding the intention of the speaker. But since Vedic knowledge is apauruñeya, or transcendental, one can appreciate its purport only by hearing from the standard authorities in the chain of disciplic succession. This process is prescribed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gétä (evaà paramparä-präptam [Bg. 4.2]). Thus, even highly learned scholars who proudly neglect this simple descending process are certainly bewildered and embarrassed in their hopeless attempt to ascertain the ultimate meaning of Vedic knowledge. The four sons of Lord Brahmä declined to answer the question of King Nimi since at that time the King was a mere child and therefore not capable of seriously surrendering to the process of hearing through disciplic succession. Çréla Madhväcärya has pointed out in this regard, éçvarätmatväd éçvara-viñayatvät. Because the Vedas describe the unlimited Personality of Godhead, Vedic knowledge cannot be approached by mundane methods of comprehension.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Childish and foolish people are attached to materialistic, fruitive activities, although the actual goal of life is to become free from such activities. Therefore, the Vedic injunctions indirectly lead one to the path of ultimate liberation by first prescribing fruitive religious activities, just as a father promises his child candy so that the child will take his medicine.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, traiguëya-viñayä vedä nistraiguëyo bhavärjuna. The Vedas apparently offer fruitive results within the three modes of material nature. Those who perform ritualistic ceremonies or austerities in the mode of goodness are offered the chance for promotion to the higher planetary systems called Svargaloka. Açnanti divyän divi deva-bhogän. Similarly, those who perform karma-käëòa, or fruitive religious activities in the mode of passion, are allowed to become great rulers or wealthy men on earth and enjoy great prestige and earthly power. But as stated in the Manu-saàhitä, pravåttir eñä bhütänäà nivåttis tu mahä-phalä: "Although fruitive religious activities are very much popular among the conditioned souls, the actual perfection of life is achieved when one gives up all fruitive endeavor."</div>
<div class="First"> If a father tells his child, "You must take this medicine by my order," the child may become fearful and rebellious and reject the medicine. Therefore, the father entices his child by saying, "I am going to give you a delicious piece of candy. But if you want this candy, first just take this little bit of medicine, and then you can have the candy." Such indirect persuasion is called parokña-vädaù, or an indirect description that conceals the actual purpose. The father presents his proposal to the child as if the ultimate goal were to receive the candy and only a minor condition must be fulfilled to receive it. Actually, however, the father's goal is to administer the medicine to the child and cure him of his disease. Thus, describing the primary purpose indirectly and concealing it with a secondary proposal is called parokña-vädaù, or indirect persuasion.</div>
<div class="First"> Since the great majority of conditioned souls are addicted to sense gratification (pravåttir eñä bhütänäm), the Vedic karma-käëòa rituals offer them a chance to become free from temporary materialistic sense gratification by making them greedy for fruitive Vedic results such as promotion to heaven or a powerful ruling position on earth. In all Vedic rituals Viñëu is worshiped, and thus one is gradually promoted to the understanding that one's actual self-interest is to surrender to Viñëu. Na te viduù svärtha-gatià hi viñëum [SB 7.5.31]. Such an indirect method is prescribed for bälänäm, those who are childish or foolish. An intelligent person can immediately understand by direct analysis the actual purpose of Vedic literature as described by the Lord Himself (vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù [Bg. 15.15]). All Vedic knowledge ultimately aims at achieving shelter at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Without such shelter one must rotate within the 8,400,000 species offered by the illusory energy of the Lord. Ordinary material vision, either through gross sense perception or the subtle perception of rational induction, always yields imperfect knowledge distorted by the desire for illusory material enjoyment. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura comments that the cultivation of impersonal self-realization is also a disturbance to the conditioned souls, since the impersonal speculative process is an artificial attempt to become completely formless. Such an attempt is not at all in accord with the proper judgment of the Vedas, which is described in Bhagavad-gétä (vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù [Bg. 15.15]). In Lord Caitanya's movement there is no need to childishly pursue fruitive material results and gradually be dragged to actual knowledge. According to Caitanya Mahäprabhu:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">harer näma harer näma</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">kalau nästy eva nästy eva</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nästy eva gatir anyathä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">[Cc. Ädi 17.21]</div>
<div class="First"> In Kali-yuga life is very short (präyeëälpäyuñaù), and people are generally undisciplined (mandäù), misguided (sumanda-matayaù), and overwhelmed by the unfavorable results of their previous activities (manda-bhägyäù). Thus their minds are never peaceful (upadrutäù), and their very brief life span vitiates the possibility of their gradually progressing through the path of Vedic ritualistic activities. Therefore, the only hope is to chant the holy names of the Lord, harer näma [Cc. Ädi 17.21], In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (12.3.51) it is stated:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kaler doña-nidhe räjann</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">mukta-saìgaù paraà vrajet</div>
<div class="First"> Kali-yuga is an ocean of hypocrisy and pollution. In Kali-yuga all natural elements are polluted, such as water, earth, sky, mind, intelligence and ego. The only auspicious aspect of this fallen age is the process of chanting the holy names of the Lord (asti hy eko mahän guëaù). Simply by the delightful process of kåñëa-kértana one is freed from his connection to this fallen age (mukta-saìga) and goes back home, back to Godhead (paraà vrajet). Sometimes the preachers of the Kåñëa consciousness movement also use the parokña, or indirect method of persuasion, offering a nice transcendental sweet to the conditioned soul to entice him to come to the lotus feet of the Lord. Caitanya Mahäprabhu's movement is kevala änanda-käëòa, simply blissful. But by the mercy of Caitanya Mahäprabhu even one who is indirectly attracted to the Kåñëa consciousness movement achieves very quickly the perfection of life and goes back home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation"> If an ignorant person who has not conquered the material senses does not adhere to the Vedic injunctions, certainly he will engage in sinful and irreligious activities. Thus his reward will be repeated birth and death.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In the previous verse it was stated that although fruitive activities are prescribed in the Vedas, the actual goal of human life is to free oneself from all materialistic activities. Therefore, one may conclude that there is no need to perform the Vedic rituals, which offer regulated sense gratification. But an ignorant person, or, in other words, one who has not understood that he is not the material body but an eternal spiritual soul, part and parcel of Kåñëa, will invariably be unable to control the urges of the material senses. Therefore, if such a materially inclined person neglects the Vedic injunctions that administer regulated sense gratification, he will surely fall down into unregulated sense gratification in päpa, or sinful life. For example, those who are affected by sexual desire are ordered to accept the viväha-yajïa, or religious marriage ceremony. We often see that because of false pride a so-called brahmacäré, or celibate student of Vedic knowledge, rejects the marriage ceremony as mäyä, or material illusion. But if such a celibate student is unable to control his senses he will undoubtedly degrade himself by eventually engaging in illicit sex, which has no connection to Vedic culture. Similarly, a neophyte in Kåñëa consciousness is encouraged to eat kåñëa-prasädam to his full satisfaction. Sometimes an immature practitioner of bhakti-yoga tries to make a show of severe eating habits and eventually falls down into eating unregulated and abominable foodstuffs.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the words måtyor måtyum upaiti mean that a sinful person is awarded a free ticket to hell by the lord of death himself, Yamaräja. This is also described in the Vedas as follows: måtvä punar måtyum äpadyate ardyamänaù sva-karmabhiù. "Persons who cause themselves severe pain by their materialistic activities gain no relief at the moment of death, for they are placed again in a situation in which death will occur." Therefore, Vedic ritualistic activities such as the wedding ceremony or the relishing of sumptuous yajïa-çiñöa, or food remnants of sacrifice, should not be given up by those whose senses are not yet controlled. The previous verse gave the example of a father's administering candy to his son to induce the child to take medicine. If the child rejects the father's offer, thinking that the candy is unnecessary, the child also misses the opportunity to take the medicine that will cure him. Similarly, if a materialistic person rejects the Vedic injunctions that administer prescribed sense gratification, he will not be purified but instead will be further degraded. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has described a materialistic person as one whose mind and intelligence are not faithfully fixed in the message of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-gétä Çré Bhagavän, Lord Kåñëa, gives wonderful explanations to the conditioned souls, represented by Arjuna, concerning the actual goal of life. One who cannot fix his mind on these instructions is to be considered a materialistic person who is inclined toward sinful activities and who must therefore submit himself to the standard Vedic injunctions. Such Vedic injunctions, even though fruitive. are considered puëya, or pious, according to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, and thus one who strictly performs them will not go to hell. Lord Kåñëa Himself states in the Bhägavatam (11.20.9),</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tävat karmäëi kurvéta</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na nirvidyeta yävatä</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">çraddhä yävan na jäyate</div>
<div class="First"> "One should continue to perform the Vedic ritualistic activities until one actually becomes detached from material sense gratification and develops faith for hearing and chanting about Me."</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains that the Vedas prescribe that one rise early in the morning, bathe, and chant the Gäyatré mantra. If one artificially gives up such a disciplined, regulated life, one will gradually become a victim of activities for gross sense gratification, such as eating in restaurants and indulging in illicit connections with women. Thus losing control of his senses, he becomes just like an animal, engaging from the early morning until the night in dangerous activities. Çréla Madhväcärya has commented in this regard, ajïaù sann äcarann api. Although in ignorance, one continues to act, not considering the future result of one's activities. Such indifference to the future result of one's activities is described in Bhagavad-gétä to be a symptom of the mode of ignorance. Just as an intelligent man will not drive his car on a highway if he knows the highway will lead him to danger, an intelligent man will not perform non-Vedic activities if he knows that the ultimate result will be the disaster described here by the words måtyor måtyum upaiti. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has stated that ignorant persons sometimes think that after death one automatically attains everlasting peace. But by the powerful reactions of one's sinful activities one comes to a most unpeaceful condition, for one must suffer hellish miseries in exchange for the meager temporary fruits of material work. Such hellish reactions occur not once but perpetually, as long as one is indifferent to the Vedic injunctions.</div>

<div class="First"> Human life is an opportunity offered by the laws of nature to the conditioned soul so that he may understand his eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Unfortunately, even in the human form of life most living entities remain addicted to improving the standard of animal activities, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating. Almost no one is interested in the actual success of life, Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="First"> "Those persons who are materially engrossed, being blind to the knowledge of ultimate truth, have many subject matters for hearing in human society, O Emperor." (SB 2.1.2)</div>
<div class="First"> It is stated, parama-käruëiko vedaù—"Vedic knowledge is supremely merciful"—because it engages the animalistic human beings in a gradual process of purification that culminates in full consciousness of Lord Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gétä (vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù [Bg. 15.15]). The majority of human beings are not able to suddenly give up material sense gratification, even though they understand from Vedic literature that such sense gratification causes a pernicious future effect. We have practical experience in the Western countries that when the government informed the citizens that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer, most people were unable to give up their smoking habit. Therefore, the Vedic literature prescribes a gradual process of purification in which the conditioned soul learns to offer the results of his material activities to the Supreme Lord, thus spiritualizing those activities. Material sense gratification is based on two organs, namely the tongue for tasting and the genitals for sex life. By offering palatable food to the Deity of Kåñëa and then enjoying the remnants as kåñëa-prasädam and by accepting the rules and regulations for Vedic householder life and begetting of Kåñëa conscious children, one can gradually bring the full range of material activities to the platform of pure devotional service. By offering the fruits of one's ordinary activities to the Supreme Lord, one gradually understands that the Lord Himself, and not material sense gratification, is the actual goal of life. Lord Kåñëa warns in Bhagavad-gétä that if people are prematurely encouraged to give up householder life or the sumptuous remnants of the Lord's prasädam, such artificial renunciation will have the opposite effect. There is a class of duplicitous men who misunderstand the transcendental purpose of the Vedas and falsely claim that material fruitive results such as promotion to heaven, which is offered in the agniñöoma sacrifice, constitute the ultimate goal of the Vedas. Such foolish men have been described by Lord Kåñëa:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yäm imäà puñpitäà väcaà</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">kriyä-viçeña-bahuläà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhogaiçvarya-gatià prati</div>
<div class="First"> "Men of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of the Vedas, which recommend various fruitive activities for elevation to heavenly planets, resultant good birth, power, and so forth. Being desirous of sense gratification and opulent life, they say that there is nothing more than this." (Bg. 2.42-43) To refute such a foolish understanding of the Vedic purpose, this verse uses the word niùsaìgaù, which means "without attachment to material results." The actual purpose of the Vedas is arpitam éçvare, to offer everything to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The result is siddhim, or the perfection of life, Kåñëa consciousness.</div>
<div class="First"> The words rocanärthä phala-çrutiù clearly indicate that the fruitive results promised in the Vedic literature are meant to stimulate a materialistic person to have faith in the Vedic injunctions. The example is given that a child may be offered candy-covered medicine. The child becomes enthusiastic to take the medicine because of the candy coating, whereas a mature person will be enthusiastic to take the medicine itself, knowing that such medicine is meant for his real self-interest. The mature platform of Vedic understanding is mentioned in the Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad (4.4.22): tam etaà vedänuvacanena brähmaëä vividiñanti brahmacaryeëa tapasä çraddhayä yajïenänäçakena ca. "By the teaching of the Vedas and by celibacy, penances, faith and controlled eating, great brähmaëas come to know the Supreme." The Supreme is Kåñëa, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä. Although the prescribed rituals of the Vedas may sometimes resemble material fruitive work, the activity is spiritualized because the result is offered to the Supreme. Candy-covered medicine and ordinary candy may appear or taste the same. But the candy-covered medicine has a therapeutic effect not found in ordinary candy. Similarly, the words naiñkarmyaà labhate siddhim in this verse indicate that a faithful follower of the Vedic injunctions will gradually be promoted to the highest perfection of life, pure love of Godhead, as stated by Caitanya Mahäprabhu (premä pum-artho mahän).</div>

<div class="Translation"> One who desires to quickly cut the knot of false ego, which binds the spirit soul, should worship the Supreme Lord, Keçava, by the regulations found in Vedic literatures such as the tantras.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The Vedic literatures contain mysterious descriptions of the Absolute Truth that stimulate philosophical speculation. The Vedas also offer heavenly rewards for the performance of ritualistic ceremonies. But as stated in verse 44 of this chapter such jïäna-käëòa and karma-käëòa sections of the Vedas are bälänäm anuçäsanam; that is, because less intelligent or childish persons are addicted to mental speculation and fruitive activity, these sections of the Vedas are meant to attract such persons to take shelter of the Vedic injunctions for gradual promotion to the perfect stage of Kåñëa consciousness. Now that the path for those who are materialistic has been described in several verses, this verse describes the process for those who are vijïaù, or learned transcendentalists. Such learned transcendentalists are advised to follow the regulated worship described in such Vaiñëava tantras as Çré Närada-païcarätra for pleasing the Supreme Lord directly. The words upacared devaà tantroktena ca keçavam indicate that one should directly worship Keçava, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who appears in many different incarnations to please His devotees. Çréla Jayadeva Gosvämé has described the pastimes of the Lord in his song describing ten prominent incarnations of the Personality of Godhead, Keçava: Lord Fish, Lord Tortoise, Lord Boar, Lord Nåsiàhadeva, Lord Vämana, Lord Paraçuräma, Lord Rämacandra, Lord Balaräma, Lord Buddha and Lord Kalki. The words upacared devam indicate devotional service to the Personality of Godhead. And therefore the word tantroktena, or "injunctions of the tantras," should be understood to indicate vaiñëava-tantras such as Çré Närada-païcarätra, which give explicit and detailed instructions for worshiping Keçava. The Vedas are referred to by the term nigama. And the elaborate explanation of these nigamas is called ägama, or tantra. When the transcendental living entity becomes perturbed by the obnoxious harassment of material bodily dualities, he becomes eager to hear from the Vedas about his transcendental situation. The word äçu in this verse indicates that those who are eager to put a quick end to material existence and situate themselves in the eternal blissful life of perfect knowledge should directly worship Lord Kåñëa, bypassing the preliminary Vedic rituals described in the previous verses.</div>

The bona fide disciple should always remember that his entire understanding of Vedic knowledge is coming through the mercy of his bona fide spiritual master. If one superficially or whimsically accepts and rejects a bona fide Vaiñëava spiritual master, sometimes becoming attracted to another spiritual master, one commits a vaiñëava-aparädha, a great offense against the devotees of the Lord. Sometimes a foolish neophyte mistakenly thinks that the relationship with the spiritual master is meant for the sense gratification of the disciple, and therefore in the name of spiritual aspirations such a fool gives up a bona fide Vaiñëava guru. One should understand oneself to be the eternal servant of the guru. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, however, has quoted this verse from the Närada-païcarätra:</div>

Therefore he should again be initiated properly, according to the prescribed method, by a Vaiñëava guru."It is the duty of the bona fide spiritual master to examine carefully the qualification of the disciple, and the disciple should similarly approach a bona fide spiritual master. Otherwise, the foolish disciple and the indiscriminate guru may both be punished by the laws of nature. One should not artificially try to assimilate all of the apparently conflicting branches of Vedic knowledge. Vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù [Bg. 15.15]. Conditioned souls have various conflicting natures, which are engaged by apparently conflicting Vedic injunctions called pravåtti and nivåtti-märga. But the easiest path is simply to learn the process of regularly worshiping advaya-jïäna, Lord Viñëu. All the demigods mentioned in the Vedas are paraphernalia for the service of the Supreme Lord, Viñëu. Whatever exists in the visible material world is also meant to be engaged in the Lord's service; otherwise, it has no value. If one artificially renounces material things useful in the service of the Supreme Lord, he loses his spiritual qualification of seeing everything as meant for Kåñëa's pleasure and will be forced to think of material objects as meant for his own sense enjoyment. In other words, material things should be accepted or rejected according to the pleasure of the Supreme Lord. Otherwise, one will fall down from the standard of pure devotional service. As stated in this verse, labdhvänugraha äcäryät: such discrimination can be learned when one receives the mercy of a bona fide spiritual master, who reveals to the sincere disciple the practical application of Vedic knowledge.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Präëäyäma is the authorized Vedic process for controlling the air within the body. Similarly, bhüta-çuddhi is a process for purifying the body. The word çuciù means that one should be internally and externally clean. Çuciù means that one should perform activities only for the pleasure of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If somehow or other one can remember the Supreme Lord constantly by chanting and hearing His holy name, one will come to the pure stage of life, as described in this Vedic mantra:</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">(Garuòa Puräëa)</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has pointed out that although one may mark the body with sacred tilaka, perform mudräs and chant mantras, if one is thinking within his mind of material sense gratification his worship of Lord Çré Hari is bogus. Therefore the word çuciù here indicates that one should worship the Lord in a favorable frame of mind, considering the Lord to be sacred and one's self to be an insignificant servant of the Lord. Those who are not favorably inclined toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead do not like to worship the Deity in the temple, and they discourage people from going to the temple of the Lord by saying that since the Lord is omnipresent there is no need to do so. Such envious persons prefer the gymnastic exercises of haöha-yoga or the räja-yoga system. But statements by the Lord Himself, such as väsudevaù sarvam iti and mäà ekaà çaraëaà vraja [Bg. 7.19], indicate that in mature transcendental realization one understands that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the source of everything and therefore the only worshipable object. Thus the devotees who worship the Deity of the Lord according to the païcarätra system are not attracted by any yoga process except bhakti-yoga.</div>

<div class="First"> The Absolute Truth can never be understood by ordinary material sense perception. The conditioned souls engrossed in the vain pursuit of material sense gratification are completely indifferent to the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Their materially conditioned minds are always impure and disturbed by the endless flow of material dualities, such as prosperity and poverty, winter and summer, fame and infamy, youth and old age. Such disturbed conditioned souls cannot recognize the personal presence of the Absolute Truth in the form of the Deity.</div>
<div class="First"> The Lord's incarnation as arcä-avatära, the Deity form, is a special manifestation of the Lord's mercy toward the materialistic or neophyte devotees who are still under the influence of material designations. They are unable to perceive the Lord in His eternal abode, and therefore the Lord descends as the Deity form, manifesting the prakäça incarnations and even the svayaà-prakäça, or the original form of the Lord. The prakäça incarnations exhibit various pastimes within this world, whereas svayaà-prakäça, the Lord's original form, is the source of all avatäras.</div>
<div class="First"> To one who sincerely worships the Deity, the Deity manifests Himself as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Those who are most unfortunate cannot even recognize the Supreme Lord in His merciful Deity expansion. They consider the Deity an ordinary material object. But by surrendering at the lotus feet of a bona fide spiritual master, who is a pure devotee of the Lord, one can learn to worship the Deity, as mentioned in this verse, and thus revive one's lost relationship with the Lord. One who considers such transcendental Deity worship to be equivalent to idol worship is grossly covered by the three modes of material nature. A person wearing rose-colored glasses sees the entire world to be rose colored. Similarly, those unfortunate living entities who are thickly covered by the material modes of nature see everything, including the Supreme Lord, as material due to their polluted vision.</div>

" The basic principle of Deity worship is that one must understand oneself to be an eternal servant of the Supreme Lord. One who is addicted to sexual gratification, foolishly identifying himself with the external material body, cannot change his conception of himself from that of an enjoyer to that of the enjoyed. Such a person interprets the word tan-mayam to mean that the worshiper is himself also the worshipable object. Çré Jéva Gosvämé Prabhupäda has written in his Durga-saìgamané, his commentary on Çré Rüpa Gosvämé Prabhu's Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu, that ahaìgrahopäsanä, or the process of worshiping oneself as the Supreme, is a gross misidentification of one's own self with the Supreme, who is actually one's eternal shelter. The six Gosvämés have repeatedly clarified this point. But unintelligent persons within the präkåta-sahajiyä community become influenced by the bogus ideas of the Mäyävädé philosophers and thus display the deluded misconception that the worshiper becomes the supreme shelter. Such a hallucination is an aparädha, an offense against the Lord. Therefore the word tan-maya in this verse should not be offensively understood to mean that the worshiper becomes equal to his eternal worshipable object.</div>

<div class="Chapnum"> 4. Drumila Explains the Incarnations of Godhead to King</div>
<div class="First"> Nimi</div>
<div class="First"> The various forms of the past, present and future incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Hari, and the various transcendental characteristics of each of these avatäras constitute the subject matter of this chapter.</div>
<div class="First"> Even if it were ever possible to count all the particles of dust on the face of the earth, any attempt to count all the innumerable transcendental qualities of the unlimited Lord Hari, the foundation of all potencies, would be simply madness. The Personality of Godhead Näräyaëa created the universe out of the five elements manufactured by His own mäyä, entered into that universe in the form of the Supersoul and became known as the Puruña-avatära. He effects the work of creation in the mode of passion through the personal form of Brahmä, of protection in the mode of goodness through the form of the Lord of sacrifice, Viñëu, and of annihilation in the mode of ignorance through the form of Rudra. Incarnating in the form of Nara-Näräyaëa, the greatest of sages, from the womb of Mürti, the daughter of Dakña and wife of Dharma, He preached by His own practical demonstration the science of naiñkarmyam. When Cupid (Kandarpa) and his hosts were sent to Badarikäçrama by King Indra, who had become fearful and envious at seeing the austerities of Lord Nara-Näräyaëa, that best of sages welcomed Cupid as an honored guest. The pacified Cupid then offered prayers to the Supreme Personality Nara-Näräyaëa Åñi. By the order of the sage, Cupid returned from there with Urvaçé and upon presenting himself before Indra related to him everything that had taken place.</div>
<div class="First"> The Personality of Godhead Lord Viñëu has appeared in various partial incarnations for the benefit of the entire world and has given instructions in spiritual knowledge in the forms of Haàsa, Dattätreya, Sanaka and the other Kumära brothers, and Åñabhadeva. In the form of Hayagréva He killed the demon Madhu and saved all the Vedas. In the avatära of Matsya, the fish, He protected both the earth and Satyavrata Manu. In the incarnation of Varäha, the boar, He delivered the earth and destroyed Hiraëyäkña; in that of Kürma, the tortoise, He carried Mandara Mountain upon His back; and in the form of Çré Hari He gave liberation to the king of the elephants. The Lord delivered the Välakhilyas, who had been trapped in the water in a cow's hoofprint, He delivered Indra from the reaction for murdering a brähmaëa, and He delivered the wives of the demigods from imprisonment in the palaces of the demoniac asuras. In the avatära of Nåsiàha, He killed Hiraëyakaçipu. In the reign of each Manu He kills the demons, fulfills the needs of the demigods and protects all the planetary systems. In the form of Vämana, the dwarf brähmaëa boy, He cheated Bali Mahäräja; in the form of Paraçuräma He rid the earth of kñatriyas twenty-one times; and in the form of Çré Räma He brought the ocean under His submission and killed Rävaëa. Descending into the Yadu dynasty, He removed the burden of the earth. In the form of Buddha, by His argumentative preaching in defiance of the Vedas He bewildered the demons who were unqualified to perform sacrifices, and at the end of Kali-yuga He will destroy the çüdra kings in His form of Kalki. In this way the innumerable appearances and activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Hari are described.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In this Fourth Chapter the son of Jayanté, Drumila, will address King Nimi. The forty-eighth verse of the Third Chapter stated, mürtyäbhimatayätmanaù: "One should worship the particular form of the Lord most attractive to oneself." Similarly it was stated in the previous chapter, stavaiù stutvä named dharim: "One should bow down to Lord Hari after glorifying Him with prayers." Thus it is assumed that the worshiper has knowledge of the Supreme Lord's transcendental qualities and pastimes in order to execute the process of worship previously described. King Nimi, therefore, is eagerly inquiring about the various incarnations of the Supreme Lord so that he can ascertain which particular form of the Supreme Lord is most suitable for his personal worship. It is understood that King Nimi is a Vaiñëava, or devotee, who is trying to advance in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="First"> It is important to note in this regard that the word abhimata-mürti, meaning "one's most desirable form," does not indicate that one may concoct a form of the Lord by one's own whim. Advaitam acyutam anädim ananta-rüpam [Bs. 5.33]. All the forms of the Supreme Lord are anädim, or eternal. Thus there is no question of concocting a form, because such a concoction would be ädi, or the origin of the concocted form. Abhimata-mürti means that among the eternal forms of the Lord one should select that form which most inspires one's love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such love cannot be imitated, but it is automatically aroused when one follows the prescribed rules and regulations given by the bona fide spiritual master and submissively hears these descriptions of Çrémad-Bhägavatam.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Çré Drumila said: Anyone trying to enumerate or describe fully the unlimited qualities of the unlimited Supreme Lord has the intelligence of a foolish child. Even if a great genius could somehow or other, after a time-consuming endeavor, count all the particles of dust on the surface of the earth, such a genius could never count the attractive qualities of the Personality of Godhead, who is the reservoir of all potencies.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In reply to King Nimi's request that the nava-yogendras describe all the qualities and pastimes of the Lord, Çré Drumila here explains that only the most foolish person would even attempt such a comprehensive description of the unlimited qualities and pastimes of the Personality of Godhead. Such foolish, childish persons, however, are far more advanced than ignorant materialistic scientists who actually try to describe all knowledge without even referring to the Personality of Godhead. In other words, although it is impossible to describe the Lord fully, foolish atheistic scientists attempt to describe all knowledge without even having reached the most preliminary knowledge of the Personality of Godhead. Such atheistic persons should be understood to be shortsighted and of very weak intelligence, despite their showy material achievements, which ultimately end in great suffering and destruction. It is said that Lord Anantadeva Himself, with His innumerable tongues, cannot even begin to vibrate completely the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The example given in this verse is very nice. No human being can hope to count the number of particles on the surface of the earth; therefore no one should foolishly try to understand the Supreme Lord by his own tiny endeavor. One should submissively hear knowledge of God as it is spoken by God Himself in Bhagavad-gétä, and thus one should gradually be elevated to the stage of hearing Çrémad-Bhägavatam. According to Caitanya Mahäprabhu, by tasting a drop of seawater one can get a general idea of the flavor of the entire ocean. Similarly, by submissively hearing about the Personality of Godhead one can acquire a qualitative understanding of the Absolute Truth, although quantitatively one's knowledge can never be complete.</div>

<div class="Translation"> When the primeval Lord Näräyaëa created His universal body out of the five elements produced from Himself and then entered within that universal body by His own plenary portion, He thus became known as the Puruña.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The words bhütaiù païcabhiù in this verse refer to the five gross material elements—earth, water, fire, air and sky—which form the basic building blocks of the material world. When the conditioned living entity enters within these five elements, consciousness becomes manifest, along with the functions of the mind and intelligence. Unfortunately, the consciousness manifest under the modes of material nature is governed by ahaìkära, or false ego, in which the living entity wrongly considers himself the enjoyer of the material elements. Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Puruñottama, enjoys His pure transcendental existence in the spiritual sky, the material elements are also meant for His enjoyment, through the process of yajïa, or sacrifice. This material world is called Devé-dhäma, or the abode of the illusory energy of the Lord, Mäyä-devé. The Brahma-saàhitä explains that the Supreme Person is not at all attracted to His inferior energy, mäyä, but when the material creation is used in the devotional service of the Lord, the Lord becomes attracted by the devotion and sacrifice of the living entities, and thus, indirectly, He is also the enjoyer of the material world. We should not think that the pastimes of Lord Näräyaëa as the Supersoul and creator of this universe are on a lower spiritual level than Näräyaëa's eternal pastimes in the spiritual world. Were Lord Näräyaëa in any way to diminish His transcendental bliss and knowledge in His activities of material creation, He would have to be considered a conditioned soul, affected by contact with the illusory potency. But since Lord Näräyaëa is eternally aloof from the influence of mäyä, His activities as the Supersoul of this universe are exactly on the same transcendental level as His activities in the spiritual world. All the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are part and parcel of His unlimited spiritual pastimes.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Within His body are elaborately arranged the three planetary systems of this universe. His transcendental senses generate the knowledge-acquiring and active senses of all embodied beings. His consciousness generates conditioned knowledge, and His powerful breathing produces the bodily strength, sensory power and conditioned activities of the embodied souls. He is the prime mover, through the agency of the material modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. And thus the universe is created, maintained and annihilated.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> When a conditioned soul becomes completely exhausted by his strenuous activities, or when he is overcome by disease, death or fear, he loses all power to manifest practical knowledge or activities. Thus we should understand that independent of the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead we can neither work nor cultivate knowledge. By the mercy of the Personality of Godhead the conditioned soul acquires a material body, which is a perverted reflection of the unlimited spiritual body of the Lord. Thus the living entity engages in ignorant materialistic activities for society, friendship and love. But the entire program suddenly vanishes with the unforeseen dissolution of the material body. Similarly, our material knowledge is always subject to become null and void within an instant, since the material nature is itself constantly changing. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the prime mover behind the birth, maintenance and destruction of the universe. And the living entity should try to understand that Personality of Godhead who has given him so much facility for illusion. The Personality of Godhead actually wants the conditioned soul to surrender to Him and regain an eternal life of bliss and knowledge at the Lord's side. The conditioned soul should reason, "If the Lord is giving me so much facility to merge into ignorance, surely He will give even more facility to come out of this ignorance if I humbly follow His direction without foolish speculations."</div>
<div class="First"> This verse describes Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, the second phase of the puruña incarnations of the Lord. This Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, who is glorified in the Puruña-sükta prayers, expands Himself as the Supersoul to enter the heart of every living being. Through chanting the holy names of the Lord—Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare—even in this degraded age one can find the Supreme Lord within one's heart. The Lord is a person as much as we are, but He is unlimited. Still, a personal loving relationship exists between the tiny living entity and the unlimited Supreme Lord. In consideration of this personal relationship, bhakti-yoga is the only suitable process by which to come to the ultimate understanding of our constitutional position as eternal servants of the Supreme Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> In the beginning, the original Supreme Personality manifested the form of Brahmä through the material mode of passion in order to create this universe. The Lord manifested His form as Viñëu, the Lord of sacrifice and protector of the twice-born brähmaëas and their religious duties, to maintain the universe. And when the universe is to be annihilated the same Supreme Lord employs the material mode of ignorance and manifests the form of Rudra The created living beings are thus always subject to the forces of creation, maintenance and destruction.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In the previous verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead was described as ädi-kartä, the original person responsible for the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the material world. According to Çrédhara Svämé, ädi-kartä, or "the original doer," implies subsequent creators, maintainers and annihilators. Otherwise there would be no meaning to the word ädi, or "original." Therefore this verse describes that the Absolute Truth expands Himself into the guëävatäras, or incarnations who carry out the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the universe through the modes of passion, goodness and ignorance respectively.</div>
<div class="First"> It is significant here that although this verse mentions creation through the material mode of passion and annihilation through the material mode of ignorance, it does not mention maintenance by Viñëu through the material mode of goodness. That is because Viñëu is viçuddha-sattva, or existing on the platform of unlimited transcendental goodness. Although Lord Çiva and Lord Brahmä are somewhat affected by their prescribed duties as superintendents of the modes of nature, Lord Viñëu is viçuddha-sattva, completely beyond contamination even by the material mode of goodness. As described in the Vedas, na tasya käryaà karaëaà ca vidyate: the Lord has no occupational duty. Whereas Lord Çiva and Lord Brahmä are understood to be servants of the Lord, Viñëu is completely transcendental.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, Viñëu, described in this verse as kratu-patiù, the Lord of sacrifice, is understood to have appeared in a previous age as the incarnation Suyajïa, the son of Prajäpati Ruci. Whereas Brahmä and Çiva faithfully engage in service to the Supreme Lord, Viñëu is the Supreme Lord Himself, and therefore His activities of maintaining the brähmaëas and religious principles, as mentioned in this verse (dvija-dharma-setuù), are not occupational duties but lélä. So in addition to being a guëävatära, Viñëu is also a lélävatära, according to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé. The Mahäbhärata (Çänti-parva) describes the birth of Lord Brahmä from the lotus flower emanating from Viñëu and the subsequent birth of Lord Çiva from the angry eyes of Lord Brahmä. Viñëu, however, is the self-manifested Personality of Godhead who enters the material universe by His own internal potency, as stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (3.8.15):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tal loka-padmaà sa u eva viñëuù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">prävéviçat sarva-guëävabhäsam</div>
<div class="First"> In conclusion, Lord Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the supreme controller whose personal form is full of eternal existence, knowledge and bliss, who is beginningless but is the beginning of everything, who is known as Govinda, and who is the original cause of all causes, as stated in Brahma-saàhitä. Still, that same eternal Lord manifests Himself as Brahmä and Çiva in the sense that the primeval controllers Brahmä and Çiva manifest the potency and supreme will of the Lord, although they themselves are not supreme.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Nara-Näräyaëa Åñi, who is perfectly peaceful and is the best of sages, was born as the son of Dharma and his wife Mürti, the daughter of Dakña. Nara-Näräyaëa Åñi taught the devotional service of the Lord, by which material work ceases, and He Himself perfectly practiced this knowledge. He is living even today, His lotus feet served by the greatest of saintly persons.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> It is understood that Nara-Näräyaëa Åñi spoke transcendental knowledge to great saintly persons such as Närada Muni. On the basis of these teachings, Närada was able to describe naiñkarmyam, or the devotional service of the Lord, which eradicates material work, as mentioned in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.3.8): tantraà sätvatam äcañöa naiñkarmyaà karmaëäà yataù. The ätma-svarüpa, or eternal form of the living entity, is devotional service to the Personality of Godhead. But our perception of our eternal form is covered by a material concept of life, just as our normal understanding of our life is covered by a dream. Naiñkarmyam, or the cessation of material work, is possible only by the devotional service of the Lord, as stated by Närada Muni himself: naiñkarmyam apy acyuta-bhäva-varjitaà na çobhate jïänam alaà niraïjanam (SB 1.5.12). The process of transforming ordinary karma into naiñkarmya, or transcendental work, is summarized by Çréla Prabhupäda in his commentary on this verse spoken by Närada Muni. "Fruitive work, in which almost all people in general are engaged, is always painful either in the beginning or at the end. It can be fruitful only when made subservient to the devotional service of the Lord. In the Bhagavad-gétä also it is confirmed that the result of such fruitive work may be offered for the service of the Lord, otherwise it leads to material bondage. The bona fide enjoyer of the fruitive work is the Personality of Godhead, and thus when it is engaged for the sense gratification of the living beings, it becomes an acute source of trouble." According to the Matsya Puräëa (3.10), Dharma, the father of Nara-Näräyaëa Åñi, was born from the right breast of Brahmä and later married thirteen of the daughters of Prajäpati Dakña. The Lord Himself appeared from the womb of Mürti-devé.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> King Indra became fearful, thinking that Nara-Näräyaëa Åñi would become very powerful by His severe penances and seize Indra's heavenly kingdom. Thus Indra, not knowing the transcendental glories of the incarnation of the Lord, sent Cupid and his associates to the Lord's residence in Badarikäçrama. As the charming breezes of spring created a most sensuous atmosphere, Cupid himself attacked the Lord with arrows in the form of the irresistible glances of beautiful women.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> This verse and the following nine verses illustrate the Personality of Godhead's opulence of supreme renunciation. The word atan-mahi-jïaù, "not understanding the glories of the Lord," indicates that King Indra was placing the Personality of Godhead on the same level as he himself, considering the Lord an ordinary enjoyer who would be attracted by mundane sex life. Indra's plot to cause the falldown of Nara-Näräyaëa Åñi could not affect the Lord, but it reveals the shortsightedness of Indra himself. Because Indra is attached to his heavenly kingdom, he took it for granted that the Supreme Lord was performing austerities to acquire such flickering phantasmagoria as the kingdom of heaven (tridaça-pür äkäça-puñpäyate).</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> The primeval Lord, understanding the offense committed by Indra, did not become proud. Instead He spoke laughingly as follows to Cupid and his followers, who were trembling before Him: "Do not fear, O mighty Madana, O wind-god and wives of the demigods. Rather, please accept these gifts I am offering you and kindly sanctify My äçrama by your presence."</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word gata-vismayaù, or "free from false pride," is very significant. If one becomes proud by performing severe penances, such penances are considered material. One should not think, "I am a great, austere personality." Çré Nara-Näräyaëa could immediately understand the foolishness of Indra, and thus He was amused by the whole situation. Cupid and the heavenly women, understanding their great offense, were trembling before Nara-Näräyaëa in fear of receiving a powerful curse. But the Lord, exhibiting most sublime saintly behavior, reassured them by saying, mä bhaiù—"Don't worry about it"—and actually offered them nice prasädam and articles of worship. "If you do not give Me the opportunity to act as host to the demigods and other respectable personalities," He said, "what will be the use of My äçrama? My äçrama will be void without the opportunity to receive respectable personalities such as you."</div>
<div class="First"> Similarly, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness is establishing beautiful centers in all the major cities of the world. In some of these centers, such as those in Los Angeles, Bombay, London, Paris and Melbourne, the Society has established very gorgeous preaching äçramas. But the Vaiñëavas who live in these beautiful buildings feel that the buildings are void if guests do not come to hear about Kåñëa and chant His holy name. Thus, one may establish a beautiful äçrama not for one's personal sense gratification but to execute Kåñëa consciousness peacefully and encourage others to take to Kåñëa consciousness also.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The demigods, headed by Kämadeva, or Cupid, recognizing their offense at the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, Nara-Näräyaëa Åñi, here point out the insignificant position of the demigods in relation to the Supreme Lord. Just as a farmer must pay a specific percentage of his agricultural profit to the king or political head as tax money, all human beings must offer a percentage of their material wealth to the demigods in sacrifice. In Bhagavad-gétä, however, the Lord explains that the demigods are also His servants and it is He Himself who awards all benedictions, through the agency of the demigods. Mayaiva vihitän hi tän. Although a Vaiñëava, or devotee of the Lord, has no need to worship the demigods, the demigods, being proud of their exalted material position, sometimes resent the exclusive devotion of the Vaiñëava to the Lord and thus try to cause the devotee to fall down, as described in this verse (sura-kåtä bahavo 'ntaräyäù). But the demigods here point out that Kåñëa is directly the protector of His devotees. Therefore, so-called impediments become stimuli for further spiritual advancement for a sincere devotee. The demigods here state, "We thought, our dear Lord, that we could disturb Your consciousness by our foolish tricks. But by Your mercy even Your devotees pay little regard to us, so why should You take our foolish behavior seriously?" The word yadi here is used to indicate the certainty that Kåñëa is always the protector of His surrendered devotees. Although there may be many obstacles on the path of the sincere devotee who is preaching the glories of the Lord, such obstacles increase the determination of the devotee. Therefore, according to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the continuous obstacles presented by the demigods form a kind of ladder or stairway upon which the devotee steadily progresses back to the kingdom of God. A similar verse appears in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (10.2.33):</div>

Nevertheless, although crossing this ocean of sense gratification through severe penances, such persons foolishly drown in a cow's hoofprint when conquered by useless anger. Thus they exhaust the benefit of their difficult austerities in vain.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Those who do not accept the devotional service of the Supreme Lord can be considered in two categories. Those engaged in sense gratification are easily conquered by the demigods through various weapons such as hunger, thirst, sexual desire, lamentation for the past and vain hoping for the future. Such materialistic fools, infatuated with the material world, are easily controlled by the demigods, who are the ultimate supplying agents of sense gratification. But according to Çrédhara Svämé, persons who attempt to subdue the desires of the material senses and thus avoid the control of the demigods without surrendering to the Supreme Lord are even more foolish than the sense gratifiers. Although crossing the ocean of sense gratification, those who perform severe penances without service to the Lord eventually drown in tiny puddles of anger. One who simply performs material penances does not actually purify his heart. By one's material determination one may restrict the activities of the senses although one's heart is still filled with material desires. The practical result of this is krodha, or anger. We have seen artificial performers of penance who have become very bitter and angry through denial of the senses. Being indifferent to the Supreme Lord, such persons do not achieve ultimate liberation, nor can they enjoy material sense gratification; rather, they become angry, and through cursing others or enjoying false pride they uselessly exhaust the results of their painful austerities. It is understood that when a yogé curses he diminishes the mystic power he has accumulated. Thus, anger gives neither liberation nor material sense gratification but merely burns up all the results of material penances and austerities. Being useless, such anger is compared to a useless puddle found in a cow's hoofprint. Thus after crossing over the ocean of sense gratification the great yogés who are indifferent to the Supreme Lord drown in puddles of anger. Although the demigods admit that the devotees of the Lord actually conquer the miseries of material life, it is understood here that a similar result is not to be obtained by so-called yogés who are not interested in devotional service to the Supreme Lord.</div>

Indeed, upon seeing the beauty and magnificence of such women, the representatives of the demigods were completely diminished in their own opulence.</div>

<div class="First"> Nara-Näräyaëa Åñi was almost laughing upon seeing the defeat of the demigods. However, being extremely grave, He did not actually laugh. Although the demigods might have thought, "We are simply low-class fools in comparison to these women," the Lord encouraged them to choose one of the women, whomever they considered equal in character to themselves. The beauty thus selected would become the ornament of heaven.</div>

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Fourth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Drumila Explains the Incarnations of Godhead to King Nimi."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 5. Närada Concludes His Teachings to Vasudeva</div>
<div class="First"> In this chapter the destination of persons who are inimical to the worship of Lord Hari, who are unable to control their own senses and who are not peaceful is examined, along with the different names, forms and modes of worship of the Personality of Godhead in each yuga.</div>
<div class="First"> From the face, arms, thighs and feet of the primeval person Lord Viñëu are born (correspondingly and in order of the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance) the four varëas-brähmaëa and so on-and also the four different äçramas. If the members of the four varëas and four äçramas do not worship Lord Çré Hari, who is Himself directly the origin of their own creation, they will simply fall down. Among these classes, women and çüdras, who generally have no contact with the hearing and chanting of hari-kathä, are on account of their very ignorance special candidates for the mercy of great souls. The members of the other three varëas, becoming fit for achieving the lotus feet of Hari by second birth through Vedic initiation (çrauta-janma), nevertheless become confused by concocted interpretations of the Vedas. Presuming themselves to be great scholars, although not understanding the essential meaning of karma, they become flatterers of other deities in their greed for fruitive results and ridicule the devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They are fixed in family life, attached to mundane gossip and indifferent to the devotional service of Viñëu and the Vaiñëavas. They are maddened by material opulences and pleasures, devoid of real discrimination and intelligence and always function on the mental platform. But such attachment to family life and so on is most natural for the mass of people, even though it is against the best advice of çästra. To become disentangled from such life in all respects is the principal teaching of the Vedas. Real wealth is that conducive to the faithful execution of the duty of the soul, not that which exists simply for selfish sense gratification. As a consequence of the desire to indulge the senses, men and women couple together to produce children. Engaging in animal slaughter apart from that necessary for performance of sacrifice, these human animals themselves suffer violence in the next life. If because of excessive greed for one's own pleasure one commits violence against living beings. He is also attacking Lord Çré Hari, who is present in the bodies of all living entities as the Supersoul. Opposed to Lord Väsudeva, ignorant self-cheaters completely carry out their own ruination and enter into hell. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Hari, accepts in each of the different yugas various colors, names and forms and is worshiped by various prescribed processes. In Satya-yuga the Supreme Lord is white in complexion, has four arms, dresses as a brahmacäré, is known by such names as Haàsa and is served by the practice of meditational yoga. In Tretä-yuga He is red in color and four-armed, is the personification of sacrifice, is characterized by the symbols of the sacrificial spoon, ladle, etc., is called by such names as Yajïa and is worshiped by Vedic sacrifices. In Dväpara-yuga He is of dark blue complexion, wears a yellow garment, is marked by Çrévatsa and other signs, has such names as Väsudeva and is worshiped in His Deity form by the regulations of the Vedas and tantras. In Kali-yuga He is golden in color, is accompanied by associates who are His primary and secondary limbs and His weapons, is absorbed in kåñëa-kértana and is worshiped by the performance of saìkértana-yajïa. Since in Kali-yuga all the goals of human life can be achieved simply by the glorification of the holy name of Lord Çré Hari, those who can appreciate the real essence of things praise Kali-yuga. In Kali-yuga many people in South India (Draviòa-deça), in places where the Tämraparëé, Kåtamälä, Käveré and Mahänadé rivers flow, will be dedicated to the devotional service of the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> Persons who give up all false ego and take full shelter of Lord Hari are no longer debtors to the demigods or anyone else. The Personality of Godhead, Çré Hari, appears in the hearts of devotees who know no other shelter than Him and causelessly drives away all evil desires from the devotees' hearts. Videharäja Nimi, having heard elaborate descriptions of bhägavata-dharma from the mouths of the nava-yogendras, offered worship to them with a satisfied mind. They then disappeared.</div>
<div class="First"> Devarñi Närada thereupon instructed Vasudeva about the ultimate shelter of devotional service. He told Vasudeva that although Lord Kåñëa had become his son, having appeared in this world to free the earth of its burden, he still should not think of Lord Kåñëa as his child, but rather as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even by meditating upon Kåñëa in a spirit of enmity, such kings as Çiçupäla attained an equal status to Him. So to attempt to say anything more about the perfect achievement of great souls such as Vasudeva, who enjoy intimate loving relations with Kåñëa, would be a useless endeavor.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In the Fifth Chapter of the Eleventh Canto, Camasa Åñi describes the inauspicious path of those who are unfavorable to the devotional service of Lord Viñëu, and the sage Karabhäjana explains the yuga-dharmävatäras, the incarnations of the Lord who present the authorized process of religion for each different age.</div>
<div class="First"> In the previous chapter it was explained that although the demigods place obstacles in the path of the Lord's devotees, by the mercy of the Supreme Lord the devotees are able to place their feet on the head of such obstacles and thus pass beyond them to the supreme destination. However, for the nondevotees there is no such facility. As soon as the conditioned soul becomes indifferent to the devotional service of the Supreme Lord, he is immediately attracted by the temporary varieties of matter and becomes a slave of inauspicious desires. Thus the conditioned soul, devoid of devotion for the Lord, completely forgets the transcendental bliss of the spiritual world, which is enjoyed in five transcendental rasas. Although the devotees are not overcome by the sense gratification offered by the demigods, the demigods themselves become absorbed in material form, taste and smell. And similarly, those who are nondevotees also become bound by material form, taste and other sense perceptions, such as the sensuous experience of sex life. Thus they remain hovering in a dreamlike state, imagining different types of material sense gratification, and forget their eternal relationship with the Personality of Godhead. Videharäja Nimi now inquires from Camasa Muni about the goal attained by such bewildered persons.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Çré Camasa said: Each of the four social orders, headed by the brähmaëas, was born through different combinations of the modes of nature, from the face, arms, thighs and feet of the Supreme Lord in His universal form. Thus the four spiritual orders were also generated.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Those who are not spontaneously attracted to the devotional service of the Lord can be gradually purified by observing the varëäçrama system of four social orders and four spiritual orders. According to Çrédhara Svämé, the brähmaëas are born of the mode of goodness, the kñatriyas of a combination of goodness and passion, the vaiçyas of a combination of passion and ignorance and the çüdras of the mode of ignorance. Just as the four social orders are born from the face, arms, thighs and feet of the Lord's universal form, similarly the brahmacärés are generated from the heart of the Lord, the householder order from His loins, the vänaprasthas from His chest and the sannyäsa order from His head.</div>
<div class="First"> A similar verse is found in the Åk-saàhitä (8.4.19), as well as the Çukla-yajur Veda (34.11) and the Atharva Veda (19.66):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">brähmaëo 'sya mukham äséd</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bähü räjanyaù kåtaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ürü tad asya yad vaiçyaù</div>

<div class="First"> "The brähmaëa appeared as His face, the king as His arms, the vaiçya as His thighs, and the çüdra was born from His feet."</div>
<div class="First"> It is understood that pure devotional service to the Lord has already been described by two of the Yogendras, Drumila and Ävirhotra. Camasa Muni now describes the system of varëäçrama-dharma, because this system is meant to gradually purify those who are inimical to the Supreme Lord, bringing them back to their constitutional position of love of Godhead. Similarly, the viräö-rüpa, or universal form of the Lord, is an imaginary form meant to help the gross materialists gradually understand the position of the Personality of Godhead. Since the foolish materialist cannot understand anything beyond matter, he is encouraged to see the entire universe as a personal form of the Supreme Lord's body. The impersonal conception of formlessness is a mere negation of temporary material variety without any concept of the Lord's spiritual potency. The impersonal view is another kind of material speculative conception. The Supreme Lord is full of spiritual potencies under the principal headings hlädiné, or unlimited bliss, sandhiné, or eternal existence, and saàvit, or omniscience. It is understood from this verse that the varëäçrama-dharma system generated from the universal form of the Lord is a program offered by the Lord to engage the conditioned souls in a complete social and religious system that gradually brings them back home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation"> If any of the members of the four varëas and four äçramas fail to worship or intentionally disrespect the Personality of Godhead, who is the source of their own creation, they will fall down from their position into a hellish state of life.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The words na bhajanti in this verse refer to those who out of ignorance do not worship the Supreme Lord, whereas the word avajänanti refers to those who have actually been informed of the supreme position of the Lord but still show Him disrespect. It has already been described that the four spiritual and occupational orders of life are generated from the body of the Lord. In fact, the Supreme Lord is the source of everything, as described in Bhagavad-gétä (10.8): ahaà sarvasya prabhavaù. Those who foolishly do not inquire into the position of the Personality of Godhead, as well as those who disrespect the Lord in spite of having heard of His transcendental position, will certainly fall down from the varëäçrama-dharma system, as described by the words sthänäd bhrañöäù. The words patanty adhaù indicate that one who falls from the varëäçrama system will have no means of avoiding sinful activities; nor will such a person receive any credit for performing sacrifice, and thus he will gradually sink down into lower and lower species of life in hellish conditions. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has pointed out that the original cause of offending the Lord and falling down from one's position is one's not learning how to properly worship a bona fide spiritual master. One who is trained to offer respectful obeisances and worship to the bona fide spiritual master automatically offers proper worship to the Supreme Lord. Without the mercy of a bona fide spiritual master, even a so-called religious man will gradually become atheistic, offend the Lord by foolish speculation and fall into a hellish condition of life. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has pointed out that the puruña mentioned in this verse is Lord Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, who is glorified in the Puruña-sükta prayers. If one is proud of his high social position and enviously thinks that the Lord is also a creation of nature and that there is no absolute entity who is the origin of all beings, then such a puffed-up fool will certainly fall down from the varëäçrama system and become just like an unregulated animal.</div>

<div class="Translation"> There are many persons who have little opportunity to take part in discussions about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, and thus it is difficult for them to chant His infallible glories. Persons such as women, çüdras and other fallen classes always deserve the mercy of great personalities like yourself.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In the previous verse it was explained that some persons are ignorant of the glories of the Personality of Godhead (na bhajanti), whereas others, although aware of the Lord, ridicule Him or state that the Lord is also material (avajänanti). In this verse the first class, namely the ignorant, are described as fit candidates for the mercy of a pure devotee. The word düre indicates those who have little opportunity to hear and chant the glories of the Lord. According to Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura they can be explained as ye sädhu-saìga-bhägya-hénäù, those who are bereft of the association of saintly persons and pure devotees. Generally, those who are advanced in the spiritual science of Kåñëa consciousness avoid contact with women and low-class men. In general, women are lusty, and çüdras and other low-class men are habitually addicted to materialistic habits such as smoking, drinking and woman hunting. Therefore, Caitanya Mahäprabhu warned the sädhus, or saintly persons, to avoid intimate connection with women and low-class men. The practical result of such a restriction is that women and lower-class men are often bereft of the opportunity to hear the glories of the Lord chanted by saintly persons; thus Çré Camasa Muni instructs the King that he should especially give his mercy to such fallen persons.</div>
<div class="First"> Our spiritual master, His Divine Grace Çréla Prabhupäda, was severely criticized in India for giving all classes of men and women the opportunity to take part in the Kåñëa consciousness movement. Indeed, the caste brähmaëas of India and other persons concerned only with ritualistic formalities were shocked that Çréla Prabhupäda allowed women and persons born in low-class families to take part freely in the Vaiñëava culture and even become initiated as bona fide brähmaëas. However, Çréla Prabhupäda could understand that in this age practically everyone is fallen. He saw that if spiritual life were to be limited to the so-called higher classes, there would be no possibility of spreading a genuine spiritual movement all around the world. The mercy of Caitanya Mahäprabhu is so great and the holy name of Kåñëa so potent that any man, woman, child or even animal can become purified by chanting Kåñëa's name and taking prasädam, the sanctified remnants of Kåñëa's food. In Caitanya Mahäprabhu's movement, no sincere person is restricted from achieving the highest perfection of self-realization. Whereas the impersonalists and yogés tend to be selfishly concerned with their individual realization and achievement of mystic power, it has always been the custom of the Vaiñëavas to be merciful to all classes of living entities.</div>
<div class="First"> It is understood that the conversation between the nava-yogendras and King Nimi took place approximately at the time of Lord Rämacandra, many hundreds of thousands of years ago. But in the Bhagavad-gétä, which was spoken only five thousand years ago, Lord Kåñëa Himself also states that any person, despite his material situation of life, can become the most dear devotee of the Lord by full surrender to the lotus feet of Kåñëa. Therefore, the fallen people of Kali-yuga should take advantage of the special mercy of the Vaiñëavas and join the Kåñëa consciousness movement to perfect their lives and go back home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation"> On the other hand, brähmaëas, members of the royal order and vaiçyas, even after being allowed to approach the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, Hari, by receiving the second birth of Vedic initiation, can become bewildered and adopt various materialistic philosophies.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> It is said that a little knowledge can be very dangerous. Those who are falsely proud of material social status and who thus neglect to perfect their worship of the Personality of Godhead are condemned in this verse. Muhyanty ämnäya-vädinaù: becoming attracted by the sense gratification of high status within the varëäçrama social system, such persons become more attracted to illusory material philosophy than to the Absolute Truth, which is not material. Within the Vedic system, brähmaëas, kñatriyas and vaiçyas, as mentioned in this verse, are all offered initiation into the Gäyatré mantra and are considered twice-born, or highly civilized men. By studying Vedic literature, chanting Vedic mantras, executing ritualistic ceremonies and worshiping the spiritual master and the Personality of Godhead such persons gradually come near to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord. If one in such an exalted position becomes proud of his status or fascinated by the heavenly material enjoyment that is undoubtedly available to the followers of the varëäçrama system, then one so bewildered returns to the illusory material platform of birth and death. Even the highly posted demigods become victims of mäyä's enticement, as described in the first verse of Çrémad-Bhägavatam: muhyanti yat sürayaù. In order to justify their illusory desire to enjoy dead matter, such foolish persons condemn themselves by minimizing the necessity of worshiping the Personality of Godhead (avajänanti) and falsely try to give equal importance to the karma-käëòa section of the Vedas, which awards heavenly sense gratification in exchange for the performance of prescribed ritualistic ceremonies. Such bogus rationalizers are described in Bhagavad-gétä (2.42):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yäm imäà puñpitäà väcaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">pravadanty avipaçcitaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">veda-väda-ratäù pärtha</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nänyad astéti vädinaù</div>
<div class="First"> "Men of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of the Vedas, which recommend various fruitive activities for elevation to the heavenly planets, resultant good birth, power and so on. Being desirous of sense gratification and opulent life, they say that there is nothing more than this."</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Prabhupäda's purport to this verse of Bhagavad-gétä gives a clear picture of the offensive class of men described therein. "People in general are not very intelligent, and due to their ignorance they are most attached to the fruitive activities recommended in the karma-käëòa portions of the Vedas. They do not want anything more than sense gratificatory proposals for enjoying life in heaven, where wine and women are available and material opulence is very common. In the Vedas many sacrifices are recommended for elevation to the heavenly planets, especially the jyotiñöoma sacrifices. In fact, it is stated that anyone desiring elevation to heavenly planets must perform these sacrifices, and men with a poor fund of knowledge think that this is the whole purpose of Vedic wisdom. It is very difficult for such inexperienced persons to be situated in the determined action of Kåñëa consciousness. As fools are attached to the flowers of poisonous trees without knowing the results of such attractions, similarly, unenlightened men are attracted by such heavenly opulence and the sense enjoyment thereof.</div>
<div class="First"> "In the karma-käëòa sections of the Vedas it is said that those who perform the four monthly penances become eligible to drink the soma-rasa beverage to become immortal and happy forever. Even on this earth some are very eager to have soma-rasa to become strong and fit to enjoy sense gratification. Such persons have no faith in liberation from material bondage, and they are very much attached to the pompous ceremonies of Vedic sacrifices. They are generally sensual, and they do not want anything other than the heavenly pleasures of life. It is understood that there are gardens called Nandana-känana, in which there is good opportunity for association with angelic, beautiful women and having a profuse supply of soma-rasa wine. Such bodily happiness is certainly sensual; therefore there are those who are purely attached to material, temporary happiness, as lords of the material world." The significant point in this verse is that such bewildered materialists who have become attracted to the materialistic portions of the Vedas (muhyanty ämnäya-vädinaù) desire to ignore the supreme proprietorship of the Personality of Godhead, who is the supreme enjoyer (bhoktäraà yajïa-tapasäm [Bg. 5.29]). And at the same time they wish to preserve their exalted status as followers of the Vedic principles. Such duplicitous persons take shelter of materialistic philosophers, such as Jaimini, who deny the existence of God as a tangible principle (éçvaräsiddheù) and therefore recommend material fruitive activities as the highest knowable truth. Such so-called Vedic philosophers amount to little more than polished atheists and are therefore understood to be anéçvara-vädinaù, or those who preach against the supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although foolish materialistic followers of the varëäçrama system desire to maintain their exalted status as Äryans, or twice-born men, and at the same time neglect the Personality of Godhead, it is clearly stated in the Bhägavatam (11.5.3), sthänäd bhrañöäù patanty adhaù: such persons inevitably fall from their position into a degraded condition of life. As confirmed in this verse by the word muhyanti, they fall into the darkness of ignorance. Sometimes such pompous persons even present themselves as gurus. However, Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has pointed out that they are actually laghu, or flimsy, rather than guru, or heavy with Vedic knowledge. It is one's ultimate duty to oneself (svärtha-gati) and to the Personality of Godhead to give up all materialistic activities characterized by karma and jïäna and surrender fully at the lotus feet of the Lord. Only the most unfortunate person will consider that there is a higher pleasure than ecstatic surrender at the lotus feet of Gokulänanda, the Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The words karmaëy akovidäù refer to those who are ignorant of the art of performing work in such a way that there will be no future bondage. This art is described in Bhagavad-gétä: yajïärthät karmaëo 'nyatra loko 'yaà karma-bandhanaù [Bg. 3.9]). Work must be performed for the satisfaction of Viñëu, otherwise work is the cause of future bondage in the cycle of repeated birth and death. The word stabdhäù, "puffed up by false pride," indicates that although ignorant persons do not know the art of working properly, they do not inquire from learned devotees, nor do they accept the advice of the Lord's own men. Being infatuated by the fruitive results offered in the Vedas, such mürkhas, or fools, think, "We are learned Vedic scholars; we have understood everything perfectly." Thus they are attracted to such Vedic statements as apäma somam amåtä abhüma ("We have drunk the soma juice and now we are immortal"), akñayyaà ha vai cäturmäsya-yäjinaù sukåtaà bhavati ("For one who executes the cäturmäsya sacrifice there is inexhaustible pious reaction"), and yatra noñëaà na çétaà syän na glänir näpy arätayaù ("Let us go to that material planet where there is no heat, no cold, no diminution and no enemies"). Such foolish persons are unaware that even Lord Brahmä, the creator of the universe, will die at the end of universal time, what to speak of materialistic followers of the Vedas who jump like frogs to the different celestial planets, seeking the highest standard of sense gratification. Such bewildered Vedic scholars dream of frolicking with the Apsaräs, the gorgeous society girls of the heavenly planets who are expert in singing, dancing and in general stimulating uncontrollable lusty desires. Thus, those who are carried away by the heavenly phantasmagoria offered in the karma-käëòa section of the Vedas gradually develop an atheistic mentality. Actually, the entire universe is meant to be offered to Lord Viñëu as sacrifice. The conditioned soul can thereby gradually elevate himself to the eternal kingdom beyond the hallucination of material sense gratification. However, being puffed up by false pride, the materialistic followers of the Vedas remain perpetually ignorant of the supremacy and beauty of Lord Viñëu.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The materialistic followers of Vedic rituals, giving up the worship of the Lord, instead practically worship their wives, and thus their homes become dedicated to sex life. Such materialistic householders encourage one another in such whimsical behavior. Understanding ritualistic sacrifice as a necessary item for bodily maintenance, they perform unauthorized ceremonies in which there is no distribution of foodstuffs or charity to the brähmaëas and other respectable persons. Instead, they cruelly slaughter animals such as goats without any understanding of the dark consequences of their activities.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> False pride is certainly not complete without sex indulgence. Thus, lusty materialistic householders are not attracted to worshiping saintly persons, but rather worship their wives as a source of constant sex pleasure. The mentality of such condemned persons is described by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gétä (16.13):</div>

<div class="First"> "So much wealth do I have today, and I will gain more according to my schemes. So much is mine now, and it will increase in the future, more and more."</div>
<div class="First"> Generally, materialistic householders consider themselves to be very religious. In fact, by earning money to support a band of relatives they consider themselves to be more pious than the "irresponsible" sädhus, who do not struggle to maintain family members. Worshiping the material body, they are contemptuous of the humble brähmaëas, who are generally not very advanced in economic development. They consider such so-called beggars to be unworthy objects of charity and instead perform sacrifices only for the enhancement of the false prestige of their own family members. Madhväcärya has stated in this regard, upekñya vai harià te tu bhütvä yäjyäù patanty adhaù. In spite of proudly considering themselves to be great performers of religious ceremonies, those who neglect the Lord and His devotees certainly fall down. Such foolish persons sometimes bless each other by saying, "May you be blessed with the wealth of gorgeous flower garlands, sandalwood pulp and beautiful women."</div>
<div class="First"> Men who are controlled by the nature of women become exactly like women. Materialistic women are uninterested in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord and strive for their own selfish happiness. Therefore they eagerly take service from their husbands and become most discouraged if the husband prefers to serve the Personality of Godhead. Being lost in such a fool's paradise, both husband and wife mutually encourage each other in temporary happiness. They do not like to speak or hear about the pastimes of the Lord, but prefer to discuss their own families. Still, the devotees of the Lord, being mature in the mode of goodness, are always ready to act mercifully toward such conditioned souls, who are just like vain animals. When the devotees of the Lord preach that human beings should not slaughter animals, materialistic householders are very often astonished and inquire if it is actually possible to subsist on a vegetarian diet. Thus being completely ignorant of the material mode of goodness, what to speak of spiritual knowledge, such condemned materialists have no hope beyond the mercy of the devotees of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The Personality of Godhead is eternally situated within the heart of every embodied being; still the Lord remains situated apart, just as the sky, which is all-pervading, does not mix with any material object. Thus the Lord is the supreme worshipable object and the absolute controller of everything. He is elaborately glorified in the Vedic literature, but those who are bereft of intelligence do not like to hear about Him. They prefer to waste their time discussing their own mental concoctions, which inevitably deal with gross material sense gratification such as sex life and meat-eating.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In Bhagavad-gétä Lord Kåñëa says, vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù [Bg. 15.15]. The goal of all Vedic knowledge is to know the Lord, who is the Absolute Truth. Although this purpose of the Vedas is clearly revealed both in the Vedic literature itself and by the self-realized äcäryas, foolish people cannot grasp this simple truth. They prefer to cultivate knowledge of illicit sex by discussing their sexual partners and experiences. They also eagerly describe and recommend to their friends the best restaurants for eating meat, and they are fond of glorifying drugs and liquor by elaborately describing the drunken and hallucinogenic effects of their sinful experiences. The materialistic sense gratifiers eagerly call one another on the telephone, congregate in clubs and committees, and enthusiastically go on hunting, drinking and gambling excursions, thus filling their lives with the mode of ignorance. They have neither the time nor the inclination to discuss the Absolute Truth, Kåñëa. Unfortunately, they neglect the Supreme Lord, who therefore severely punishes such foolish persons in order to bring them back to their senses. Everything belongs to the Lord, and everything is meant for the Lord's enjoyment. When the living entity dovetails his activities for the pleasure of the Lord, he experiences unlimited happiness. Yena sattvaà çuddhyed yasmäd brahma-saukhyaà tv anantam [SB 5.5.1]. There is actually no happiness in material affairs, and the Lord mercifully punishes the intoxicated conditioned soul to bring him back to his real life.</div>
<div class="First"> Unfortunately, materialistic persons do not heed the advice of the Supreme Lord in Bhagavad-gétä or that of the Lord's representatives, who speak in allied literatures such as Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Instead, such sense gratifiers consider themselves to be most eloquent and learned. Every materialistic person actually feels that he is the most intelligent person, and thus he has no time to hear the actual truth. Nevertheless, the Personality of Godhead, as described in this verse, waits patiently within the heart of the conditioned soul, encouraging him to recognize the Lord, who is sitting beside him. Such recognition of the Personality of Godhead is the beginning of all auspiciousness and happiness for the conditioned soul.</div>

Such materialistic persons are unwilling to give up such temporary gratification because they are firmly bound up in the bodily concept of life. For such persons there are numerous Vedic injunctions for rituals that bestow material sense pleasure in a regulated manner. The conditioned soul thereby becomes accustomed to indirectly worshiping the Supreme Lord by accepting the austerity of regulated sense gratification in obedience to the Vedic way of life. Through purification the living entity gradually develops a higher taste and becomes directly attracted to the spiritual nature of the Lord. Sometimes the fallen practitioners of the karma-käëòa section of the Vedas assert that the material fruitive results of Vedic ceremonies should never be given up, because they are prescribed by religious scriptures. For example, there is a Vedic injunction that in the proper season a husband must approach his wife at night at least five days after her menstrual period, if the wife has properly bathed and cleansed herself. Thus, a responsible householder should engage in religious sex life.</div>
<div class="First"> The injunction that one must approach his wife for sex life is explained by the Vaiñëava äcäryas as follows. Within the material world almost every man is very lusty and desires passionate sex life with every attractive woman he meets, or with any woman at all. Actually, for an ordinary materialistic man it is an accomplishment if he can restrict himself to relationships with his lawfully wedded wife. But because familiarity breeds contempt, the natural tendency is for the husband to gradually become envious or resentful of the wife and desire illicit connections with other women. Such a mentality is most sinful and abominable, and the Vedic scripture therefore orders that one must approach his actual wife, with a desire to beget children, and thus curtail the tendency toward illicit sexual connection with other women. Were there no such Vedic injunction ordering one to approach his wife, many men would naturally be inclined to neglect their wives and pollute other women by illicit connection.</div>
<div class="First"> However, such an injunction for conditioned souls does not apply to great souls who are fixed on the spiritual platform and are transcendental to material sex desire. As stated in this verse, nivåttir iñöä: the actual purpose of the Vedic scriptures is to bring one back home, back to Godhead, back to the spiritual world. It is clearly stated by Lord Kåñëa in Bhagavad-gétä, yaà yaà väpi smaran bhävaà tyajaty ante kalevaram: [Bg. 8.6] whatever we think of at the time of death will determine our next body.</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">anta-kale ca mäm eva</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">smaran muktvä kalevaram</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yaù prayäti sa mad-bhävaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yäti nästy atra saàçayaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">(Bg. 8.5)</div>
<div class="First"> If one remembers Kåñëa, he is immediately transferred to the eternal planet of Kåñëa. Therefore, since all the Vedic scriptures are meant for knowing Kåñëa (vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù [Bg. 15.15]), the ultimate goal of the Vedas cannot be any type of absorption in the material senses, either licit or illicit. The Vedic regulations governing married sex life are actually meant to prevent sinful illicit sex. However, one should not foolishly conclude that a lusty attraction to his wife's naked body is the perfection of self-realization and Vedic elevation. The actual perfection of spiritual life is to become free from all material desires, nivåtti, and to fix the mind on Kåñëa. Similarly there are other injunctions, governing the regulated consumption of liquor and meat. Those who are mad after meat-eating are instructed to perform Vedic ceremonies by which they are permitted to consume five types of five-clawed animals, namely the rhinoceros, turtle, rabbit, porcupine and lizard. Similarly, the consumption of specific liquors is allowed during highly restricted sacrifices performed on specific days of the year at great expense. In this way, other types of drunkenness and cruel animal slaughter are prohibited. One is gradually purified by performing such sacrifices, and he develops a distaste for such foolish activities as meat-eating and the drinking of liquor. The Vedic rules and regulations that gradually restrict sense gratification are called vidhi. The word niyama refers to injunctions governing activities that human beings ordinarily would not be inclined to perform. For example, it is said, ahar ahaù sandhyäm upäséta: "One should chant Gäyatré mantra at the three junctions of the day, every day." It is also stated, mägha-snänaà prakurvéta: "One must take bath daily, even during the coldest months of winter." Such injunctions prescribe activities that ordinarily would be neglected.</div>
<div class="First"> Although it has been mentioned above that there are injunctions against neglecting one's lawful wife, there is no injunction against totally neglecting meat-eating. In other words, killing of animals is considered most abominable, and although some concession is made for the more violent class of men, one should actually completely give up this cruel activity because even a slight discrepancy in animal sacrifices will cause havoc in one s life. It should be understood that those who have become spiritually advanced by chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra under the guidelines of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu are expected to completely give up material sense gratification. If a devotee of Kåñëa duplicitously tries to take advantage of the scriptural allowances for meat-eating, intoxication or sex enjoyment, then he commits the tenth offense against chanting. Especially if one has accepted the renounced order of life called tridaëòi-sannyäsa, it is most abominable and reprehensible to become attracted to the Vedic injunctions prescribing regulated sex life for householders. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé there is no such allowance for one in the renounced order of life. The Vaiñëava sannyäsés should not foolishly become bewildered by statements in the Vedic literature such as the following verse from Manu-saàhitä:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na mäàsa-bhakñaëe doño</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na madye na ca maithune</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">pravåttir eñä bhütänäà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nivåttis tu mahä-phalä</div>
<div class="First"> "It may be considered that meat-eating, intoxication and sex indulgence are natural propensities of the conditioned souls, and therefore such persons should not be condemned for these activities. But unless one gives up such sinful activities, there is no possibility of achieving the actual perfection of life."</div>
<div class="First"> In the Kriyä-vidhäna it is explained that sex is permitted only during the vämadeva sacrifice, or the garbhädhäna-saàskära for begetting of religious children. It is also stated that sometimes certain types of meat are used in worshiping Lord Hari through sacrifices to the forefathers and demigods. Similarly, there is a form of intoxication available through drinking the soma beverage. But if a so-called brähmaëa becomes attracted to such offerings, he immediately becomes polluted. Actually, the brähmaëas who performed such offerings would not personally accept any type of liquor or meat. These things would be consumed by the kñatriyas, who were not considered at fault in accepting such remnants of sacrifice.</div>
<div class="First"> However, in the movement of Caitanya Mahäprabhu it can be observed that those who desire to become advanced devotees of Kåñëa immediately give up all such fruitive sacrifices. There is no scope in pure devotional service for any type of fruitive sacrifices. Caitanya Mahäprabhu demanded that all of His sincere followers engage twenty-four hours a day in çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù [SB 7.5.23], hearing and chanting the glories of the Personality of Godhead. Those who claim to be followers of Caitanya Mahäprabhu and who are seriously planning on going back home, back to Godhead, in the near future should not become mindlessly attracted by Vedic fruitive rituals that are meant to attract those who are hopelessly bound up in the material, bodily concept of life. The followers of Caitanya Mahäprabhu always remain aloof from such tainted rituals.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The only proper fruit of acquired wealth is religiosity, on the basis of which one can acquire a philosophical understanding of life that eventually matures into direct perception of the Absolute Truth and thus liberation from all suffering. Materialistic persons, however, utilize their wealth simply for the advancement of their family situation. They fail to see that insurmountable death will soon destroy the frail material body.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Those things that come under the control of the proprietor are called dhanam, or wealth. When a foolish person becomes addicted to spending all of his hard-earned money to increase the prestige of his material body and family, he is no longer able to see how death is steadily approaching his own body as well as the temporary bodies of his family and friends. Måtyuù sarva-haraç cäham: [Bg. 10.34] the Supreme Lord appears as all-powerful death, which destroys all material situations. Actually, even in family life one should use one's wealth for spiritual advancement of oneself and one's family. In the Kåñëa consciousness movement there are many religious householders who live a simple, peaceful life and use their wealth for arranging Kåñëa conscious activities at home and for helping the renounced brahmacärés and sannyäsés who are actively preaching Kåñëa consciousness in public places. Such householders, even those who are not able to dedicate one hundred percent of their energy to Kåñëa consciousness, gradually acquire a very solid understanding of the spiritual principles of life and eventually become transcendentalists firmly fixed at the lotus feet of Kåñëa. Thus they free themselves from all of the anxieties of conditional life, namely birth, old age, disease and death.</div>
<div class="First"> Life without Kåñëa consciousness is actually poverty, but the poverty-stricken materialist, whose intelligence is limited, cannot perceive that real wealth is the expansion of consciousness up to the highest level of Kåñëa consciousness, love of Godhead. Such persons raise their children to be just like animals, having as their only goal false prestige and material sense gratification. Such materialistic householders fear that excessive interest in spiritual life may damage the ambition of their children to acquire false material prestige. Actually, death will smash all of the endeavors and plans of such spiritually impoverished materialists. If family life and wealth are used for Kåñëa consciousness, one will learn to discriminate between the eternal and the noneternal, between spirit and matter, between bliss and anxiety, and thus the living entity will become liberated and go beyond mere theoretical knowledge to acquire the highest perfectional benediction of eternal Kåñëa conscious life. Limited sensory knowledge, pratyakña-jïäna, is useless without theoretical spiritual knowledge, parokña-jïäna, which gradually matures, with careful cultivation, into direct realized knowledge of the soul, aparokña-jïäna. The word anupraçänti in this verse indicates that by spiritual knowledge (vijïänam) one achieves the most sublime state of eternal peace and bliss, far beyond the dreams of the materialistic conditioned soul.</div>

<div class="Translation"> According to the Vedic injunctions, when wine is offered in sacrificial ceremonies it is later to be consumed by smelling, and not by drinking. Similarly, the sacrificial offering of animals is permitted, but there is no provision for wide-scale animal slaughter. Religious sex life is also permitted, but only in marriage for begetting children, and not for sensuous exploitation of the body. Unfortunately, however, the less intelligent materialists cannot understand that their duties in life should be performed purely on the spiritual platform.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Madhväcärya has given the following statement in regard to animal sacrifice:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yajïeñv älabhanaà proktaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">devatoddeçataù paçoù</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">ato läbhäd älabhanaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">svargasya na tu märaëam</div>
<div class="First"> According to this statement, the Vedas sometimes prescribe animal sacrifice in ritual performances for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord or a particular demigod. If, however, one whimsically slaughters animals without rigidly following the Vedic prescriptions, such killing is actual violence and should not be accepted by any intelligent person. If the animal sacrifice is perfectly performed, the sacrificed animal immediately goes to the heavenly planets of the demigods and the forefathers. Therefore such a sacrifice is not for killing animals but for demonstrating the potency of Vedic mantras, by the power of which the sacrificed creature is immediately promoted to a higher situation. Caitanya Mahäprabhu, however, has forbidden such animal sacrifice in this age because there are no qualified brähmaëas to chant the mantras, and the so-called sacrificial arena becomes an ordinary butcher shop. And in an earlier era, when unscrupulous persons tried to establish that animal killing and meat-eating are acceptable by misinterpreting the Vedic sacrifices, Lord Buddha personally appeared and rejected their heinous proposition. This is described by Jayadeva Gosvämé:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nindasi yajïa-vidher ahaha çruti-jätaà</div>

<div class="First"> Unfortunately, the conditioned souls are afflicted by four imperfections, one of which is the cheating propensity, and thus they tend to exploit the concessions that the Lord mercifully gives to them in religious scriptures for their gradual purification. Rather than follow the Vedic injunctions for simultaneously satisfying their senses and gradually elevating themselves, the conditioned souls reject the actual purpose of such apparently materialistic ceremonies and simply become more and more degraded in the ignorance of the bodily concept of life. Thus they fall down altogether from the varëäçrama system and, taking birth in violent non-Vedic societies, foolishly presume the small fragments of universal religious principles prevalent there to be the exclusive religion of the soul. As a result, they fall into fanaticism, embracing merely sectarian, dogmatic views of religion. Such unfortunate persons are completely out of touch with their own eternal function in life and consider things to be vastly different than they are in reality.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In this verse we can clearly see the great discrepancies in those persons who do not surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His law. As stated in the Bhägavatam, haräv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guëäù: those who do not accept the supremacy of the Supreme Lord gradually become infected with the most sinful propensities that bring, in their turn, terrible suffering upon the nondevotees. In the Western countries such as America, many people proudly proclaim themselves to be most pious religionists and sometimes even prophets or representatives of God. Boasting of their religiosity, such foolish people experience no fear or doubt in cruelly slaughtering innumerable animals in slaughterhouses or on hunting trips for their whimsical sense gratification. In the state of Mississippi there are sometimes pig-killing festivals, in which entire families enjoy watching a pig cruelly butchered before their eyes. Similarly, a former president of the United States from Texas did not consider any social occasion complete without the slaughtering of a cow. Such persons mistakenly consider themselves to be perfectly observing the laws of God and due to such arrogant foolishness lose all touch with reality. When a man is raising an animal for slaughter, he feeds the animal nicely and encourages it to grow fat. Thus the animal gradually accepts its would-be killer as its protector and master. When the master finally approaches the helpless animal with a sharp knife or gun, the animal thinks, "Oh, my master is joking with me." Only at the last minute does the animal understand that the so-called master is death personified. It is clearly stated in Vedic literature that cruel masters who kill innocent animals will undoubtedly be killed in the next life by a similar process.</div>

(SB 4.25.7-8) Such punishment of animal killers may take place under the jurisdiction of Yamaräja on the planet of the lord of death. In other words, one who kills an animal or who eats meat undoubtedly acquires a debt to the living entity who has contributed his body for the satisfaction of the meat-eater. The meat-eater must pay his debt by contributing his own body to be consumed in the next life. Such payment of one's debt by offering one's own body to be eaten is confirmed in the Vedic literature.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Those who are completely in the darkness of ignorance and thus bereft even of material pious life commit innumerable sinful activities and suffer greatly. Due to such intense suffering such persons sometimes seek the shelter of the devotees of the Lord and, being blessed by such transcendental association, are sometimes elevated to the highest perfectional stage of Kåñëa consciousness.</div>
<div class="First"> Those who are not completely sinful experience some mitigation of the miseries of material life and thus develop a false sense of well-being within the material world. Because those who are materially pious generally obtain worldly prosperity, bodily beauty and a pleasant family situation, they become falsely proud of their position and are not inclined to associate with or accept instructions from the devotees of the Lord. Unfortunately, all material activities, whether pious or impious, are inevitably contaminated by sinful activity. Those who are proud of their piety and do not like to hear about Kåñëa sooner or later fall down from their artificial position. Every living entity is an eternal servant of Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, until we surrender to Kåñëa, our position is actually always impious. The word akñaëikäù ("not having even a moment to reflect") is significant in this verse Materialistic persons cannot spare a single moment for their eternal self-interest. This is a symptom of misfortune. Such persons are considered to be killing their own souls because by their obstinacy they are preparing a dark future for themselves from which they will not escape for a very long time. A sick man receiving medical treatment may be encouraged by the preliminary results of the doctor's care. But if the patient becomes falsely proud of the preliminary progress in his treatment and prematurely gives up the doctor's orders, thinking himself already cured, there will undoubtedly be a relapse. The words ye kaivalyam asampräptäù in this verse clearly indicate that material piety is a long way from perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth. If one gives up his spiritual progress before achieving the lotus feet of Kåñëa, he will undoubtedly fall back down into the most unpleasant material situation, even if he has achieved impersonal realization of the Brahman effulgence.

The result is simply anxiety as the conditioned soul struggles to maintain his temporary wife, children, friends, home, nation, etc. Finally all of these things are taken away, and the bewildered soul, in great frustration, sometimes tries to take shelter of an impersonal concept of God and liberation. Thus the conditioned soul is always in ignorance, either pursuing illusory sense gratification or trying to avoid sense gratification by merging into the impersonal aspect of the Lord, called Brahman. But the actual position of the living entity is to serve the Supreme Person, who is his master. And unless one gives up one's inimical feelings toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no question of peace or happiness.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The sage Karabhäjana Muni is replying to Videharäja Nimi's questions about the varieties of the Lord's incarnations. In Satya-yuga the Lord's color is white, and He wears tree bark and a black deerskin as an ideal meditative brahmacäré. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has explained the Lord's various names in Satya-yuga as follows. Those who are self-realized know this supreme reality of the Personality of Godhead as Paramätmä, Those souls who are situated in the religious system of varëäçrama glorify Him as the haàsa who is transcendental to all the varëas and äçramas. Persons absorbed in gross matter consider Him to be Suparëa, "the beautifully winged" basis of the conceptions of cause and effect who flies within the subtle sky of the soul, as described in Chändogya Upaniñad. Persons accustomed to wandering within this universe of subtle and gross matter created by the Lord's illusory potency chant His name Vaikuëöha. Persons deprived of the power of transcendental meditation (dhäraëä), who are thus subject to falling from the path of religion, glorify Him as Dharma, or religion personified. Those who are forced to submit to the illusory modes of material nature and whose minds are uncontrolled and disturbed glorify Him as the most perfectly self-controlled Yogeçvara. Persons tainted by a mixture of the modes of passion and ignorance call Him Amala, or the uncontaminated. Persons devoid of potency call Him Éçvara, and those who consider themselves to be under His shelter chant His glories by the name Uttama Puruña. Those who know that this material manifestation is only temporary call Him Avyakta. In this way, in Satya-yuga Lord Väsudeva appears in various four-armed transcendental forms, and the jéva souls worship Him, each by their own particular process of devotional service. Therefore the Supreme Lord has many different names.</div>

However, it should be noted that all of the exalted qualities of the people of Satya-yuga are not mentioned in this verse. In other words, in Satya-yuga people are automatically perfect, whereas in Tretä-yuga people are inclined to become perfect through performing Vedic sacrifice. In Tretä-yuga human society is not automatically Kåñëa conscious, as it was in Satya-yuga, but people are still highly inclined to become Kåñëa conscious, and thus they strictly follow the Vedic injunctions.</div>

<div class="First"> The Lord's transcendental body in Dväpara-yuga can be compared to the color of a dark blue flower. The Lord exhibits His personal transcendental weapons such as Sudarçana cakra, and all of the limbs of His body, especially His hands and feet, are decorated with auspicious symbols such as a lotus flower and a flag. And on His chest, the Lord manifests the Kaustubha jewel as well as the auspicious Çrévatsa, a whorl of hair curling from left to right on the right side of the Lord's chest. Actually, such auspicious marks as Kaustubha and Çrévatsa, as well as the weapons of the Lord, are present in all of the viñëu-tattva incarnations. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains that these universal characteristics of the Lord mentioned by the sage Karabhäjana are indications of the Kåñëa avatära. Because Kåñëa is the source of all incarnations, all of the symptoms of all other incarnations are to be found in His transcendental body.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear King, in Dväpara-yuga men who desire to know the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the supreme enjoyer, worship Him in the mood of honoring a great king, following the prescriptions of both the Vedas and tantras.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> When Lord Kåñëa was leaving the city of Hastinäpura, Arjuna personally held an umbrella over the Lord, and Uddhava and Sätyaki fanned the Lord with decorated fans (SB 1.10.17, 18). In this way, Emperor Yudhiñöhira and his followers worshiped Kåñëa as the greatest of noble kings and as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, at the Räjasüya sacrifice all of the great souls of the universe elected Kåñëa as the King of all kings, the greatest personality, deserving of first worship. Such reverential worship of the Lord is characteristic of Dväpara-yuga, as described in this verse (mahä-räjopalakñaëam). With each successive yuga, namely Satya, Tretä, Dväpara and Kali, the condition of human society deteriorates more and more. As mentioned in this verse, the only favorable qualification of the residents of Dväpara-yuga is that they are jijïäsavaù, strongly desirous of knowing the Absolute Truth. Otherwise there is no good qualification mentioned. The inhabitants of Satya-yuga were described as çäntäù, nirvairäù, suhådaù and samäù, or peaceful, free from envy, the well-wishers of every living entity, and fixed on the spiritual platform beyond the modes of material nature. Similarly the inhabitants of Tretä-yuga were described as dharmiñöhäù and brahma-vädinaù, or thoroughly religious, and expert followers of the Vedic injunctions. In the present verse, the inhabitants of Dväpara-yuga are said to be simply jijïäsavaù, desiring to know the Absolute Truth. Otherwise they are described as martyäù, or subject to the weakness of mortal beings. If the human society of even Dväpara-yuga was clearly inferior to that of Satya and Tretä-yugas, we can hardly imagine the truly disastrous condition of human society in Kali-yuga. Therefore, as will be mentioned in the following verses, human beings who have taken their birth in the present age of Kali should attach themselves rigidly to the movement of Caitanya Mahäprabhu to free themselves from foolishness.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains that although Lord Kåñëa appeared at the end of Dväpara-yuga, great sages chanted this verse from the beginning of that age in expectation of His appearance.</div>
<div class="First"> Ordinary living entities, although eternally subordinate to the Lord, become absorbed in attempting to dominate the material creation yet ultimately remain under the control of the Supreme Lord. The constitutional position of the living entity is engagement in the Lord's service. It is further the constitutional position of the material nature to be engaged by the living entity in satisfying the transcendental desires of the Lord. Thus these prayers, as mentioned in this verse, are offered to the Supreme Lord in accordance with the Païcarätra and the Vedic mantras so that one may become fixed in remembering his eternal subordination to the Absolute Truth. The supreme living entity, Kåñëa, eternally manifests Himself as the catur-vyüha, or quadruple plenary expansion. The purport of this prayer is that one should give up his false ego and pray to this catur-vyüha by offering Them obeisances. Although the Absolute Truth is one without a second, the Absolute Truth displays His unlimited opulences and potencies by expanding Himself in innumerable plenary forms, of which the catur-vyüha is a principal expansion. The original being is Väsudeva, the Personality of Godhead. When the Godhead manifests His primeval energies and opulences, He is called Saìkarñaëa. Pradyumna is the basis of the Viñëu expansion who is the soul of the entire universe, and Aniruddha is the basis of the personal manifestation of Viñëu as the Supersoul of every individual entity within the universe. Among the four plenary expansions mentioned here, the original expansion is Väsudeva, and the other three are considered to be particular manifestations of Him.</div>
<div class="First"> When the living entity forgets that both he himself as well as the material nature are meant for the Lord's service, the quality of ignorance becomes prominent, and the conditioned entity desires to become himself the master. Thus the conditioned soul imagines that he is a very important person within society or that he is a great philosopher. The Vedic mantras and Païcarätra give mankind instructions about devotional service to the Personality of Godhead, which free one from the contamination of considering oneself a prestigious member of society or a great philosopher. One in knowledge should recognize himself as a tiny servant of the Supreme Absolute Truth. In Dväpara-yuga, Deity worship of the Lord is prominent. Such Deity worship is ultimately aimed at the process of çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù [SB 7.5.23]. Without hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord one cannot perform Deity worship. In Deity worship it is required that the worshiper glorify the names, forms, qualities, paraphernalia, entourage and pastimes of the Supreme Lord. When such glorification is complete, the worshiper becomes eligible to realize transcendental knowledge through hearing about the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> O King, in this way people in Dväpara-yuga glorified the Lord of the universe. In Kali-yuga also people worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead by following various regulations of the revealed scriptures. Now kindly hear of this from me.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The words kaläv api, "in Kali-yuga also," are very important in this verse. It is well known that Kali-yuga is an irreligious age. Thus it is surprising that in such a completely irreligious age the Supreme Lord is worshiped. Therefore it is stated kaläv api, "even in Kali-yuga." In Kali-yuga the incarnation of the Personality of Godhead does not directly assert Himself to be the Personality of Godhead, but rather He is detected by expert devotees in accordance with the revealed Vedic scriptures. Similarly, Prahläda Mahäräja states in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (7.9.38):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">itthaà nå-tiryag-åñi-deva-jhañävatärair</div>

<div class="First"> "In this way, my Lord, You appear in various incarnations as a human being, an animal, a great saintly demigod, a fish or a tortoise, thus maintaining the entire creation in different planetary systems and killing the demoniac principles. According to the age, O my Lord, You protect the principles of religion. In the age of Kali, however, You do not assert Yourself as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore You are known as Triyuga, or the Lord who appears in three yugas." Thus it is understood that it is difficult for common people in Kali-yuga to recognize the incarnation of the Lord since in this age the Lord's appearance is slightly concealed.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura the word nänä-tantra-vidhänena indicates the importance in Kali-yuga of the Vaiñëava scriptures known as the Païcarätras or Sätvata-païcarätras. It is stated in the Bhägavatam, stré-çüdra-dvija-bandhünäà trayé na çruti-gocarä: [SB 1.4.25] in Kali-yuga it is impossible for ordinary people to perform highly technical Vedic sacrifices or the unbearable penances of the mystic yoga system. Such standard Vedic processes are practically inaccessible for the spiritually retarded population of Kali-yuga. Therefore the simple process of glorifying the Personality of Godhead by chanting His holy names is essential in this age. Such devotional processes as chanting the holy names of the Lord and worshiping His Deity form are elaborately described in the Vaiñëava çästras known as Païcarätras. Such tantric scriptures are referred to in this verse, and it is stated that in Kali-yuga these devotional processes, taught by great äcäryas such as Närada Muni, are the only practical means for worshiping the Lord. This will be more clearly explained in the following verse.</div>

<div class="Translation"> In the age of Kali, intelligent persons perform congregational chanting to worship the incarnation of Godhead who constantly sings the names of Kåñëa. Although His complexion is not blackish, He is Kåñëa Himself. He is accompanied by His associates, servants, weapons and confidential companions.</div>

<div class="First"> This same verse is quoted by Kåñëadäsa Kaviräja in the Caitanya-caritämåta, Ädi-lélä, Chapter Three, verse 52. His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda has given the following commentary on this verse. "This text is from Çrémad-Bhägavatam (11.5.32). Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has explained this verse in his commentary on the Bhägavatam known as the Krama-sandarbha, wherein he says that Lord Kåñëa also appears with a golden complexion. That golden Lord Kåñëa is Lord Caitanya, who is worshiped by intelligent men in this age. That is confirmed in Çrémad-Bhägavatam by Garga Muni, who said that although the child Kåñëa was blackish, He also appears in three other colors—red, white and yellow. He exhibited His white and red complexions in the Satya and Tretä ages respectively. He did not exhibit the remaining color, yellow—gold, until He appeared as Lord Caitanya, who is known as Gaurahari.</div>
<div class="First"> "Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains that kåñëa-varëam means Çré Kåñëa Caitanya. Kåñëa-varëam and Kåñëa Caitanya are equivalent. The name Kåñëa appears with both Lord Kåñëa and Lord Caitanya Kåñëa. Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but He always engages in describing Kåñëa and thus enjoying transcendental bliss by chanting and remembering His name and form. Lord Kåñëa Himself appears as Lord Caitanya to preach the highest gospel. Varëayati means 'utters' or 'describes.' Lord Caitanya always chants the holy name of Kåñëa and describes it also, and because He is Kåñëa Himself, whoever meets Him will automatically chant the holy name of Kåñëa and later describe it to others. He injects one with transcendental Kåñëa consciousness, which merges the chanter in transcendental bliss. In all respects, therefore, He appears before everyone as Kåñëa, either by personality or by sound. Simply by seeing Lord Caitanya one at once remembers Lord Kåñëa. One may therefore accept Him as viñëu-tattva. In other words, Lord Caitanya is Lord Kåñëa Himself.</div>
<div class="First"> "Säìgopäìgästra-pärñadam further indicates that Lord Caitanya is Lord Kåñëa. His body is always decorated with ornaments of sandalwood and with sandalwood paste. By His superexcellent beauty He subdues all the people of the age. In other descents the Lord sometimes used weapons to defeat the demoniac, but in this age the Lord subdues them with His all-attractive figure as Caitanya Mahäprabhu. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains that His beauty is His astra, or weapon, to subdue the demons. Because He is all-attractive, it is to be understood that all the demigods lived with Him as His companions. His acts were uncommon and His associates wonderful. When He propagated the saìkértana movement, He attracted many great scholars and äcäryas, especially in Bengal and Orissa. Lord Caitanya is always accompanied by His best associates like Lord Nityänanda, Advaita, Gadädhara and Çréväsa. "Çréla Jéva Gosvämé cites a verse from the Vedic literature that says that there is no necessity of performing sacrificial demonstrations or ceremonial functions. He comments that instead of engaging in such external, pompous exhibitions, all people, regardless of caste, color or creed, can assemble together and chant Hare Kåñëa to worship Lord Caitanya. Kåñëa-varëaà tviñäkåñëam [SB 11.5.32] indicates that prominence should be given to the name Kåñëa. Lord Caitanya taught Kåñëa consciousness and chanted the name of Kåñëa. Therefore, to worship Lord Caitanya, everyone should together chant the mahä-mantra—Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. To propagate worship in churches, temples or mosques is not possible because people have lost interest in that. But anywhere and everywhere, people can chant Hare Kåñëa. Thus worshiping Lord Caitanya, they can perform the highest activity and fulfill the highest religious purpose of satisfying the Supreme Lord. "Çréla Särvabhauma Bhaööäcärya, a famous disciple of Lord Caitanya, said: 'The principle of transcendental devotional service having been lost, Çré Kåñëa Caitanya has appeared to deliver again the process of devotion. He is so kind that He is distributing love of Kåñëa. Everyone should be attracted more and more to His lotus feet, as humming bees are attracted to a lotus flower.' " The incarnation of Caitanya Mahäprabhu is also described in the Çré Viñëu-sahasra-näma, which appears in Chapter 189 of the Däna-dharma-parva of Mahäbhärata. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has quoted this reference as follows: suvarëa-varëo hemäìgo varäìgaç candanäìgadé. "In His early pastimes He appears as a householder with a golden complexion. His limbs are beautiful, and His body, smeared with the pulp of sandalwood, seems like molten gold." He has also quoted, sannyäsa-kåc chamaù çänto niñöhä-çänti-paräyaëaù: "In His later pastimes He accepts the sannyäsa order, and He is equipoised and peaceful. He is the highest abode of peace and devotion, for He silences the impersonalist nondevotees."</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The incarnation of the Personality of Godhead in Kali-yuga is described and worshiped in this verse. The sage Karabhäjana, after describing the incarnation of Godhead in each of the three previous yugas-Satya, Tretä and Dväpara—presented suitable prayers which are utilized for glorifying the Lord in each particular age. After describing the Lord's manifestation in Kali-yuga with the verse kåñëa-varëaà tviñäkåñëam [SB 11.5.32], this and the next verse are now presented to glorify the Lord's appearance in Kali-yuga as Caitanya Mahäprabhu, kåñëa-varëam. Caitanya Mahäprabhu appears in Kali-yuga and teaches everyone to chant the holy name of Kåñëa. The members of the ISKCON movement are so much absorbed in kåñëa-varëam, or chanting the holy names of Kåñëa, that sometimes ordinary persons refer to them as "the Kåñëas." Thus whoever comes into contact with Caitanya Mahäprabhu's movement immediately begins to worship Kåñëa by chanting His holy name. The words dhyeyaà sadä, or "always to be meditated upon," indicate that there are no hard-and-fast rules in this age for chanting the holy names of Kåñëa. In Kali-yuga the authorized process of meditation is to chant the holy names of the Lord, especially the mantra Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. This process is to be executed constantly and always (sadä). Similarly, Caitanya Mahäprabhu stated, nämnäm akäri bahudhä nija-sarva-çaktis taträrpitä niyamitaù smaraëe na kälaù: in Kali-yuga, the Supreme Lord has kindly invested all of His potencies in His holy name, and there are no hard-and-fast rules for chanting such names. The mention of such rules refers to käla-deça-niyama, or regulations of time and place. Normally there are strict regulations governing the time, season, place, conditions, etc., under which one may execute a particular Vedic ceremony or chant a particular mantra. However, one should chant the holy name of Kåñëa everywhere and at all times, twenty-four hours a day. Thus there is no restriction in terms of time and place. This is the meaning of Caitanya Mahäprabhu's statement. The word paribhava-ghnam is significant in this verse. In Kali-yuga human society is infected with enviousness. There is great envy, even among members of the same family, who constantly quarrel in this age. Similarly, neighbors are envious of each other and of each other's possessions and status. And entire nations, burning with envy, go to war unnecessarily at the risk of genocide caused by terrible modern weapons. But all of these harassments caused by family members, strangers, so-called friends who are unfaithful, opposing nations, financial competition, social disgrace, cancer, etc., can be relieved by taking shelter of the lotus feet of Caitanya Mahäprabhu. It is not possible to save the material body, but one who takes shelter of Caitanya Mahäprabhu loosens the hard knot of the heart that psychologically binds him to the hallucination of identifying with the external body or the subtle material mind. Once this false identification is broken, one can be blissful in any adverse material condition. Those who foolishly try to make the temporary body eternal are wasting their time and neglecting the actual process for making life permanent, which is to take shelter of the lotus feet of Caitanya Mahäprabhu, who is Kåñëa Himself.</div>
<div class="First"> In this verse the word térthäspadam means that the lotus feet of Caitanya Mahäprabhu are the shelter of all holy places. As the Kåñëa consciousness movement spreads all over the world, we often find, especially in poor third-world countries, that it is very difficult for people to travel to India to visit the most exalted holy places such as Våndävana and Mäyäpur. Especially in South America it is very difficult for a large number of devotees to visit such places in India and purify themselves. But Caitanya Mahäprabhu is so merciful that simply by worshiping Him, Vaiñëavas throughout the world receive the benefit of having visited the supreme holy place, namely the lotus feet of Caitanya Mahäprabhu. Thus there is no loss for the followers of the Kåñëa consciousness movement, despite their external situation. In this regard, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has stated, kalau dravya-deça-kriyädi-janitaà durväram apävitryam api näçaìkanéyam iti bhävaù. In this age the world is so polluted by sinful life that it is very difficult to become free from all of the symptoms of Kali-yuga. Still, one who is faithfully serving in the missionary work of Caitanya Mahäprabhu need not fear occasional, unavoidable symptoms of Kali-yuga. The followers of Caitanya Mahäprabhu strictly follow the four regulative principles of no illicit sex, no intoxication, no meat-eating and no gambling. They try to always chant Hare Kåñëa and engage in the service of the Lord. However, it may happen that by accident an occasional symptom of Kali-yuga such as envy, anger, lust, greed, etc., may momentarily appear in the life of a devotee. But if such a devotee is actually surrendered at the lotus feet of Caitanya Mahäprabhu, by His mercy such an unwanted symptom, or anartha, will quickly disappear. Therefore, a sincere follower of the Lord should never be discouraged in the execution of his prescribed duty but should be confident that he will be protected by Caitanya Mahäprabhu.</div>
<div class="First"> It is also mentioned in this verse, çiva-viriïci-nutam. Lord Çiva and Lord Brahmä are undoubtedly the two most powerful personalities within this universe. Still, they meticulously worship the lotus feet of Caitanya Mahäprabhu. Why? Çaraëyam. Even Lord Çiva and Lord Brahmä are not safe without the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> The words bhåtyärti-haà praëata-päla indicate that if one simply bows down without duplicity at the lotus feet of the Lord (praëata), then the Lord will give such a sincere candidate all protection. This verse does not mention that one need be an exalted devotee of the Lord. Rather, it is stated that if one simply bows down at the Lord's lotus feet he will get all protection, and this also applies to anyone who is trying to serve the mission of Caitanya Mahäprabhu. Even the neophyte will get all protection by the mercy of the Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> In regard to the words bhaväbdhi-potam, or "a suitable boat for crossing the ocean of material existence," there is the following statement by Lord Brahmä and other demigods in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam: tvat-päda-potena mahat-kåtena kurvanti go-vatsa-padaà bhaväbdhim. "By accepting Your lotus feet as the boat by which to cross the ocean of nescience, one follows in the footsteps of the mahäjanas and can cross that ocean as easily as one steps over the hoofprint of a calf." According to Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé, a follower of Caitanya Mahäprabhu is jévan-mukta, or a liberated soul. Thus the devotee is not worried about his future destination, for he is confident that the Lord will quickly take him across the ocean of material existence. Such confidence is referred to in the Upadeçämåta by the word niçcayät, meaning firm conviction about the potency of the process of devotional service. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the statement çiva-viriïci-nutam is also understood to indicate that Caitanya Mahäprabhu is worshiped by Lord Çiva's incarnation Advaita Äcärya and by Lord Brahmä's incarnation Haridäsa Öhäkura.</div>
<div class="First"> Caitanya Mahäprabhu is addressed in this verse as mahä-puruña, meaning puruñottama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, there is reference to mahäprabhu in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad (3.12), mahän prabhur vai puruñaù sattvasyaiña pravartakaù: "The supreme prabhu is the Personality of Godhead, who is the initiator of the entire cosmos." Similarly, Lord Çré Gaurakåñëa is addressed by the word mahäpuruña in this verse, and the whole intention of this verse is to offer obeisances at His lotus feet. Such lotus feet are the actual eternal object of meditation because they cut off the bondage of material life and fulfill the desires of the devotees. Although the conditioned souls laboring arduously under illusion pursue many temporary goals in life, there is no possibility of their achieving actual bliss or knowledge. Such eternal bliss and knowledge is actually wealth. One should not neglect the lotus feet of Caitanya Mahäprabhu, taking Him to be an ordinary person, and instead accept the temporary, useless shelter offered by the illusory energy of the Lord. Those yogés who falsely select some other object of meditation besides the lotus feet of the Lord are simply creating obstructions to their own eternal life. When the meditator, the meditation and the object of meditation are all on the eternal platform of the Lord, then actual shelter has been achieved. Generally the conditioned souls are engaged in bhoga-tyäga. Sometimes they run madly after material prestige and sense gratification, and sometimes they desperately try to renounce these things. However, beyond this vicious cycle of alternating sense gratification and renunciation are the lotus feet of the Lord, which constitute the ultimate abode of peace and happiness for the living entity.</div>

<div class="First"> dhyeyam—the object indicated by the word dhémahi in the Gäyatré mantra. térthäspadam—the original shelter of holy places headed by Çré Gauòakñetra and Vraja-maëòala; or the original shelter, namely the lotus feet of the Lord, of the great devotees of the Brahma-sampradäya following in the succession of faithful hearing. The succession of faithful hearing begins with Çrémad Änandatértha (Madhväcärya) and is continued by the rüpänuga mahä-bhägavatas, the highly elevated followers of Rüpa Gosvämé and Caitanya Mahäprabhu.</div>

<div class="First"> bhaväbdhi-potam—the means of crossing over the ocean of saàsära; or the shelter of those who are freeing themselves from material existence, which afflicts the living entity in the form of hankering for liberation or material enjoyment. Such persons who took advantage of this transcendental boat of the Lord's lotus feet are Särvabhauma Bhaööäcärya, who was saved from mukti-käma, or desire for liberation, and Pratäparudra Mahäräja, who was saved from bhukti-käma, or the desire for material opulence.</div>

Being the most faithful follower of the path of religion, You thus left for the forest in obedience to a brähmaëa's curse.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to the Vaiñëava äcäryas, this important verse of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam is understood to describe Caitanya Mahäprabhu, Lord Kåñëa and also Lord Çré Rämacandra. This verse appears within the discussion by the sage Karabhäjana of the yugävatäras, or the different incarnations of the Personality of Godhead who deliver the conditioned souls of each age. The prayers ending with the words vande mahäpuruña te caraëäravindam are understood to glorify the incarnation of Lord Kåñëa in Kali-yuga known as Caitanya Mahäprabhu. Caitanya Mahäprabhu lived for twenty-four years in Navadvépa as a householder and enjoyed immense popularity among both scholars and ordinary persons. His saìkértana movement was completely supported by the local government, even though it was Muslim. And Caitanya Mahäprabhu had the pleasure of marrying the goddess of fortune. No ordinary woman of the material world, no matter how gorgeous she may be, can in any way compare with the beautiful goddess of fortune. Everyone in the universe, including Lord Brahmä, is searching after the goddess of fortune. Therefore it is stated here, surepsita.</div>
<div class="First"> However, Caitanya Mahäprabhu is Lord Kåñëa appearing as a brähmaëa, and therefore He is certainly dharmiñöhaù, or the most religious. Actually the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always dharmiñöhaù, whether He appears as a cowherd boy, a great king or a brähmaëa, because the Lord Himself is the original source and personification of all religious principles. However, in the pastimes of Caitanya Mahäprabhu there are very few political or economic activities. Caitanya Mahäprabhu appeared as a great philosopher—brähmaëa, and thus He is certainly dharmiñöhaù. In Caitanya-caritämåta, in the Seventeenth Chapter of the Ädi-lélä, it is described that a certain brähmaëa, who was well known for being harsh and cursing others, could not enter the kértana hall where Caitanya Mahäprabhu was performing kértana because the door was locked. Being very agitated and breaking his brähmaëa's thread, he cursed Caitanya Mahäprabhu the next day on the bank of the Ganges, saying, "I shall now curse You, for Your behavior has greatly aggrieved me. You shall be bereft of all material happiness." However, Caitanya Mahäprabhu felt great jubilation within Himself, since His mission was</div>
<div class="First"> vairägya-vidyä-nija-bhakti-yoga [Cc. Madhya 6.254]—to give up the illusion of material sense gratification and staunchly engage twenty-four hours a day in the devotional service of the Lord. Therefore, Caitanya Mahäprabhu took this curse as a blessing, and soon after, the Lord took sannyäsa. Thus it is stated in this verse that by the words of the Äryan, the brähmaëa (ärya-vacasä), Caitanya Mahäprabhu took sannyäsa (yad agäd araëyam) and went traveling through the different forests of India on the way to Våndävana, and later South India. Caitanya Mahäprabhu wanted especially to preserve the prestige of the brähmaëa class, and therefore He decided to keep the brähmaëa's curse intact.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has explained the word mäyä-mågam as follows. Mäyä means one's so-called wife, children and bank account, which keep one firmly bound up in the material bodily concept of life. The word mågam indicates mågyati, or "to search out." Thus, mäyä-mågam indicates the conditioned living entity, who is always frantically searching for the latest up-to-the-minute sense gratification in the material bodily concept of society, friendship and love. Anvadhävat indicates that Caitanya Mahäprabhu was always visibly going here and there, searching after the fallen conditioned souls. Caitanya Mahäprabhu would sometimes embrace the conditioned souls on the pretext of religious friendship or ecstasy. But actually, the Lord was touching the bodies of the conditioned souls to pull them out of the ocean of material existence and hurl them into the ocean of ecstatic love of Godhead. Thus Caitanya Mahäprabhu was the most merciful and munificent incarnation of the Lord, whose mercy surpassed the bounds of mundane discrimination in the matter of caste, color and creed. The word dayitayä can be explained as follows. The Sanskrit word dayä means "mercy." Thus, by grammatical derivation, the word used in this verse, dayitayä, indicates that because of being the most merciful, Caitanya Mahäprabhu was busily engaged in rescuing the fallen conditioned souls, who are completely distracted and bewildered by the external illusory energy of the Lord. The quality of being the most merciful is part and parcel of the character of the mahä-puruña, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, this verse also describes the incarnation of Lord Kåñëa Himself in His original blackish form. Thus the words surepsita-räjya-lakñmém indicate çré-mathurä-sampattim, or the opulence of Mathurä. Mathurä is described in Vedic literature as the reservoir of all opulence because of the touch of the Lord's lotus feet in that precinct. But Kåñëa, although taking birth in the opulent city of Mathurä, transferred Himself to the forest village of Våndävana. In this case the word ärya-vacasä indicates the order of Lord Kåñëa's original parents, Vasudeva and Devaké. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam (10.3.22, 29) both Vasudeva and Devaké express their fear at the threat of Kaàsa, who had already killed all of Kåñëa's elder brothers. The word ärya-vacasä thus indicates that with great love they requested Kåñëa to kindly make some arrangement to avoid Kaàsa. And Kåñëa, to obey their order, transferred Himself to the forest village of Våndävana (yad agäd araëyam).</div>
<div class="First"> In this context, the words mäyä-mågam indicate the special, exalted relationship between Çrématé Rädhäräëé and Çré Kåñëa. Mäyä also indicates the internal potency of Kåñëa, yoga-mäyä. The original form of Kåñëa's internal potency is Çrématé Rädhäräëé. Due to the inconceivable love of Çrématé Rädhäräëé, Lord Kåñëa becomes easily controlled by Her. Thus, mågam, or "animal" in this case indicates kréòä-mågam, or "a toy animal." Just as a beautiful young girl may play with so many dolls or stuffed animals, similarly Lord Kåñëa becomes just like a doll in the hands of the most beautiful young girl, Çrématé-Rädhäräëé. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, Çrématé Rädhäräëé performed innumerable types of worship in order to bind Kåñëa more and more to Her because Çrématé Rädhäräëé cannot live without Kåñëa. Thus, due to Çrématé Rädhäräëé's ärädhana, or worship, Kåñëa can never leave Våndävana. He runs here and there in Våndävana, protecting the cows, playing with His friends and engaging in countless intrigues of love with Çrématé Rädhäräëé and the gopés. Thus the word anvadhävat indicates Kåñëa's boyish activities, His running throughout the transcendental land of Våndävana, tightly under the control of the love of Çrématé Rädhäräëé. Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has explained how this verse also describes the incarnation of Lord Çré Rämacandra. Although the Lord is completely independent and detached from everything, He becomes attached to His pure devotees due to their love for Him. In the great capital of Ayodhyä all of the citizens loved Rämacandra more than can be described. In this context ärya-vacasä means that by the order of His father, who was just like His guru, Rämacandra gave up everything and went to the forest. There He exhibited His great affection for mother Sétä and chased after mäyä-mågam, or the illusory deer that had been created by the trick of Rävaëa. That this golden deer was especially desired by Çrématé Sétädevé is indicated by the word dayitayepsitam.</div>
<div class="First"> All of the limbs of the Lord's transcendental body are nondifferent and interchangeable, as stated in Brahma-saàhitä (5.32):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">aìgäni yasya sakalendriya-våttimanti</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">paçyanti pänti kalayanti ciraà jaganti</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">änanda-cinmaya-sad-ujjvala-vigrahasya</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi</div>
<div class="First"> All of the limbs (aìgäni) of the Supreme Lord are sakalendriya-våttimanti, or possessing all of the functions of all of the other limbs. Thus the two lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead are a plenary representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and worshiping the Lord's lotus feet immediately places the worshiper in the ocean of transcendental bliss. There is no factual difference in spiritual quality between the incarnations of Caitanya Mahäprabhu, Lord Kåñëa and Lord Çré Rämacandra. As stated in Vedic literatures, advaitam acyutam anädim ananta-rüpam [Bs. 5.33]. Therefore there is no contradiction in the opinions of the äcäryas that this verse wonderfully glorifies three different manifestations of the one Absolute Truth. Caitanya Mahäprabhu is undoubtedly the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His transcendental attributes fulfill in every sense of the term the descriptions of the Absolute Truth as given in Vedic literature. In Caitanya-caritämåta, in the Third Chapter of the Ädi-lélä, Kåñëadäsa Kaviräja Gosvämé and Çréla Prabhupäda have given elaborate explanations of the transcendental status of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, which the reader can refer to for further information.</div>
<div class="First"> Everyone should follow the example of the sage Karabhäjana and worship the lotus feet of the Mahäprabhu, the mahä-puruña, Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. One should not rot on the platform of mental speculation and whimsical interpretation but should actually revive his lost relationship with the Absolute Truth by surrendering to Caitanya Mahäprabhu. Those who are worshiping Caitanya Mahäprabhu are deriving wonderful spiritual results and are tasting the fruit of love of Kåñëa. Therefore, vande mahä-puruña te caraëäravindam: let us humbly bow down at the lotus feet of the original Personality of Godhead, Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, who is the mahä-puruña glorified within Çrémad-Bhägavatam.</div>
<div class="First"> Corroborating the explanation of this verse, the followers of Caitanya Mahäprabhu also worship Him in His six-armed form of ñaò-bhuja. Two arms carry the waterpot and daëòa of the sannyäsé Caitanya Mahäprabhu, two arms carry the flute of Lord Kåñëa, and two arms carry the bow and arrow of Çré Rämacandra. This ñaò-bhuja form is the actual purport of this verse of Çrémad-Bhägavatam.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Thus, O King, the Supreme Lord Hari is the giver of all desirable benefits of life. Intelligent human beings worship the particular forms and names that the Lord manifests in different ages.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word yugänurüpäbhyäm is significant here. Anurüpa means "suitable" or "appropriate." The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, anxiously desires that all conditioned living entities come back home, back to Godhead, for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge. Thus, the Lord reveals Himself in each of the four ages—Satya, Tretä, Dväpara and Kali—in a form appropriate for worship by the human beings of that age. In his Laghu-bhägavatämåta (Pürva-khaëòa 1.25), Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé states:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kathyate varëa-nämäbhyäà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">çuklaù satya-yuge hariù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">raktaù çyämaù kramät kåñëas</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tretäyäà dväpare kalau</div>
<div class="First"> "The Supreme Lord Hari is described in terms of His color and names as çukla [white, or the most pure] in Satya-yuga, and as red, dark blue and black respectively in Tretä, Dväpara and Kali." Thus, although in each age various names suitable for glorifying the Lord are given, such as Haàsa and Suparëa in Satya-yuga, Viñëu and Yajïa in Tretä-yuga, and Väsudeva and Saìkarñaëa in Dväpara-yuga, similar names are not given for Kali-yuga, although such names exist, in order to avoid disclosing cheaply the truth of the incarnation of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu.</div>
<div class="First"> In Kali-yuga human society is infested with hypocrisy and superficiality. There is a strong tendency toward imitation and fraud in this age. Therefore the incarnation of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu is revealed in Vedic literature in a confidential, discrete way, so that it will be known to the authorized persons who can then propagate the mission of the Lord on the earth. We actually see in this modern age that many foolish and ordinary persons claim to be God or incarnations, avatäras, etc. There are many cheap philosophies and academies that promise, for a moderate fee, to make one God in a short time. In America one famous religious group promises its followers that they will all become the Supreme Lord in heaven. Such bogus preaching goes on in the name of Christianity. Thus, were Caitanya Mahäprabhu's name widely spoken of in Vedic literature, there would soon be a veritable plague of imitation Caitanya Mahäprabhus infesting the world.</div>
<div class="First"> Therefore, to prevent this pandemonium, discretion is exercised in the Vedic literatures in Kali-yuga, and in a sober, concealed way the actual followers of Vedic culture are informed through the Vedic mantras of the descent of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. This discrete system, selected by the Lord Himself for His appearance in Kali-yuga, is proving to be greatly successful on the earth planet. And throughout the world millions of people are chanting the holy names of Kåñëa without the unbearable harassment of hundreds and thousands of imitation Caitanya Mahäprabhus. Those who seriously desire to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead can easily understand the Lord's mission, whereas cynical materialistic rascals, puffed up by false prestige and madly considering their insignificant intelligence to be greater than the intelligence of Lord Kåñëa, cannot understand the beautiful arrangements made by the Lord for His graceful descent into the material world. Thus, although Kåñëa is çreyasäm éçvaraù, or the Lord of all benedictions, such foolish persons turn away from the Lord's mission and in this way deprive themselves of their own true benefit in life.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Those who are actually advanced in knowledge are able to appreciate the essential value of this age of Kali. Such enlightened persons worship Kali-yuga because in this fallen age all perfection of life can easily be achieved by the performance of saìkértana.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> It is stated here that among the four ages—Satya, Tretä, Dväpara and Kali—Kali-yuga is actually the best because in this age the Lord mercifully distributes the highest perfection of consciousness, namely Kåñëa consciousness, very freely. The word ärya has been defined by Çréla Prabhupäda as "one who is advancing spiritually." The nature of an advanced person is to search for the essence of life. For example, the essence of the material body is not the body itself but the spirit soul that is within the body; therefore an intelligent person gives more attention to the eternal spirit soul than to the temporary body. Similarly, although Kali-yuga is considered to be an ocean of contamination, there is also an ocean of good fortune in Kali-yuga, namely the saìkértana movement. In other words, all of the degraded qualities of this age are completely counteracted by the process of chanting the holy names of the Lord. Thus it is stated in the Vedic language,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">dhyäyan kåte yajan yajïais</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tretäyäà dväpare 'rcayan</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yad äpnoti tad äpnoti</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kalau saìkértya keçavam</div>
<div class="First"> "Whatever is achieved in Satya-yuga by meditation, in Tretä by offering ritual sacrifices and in Dväpara by temple worship is achieved in Kali-yuga by chanting the names of Lord Keçava congregationally."</div>
<div class="First"> The Vedic process gradually lifts the conditioned entity out of the darkness of ahaìkära, or false identification with the gross material body, and brings him to the platform of self-realization, or ahaà brahmäsmi(95), "I am spirit soul. I am eternal." One has to make further progress to discover that although one is eternal, there is a superior eternal entity, who is the Lord Himself within one's own heart and within every atom in the material universe. Beyond this second phase of self-realization there is the third and final stage of perfection, which is realization of Bhagavän, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His own abode.</div>
<div class="First"> The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not primarily the superintendent of this world but rather the enjoyer of His own world, which is beyond the most fantastic dreams of the conditioned living entity. In other words, although the king or president of a country is ultimately the controller of the prison department, the king or president derives actual pleasure within his own palace and not in administering justice to the foolish prisoners. Similarly, the Lord appoints the demigods to administer the material creation on His behalf while He Himself personally enjoys the ocean of transcendental bliss in His own transcendental kingdom. Thus, realization of the Lord within His own kingdom is far superior to the primitive understanding that the Lord is the "creator" of the prison of the material world. This realization of Bhagavän begins with understanding that there are innumerable Vaikuëöha planets in the spiritual sky and that on each of them a particular expansion of Näräyaëa dwells with His innumerable devotees who are attached to that particular form. The central and chief planet in the spiritual sky is called Kåñëaloka, and there the Personality of Godhead exhibits His supreme and original form of Govinda. As confirmed by Lord Brahmä, govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi **. Lord Brahmä also states:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">anädir ädir govindaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sarva-käraëa-käraëam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">(Bs. 5.1)</div>
<div class="First"> Thus, love of Kåñëa and entrance into Kåñëa's planet in the spiritual sky is the most supremely perfect and exalted status of life available anywhere, at any time, throughout the totality of existence. That perfection is available in Kali-yuga simply by chanting the holy names of God: Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. Therefore every sane man, woman or child should deeply understand the unprecedented opportunity offered by Caitanya Mahäprabhu and seriously take up this chanting process. Only the most unfortunate and irrational person will neglect this transcendental opportunity.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Indeed, there is no higher possible gain for embodied souls forced to wander throughout the material world than the Supreme Lord's saìkértana movement, by which one can attain the supreme peace and free oneself from the cycle of repeated birth and death.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In the Skanda Puräëa, as well as in other Puräëas, there is the following statement: mahä-bhägavatä nityaà kalau kurvanti kértanam. "During Kali-yuga the great devotees of the Lord always engage in kértana, chanting the Lord's holy names." It is the nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be merciful, and He is especially merciful to those who, in a helpless condition, take complete shelter of His lotus feet. One can immediately take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord by chanting His holy names. According to Çrédhara Svämé, even in previous ages such as Satya-yuga it was not possible for the living entities to achieve the perfection that is available in Kali-yuga. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has explained this as follows. In former ages such as Satya-yuga human beings were perfectly qualified and easily performed even the most difficult spiritual processes, meditating for many thousands of years practically without eating or sleeping. Thus, although in any age one who completely takes shelter of the Lord's holy name gets all perfection, the highly qualified inhabitants of Satya-yuga do not consider that merely moving the tongue and lips, chanting the Lord's holy name, is a complete process and that the Lord's holy name is the only shelter within the universe. They are more attracted to the difficult and elaborate yoga system of meditation, complete with sophisticated sitting postures, painstaking control of the breath and deep, extended meditations in trance on the Personality of Godhead within the heart. In Satya-yuga sinful life is practically unheard of, and therefore people are not afflicted with the terrible reactions seen in Kali-yuga, such as world war, famine, plague, drought, insanity, etc. Although in Satya-yuga people always worship the Personality of Godhead as the ultimate goal of life and meticulously follow His laws, called dharma, they do not feel themselves to be in a helpless condition, and thus they do not always experience intense love for the Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> However, in Kali-yuga living conditions are so unbearable, modern governments are so obnoxious, our bodies are so ridden by physical and mental disease, and even self-preservation is so troublesome, that the conditioned souls intensely cry out the holy name of Kåñëa, begging for relief from the onslaught of this age. The members of the Kåñëa consciousness movement have vivid and unforgettable experiences of the terrible contradictions inherent in human society in this age, and thus they are firmly convinced that there is nothing to be achieved except the mercy of the Supreme Lord. In ISKCON centers throughout the world we observe wonderfully ecstatic kértana performances in which men, women and children from all walks of life chant with startling enthusiasm the holy names of Kåñëa and dance in ecstasy, becoming completely indifferent to so-called public opinion. In America a prominent professor from Oberlin College visited a Hare Kåñëa center in California and was astonished by the enthusiasm with which the devotees chant the holy name of Kåñëa in their congregational performances. Thus, due to their helpless and pathetic condition, the living entities in Kali-yuga have great impetus to surrender fully to the holy name of Kåñëa, putting all of their hope and faith in the Lord's holy name. Kali-yuga is therefore the best age because in this age, more than in Satya-yuga or other ages, the conditioned souls become disgusted with the kingdom of illusion and surrender fully to the Lord's holy name. This status of full surrender is called paramäà çäntim, or supreme peace.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted a passage from the book called Sväbhävya to the effect that a bona fide spiritual master in disciplic succession is able to understand the mentality and capability of his disciples and engage them in worshiping the particular form of the Lord suitable for them. In this way the spiritual master destroys all obstacles in the path of his disciples. The general rule is that one must worship the particular form of the Lord that appears in the current yuga. One may also offer his love and worship to other forms of the Lord that appear in other ages, and specifically one is recommended to chant the holy names of Lord Nåsiàhadeva to get all protection. Practically all of these injunctions are being carried out within the ISKCON movement. Within the Kåñëa consciousness society, men, women and children are all being engaged in worshiping the Lord according to their particular natures. In addition, according to Caitanya Mahäprabhu's order, we are worshiping Balaräma and Kåñëa, who appeared in Dväpara-yuga, because They are the original Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, by chanting the Daçävatära-stotra, jaya jagad-éça hare, and by reading Çrémad-Bhägavatam, the members of ISKCON worship all of the plenary expansions of the Personality of Godhead. And after every ärati performance devotional prayers are duly chanted to Lord Nåsiàhadeva for protection of this movement, which is so essential to human society.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear King, the inhabitants of Satya-yuga and other ages eagerly desire to take birth in this age of Kali, since in this age there will be many devotees of the Supreme Lord, Näräyaëa. These devotees will appear in various places but will be especially numerous in South India. O master of men, in the age of Kali those persons who drink the waters of the holy rivers of Draviòa-deça, such as the Tämraparëé, Krtamälä, Payasviné, the extremely pious Käveré and the Pratécé Mahänadé, will almost all be purehearted devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Väsudeva.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The Vedas contain information of past, present and future living conditions throughout the universe. This is not very wonderful. For example, although at present time in India we are experiencing spring weather, we know that in the future the torrid summer will come, followed by the rainy season, autumn and eventually winter and a new spring. Similarly, we know that these seasons have occurred repeatedly in the past. Thus, just as ordinary human beings can understand the past, present and future seasons of the earth, the liberated followers of Vedic culture can easily understand the past, present and future conditions of the seasonal ages of the earth and other planets. The inhabitants of Satya-yuga are certainly aware of the conditions of Kali-yuga. They know that in Kali-yuga the difficult material situation forces the living entity to take complete shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that the inhabitants of Kali-yuga therefore develop a high degree of love of Godhead. Therefore although the inhabitants of Satya-yuga are far more sinless, truthful and self-controlled than the people of other ages, they desire to take birth in Kali-yuga in order to taste pure love of Kåñëa.</div>
<div class="First"> Without associating with the devotees of the Lord no one can become an advanced devotee of the Lord. Therefore, since in Kali-yuga other Vedic processes collapse due to the unfavorable condition, and since the only authorized Vedic process is the devotional chanting of the Lord's holy name, which is available to everyone, there will undoubtedly be innumerable Vaiñëavas, or devotees of the Lord, in this age. Birth in this age is very favorable for one who is eager to associate with the devotees. In fact, the Kåñëa consciousness movement is establishing authorized Vaiñëava temples throughout the world so that in innumerable areas one may avail himself of association with pure Vaiñëavas.</div>
<div class="First"> Association with the devotees of the Lord is far more valuable than any amount of association with persons who are merely self-controlled, sinless or expert in Vedic scholarship. Therefore it is stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (6.14.5):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">muktänäm api siddhänäà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">näräyaëa-paräyaëaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">su-durlabhaù praçäntätmä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">koöiñv api mahä-mune</div>
<div class="First"> "O great sage, among many millions who are liberated and perfect in knowledge of liberation, one may be a devotee of Lord Näräyaëa, or Kåñëa. Such devotees, who are fully peaceful, are extremely rare." Similarly, it is stated in Caitanya-caritämåta (Madhya 22.54):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">'sädhu-saìga ', 'sädhu-saìga '-sarva-çästre kaya</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">lava-mätra sädhu-saìge sarva-siddhi haya</div>
<div class="First"> "The verdict of all revealed scriptures is that by even a moment's association with a pure devotee, one can attain all success."</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé the words kvacit kvacit in this verse indicate that in Kali-yuga Lord Çré Kåñëa Caitanya will appear in Gauòa-deça, in the district of Nadia. And from this pivotal point, He will gradually expand the flood of love of Godhead to cover the entire earth. Many exalted devotees such as Çré Advaitäcärya also take birth in Gauòa-deça. The process of chanting the holy name of Kåñëa, kåñëa-kértana, is not limited to Kali-yuga. In the Viñëu-dharma, in relation to the story of the fallen</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">son of a kñatriya, it is stated,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na deça-niyamas tatra</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na käla-niyamas tathä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nocchiñöädau niñedhaç ca</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">çré-harer nämni lubdhakaù</div>
<div class="First"> "There is no restriction of place or time, nor any injunction forbidding the accepting of remnants of foods, etc., when one has become greedy to chant the name of Çré Hari." Similarly, it is stated in the Skanda Puräëa, the Viñëu-dharma and the Vaiçäkha-mähätmya section of the Padma Puräëa, cakräyudhasya nämäni sadä sarvatra kértayet: "The names of the Supreme Lord who has the disc as His weapon should be glorified always and everywhere."</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">Similarly, the Skanda Puräëa states,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na deça-kälävasthätmaçuddhy-</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ädikam apekñate</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kintu svatantram evaitaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">näma kämita-käma-dam</div>
<div class="First"> "The name of the Lord need not be chanted with regard to place, time, circumstantial conditions, preliminary self-purification or any other factors. Rather, it is completely independent of all other processes and rewards all the desires of those who eagerly chant it." Similarly, it is stated in the</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">Viñëu-dharma,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kalau kåta-yugaà tasya</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kalis tasya kåte yuge</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yasya cetasi govindo</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">hådaye yasya näcyutaù</div>
<div class="First"> "For one who has Lord Govinda in his heart, Satya-yuga becomes manifest in the midst of Kali, and conversely even Satya-yuga becomes Kali-yuga for one who does not have the infallible Lord in his heart." The holy name of Kåñëa is potent everywhere, at all times and in all circumstances; therefore one should always chant the holy names of the Lord, either in Kali-yuga, Satya-yuga, in heaven, in hell or in Vaikuëöha. Kåñëa's holy name is eternally nondifferent from Him, and Kåñëa is eternally the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus, it is not that the holy name is powerful in this age only because other processes are not effective.</div>
<div class="First"> It is also stated in the Çré Viñëu Puräëa that chanting the holy names of the Lord is far more potent than simply trying to remember the Lord through meditation. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam (2.1.11), Çukadeva Gosvämé has stated,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">etan nirvidyamänänäm</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">icchatäm akuto-bhayam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yoginäà nåpa nirëétaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">harer nämänukértanam</div>
<div class="First"> "O King, constant chanting of the holy name of the Lord after the ways of the great authorities is the doubtless and fearless way of success for all, including those who are free from all material desires, those who are desirous of all material enjoyment, and also those who are self-satisfied by dint of transcendental knowledge." In his commentary on this verse in the Bhägavatam, Çréla Prabhupäda has written: "According to Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé, this way of attaining success [chanting the holy name] is an established fact, concluded not only by him, but also by all other previous äcäryas. Therefore there is no need of further evidence." The reader may consult Çréla Prabhupäda's purport to this verse for a detailed explanation of the chanting of the holy name of the Lord and the offenses to be avoided in such chanting.</div>
<div class="First"> In the Vaiñëava-cintämaëi there is the following statement:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">agha-cchit smaraëaà viñëor</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bahv-äyäsena sädhyate</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">oñöha-spandana-mätreëa</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kértanaà tu tato varam</div>
<div class="First"> "Although capable of destroying all sins, the remembrance of Lord Viñëu is achieved only with extraordinary effort. On the other hand, one may perform kåñëa-kértana simply by moving one's lips, and thus this process is superior." Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has also quoted the following verse:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yena janma-çataiù pürvaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">väsudevaù samärcitaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tan-mukhe hari-nämäni</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sadä tiñöhanti bhärata</div>
<div class="First"> "O descendant of Bharata, the holy names of Lord Viñëu are always vibrating in the mouth of one who has previously worshiped Väsudeva perfectly for hundreds of lifetimes." The same idea is conveyed in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam by Çrématé Devahüti in her statement to her son, Kapila:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">aho bata çva-paco 'to garéyän</div>

<div class="First"> "Oh, how glorious are they whose tongues are chanting Your holy name! Even if born in the families of dog-eaters, such persons are worshipable. Persons who chant the holy name of Your Lordship must have executed all kinds of austerities and fire sacrifices and achieved all the good manners of the Aryans. To be chanting the holy name of Your Lordship, they must have bathed at holy places of pilgrimage, studied the Vedas and fulfilled everything required." (SB 3.33.7)</div>
<div class="First"> Therefore, Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has concluded that it is possible to perform kértana equally in all ages. In Kali-yuga, however, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by His causeless mercy, personally induces the living entities to take the holy name. Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura has thus quoted the Lord as follows:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">enechi auñadhi mäyä näçibära lägi'</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">hari-näma mahä-mantra lao tumi mägi'</div>
<div class="First"> "O conditioned souls who are foolishly sleeping on the lap of the witch Mäyä, I have brought an excellent medicine to cure the disease of your illusion. This medicine is called hari-näma. It is My holy name, and by taking this medicine you will get all perfection in life. Therefore, I sincerely request you to please take this medicine that I have personally brought for you." In verse 32 of this chapter it was stated, yajïaiù saìkértana-präyair yajanti hi su-medhasaù. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé the words saìkértana-präyaiù, which mean "mainly by the process of saìkértana," indicate that although other processes such as Deity worship may be performed to some extent in Kali-yuga, such processes, in order to be successful, must be favorably connected with the chanting of the holy names of the Lord. One who is performing worship of the Kåñëa Deity should know that the most essential part of such Deity worship is constant chanting of the holy names of the Lord. On the other hand, one who has perfectly chanted the holy name of the Lord need not depend on other processes, as expressed in the following famous mantra:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">harer näma harer näma</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">harer nämaiva kevalam</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">[Cc. Ädi 17.21]</div>
<div class="First"> "In this age of Kali there is no alternative, there is no alternative, there is no alternative for spiritual progress other than the holy name, the holy name, the holy name of the Lord." (Båhan-näradéya Puräëa 38.126) As proved by all of these evidences, the statement in the Bhägavatam (kalià sabhäjayanty äryäù) that spiritually advanced persons worship the age of Kali due to the facilities offered in this age by the Lord is not at all contradictory. At the end of verse 40 in this chapter it is stated, präyo bhaktä bhagavati väsudeve 'maläçayäù: in general those who are able to regularly drink the waters of the holy rivers of South India will be pure-hearted devotees of Lord Väsudeva. The word präyaù, or "in general" indicates that those who are offensive to the Lord's devotees, although claiming themselves to be devotees, are not included within the list of amaläçayäù, or purehearted souls. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has pointed out that one should not be bewildered by seeing the apparently poverty-stricken condition of the inhabitants of South India. Even nowadays the inhabitants of the places mentioned in this verse generally spend their days with meager eating and clothing and live as great renounced devotees of the Supreme Lord. In other words, clothes do not make the man. To live as a polished animal, dressing oneself luxuriously and gratifying the tongue with rich foodstuffs, is not the actual symptom of an advanced transcendentalist. Although the residents of South India are generally Çré Vaiñëavas, or devotees in the Lakñmé-sampradäya, they are recognized as devotees of the Lord by the followers of Caitanya Mahäprabhu. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, their austere living conditions should be taken as a good qualification, not a disqualification.</div>

<div class="Translation"> O King, one who has given up all material duties and has taken full shelter of the lotus feet of Mukunda, who offers shelter to all, is not indebted to the demigods, great sages, ordinary living beings, relatives, friends, mankind or even one's forefathers who have passed away. Since all such classes of living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, one who has surrendered to the Lord's service has no need to serve such persons separately.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> One who has not fully surrendered to the devotional service of the Lord undoubtedly has many material duties to perform. Every ordinary conditioned soul is the recipient of innumerable benefits given by the demigods, who provide sun and moonshine, rain, wind, food and, ultimately, one's own material body. In Bhagavad-gétä it is stated, stena eva saù: [Bg. 3.12] one who does not reciprocate with the demigods by offering them sacrifice is stena, or a thief. Similarly, other living entities such as cows are providing us with innumerable delicious and nutritious foodstuffs. When we wake up in the morning our mind is refreshed by the sweet singing of birds, and on a hot day we enjoy the cool shade and breeze of the forest trees. We are accepting service from innumerable living entities, and we are obligated to repay them. Äpta means one's own family members, to whom one is certainly obligated according to normal morality, and nåëäm means human society. Until one becomes a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is certainly a product of his society. We receive mundane education, culture, tradition and protection from the society in which we live, and thus we owe a great debt to society. Of course, our debt to society is not simply to the present order but to all of our forefathers and ancestors who carefully preserved moral and social customs so that we, their descendants, could live peacefully. Therefore the word pitèëäm, or "forefathers," indicates our debt to previous generations. In fact, the members of the Kåñëa consciousness society are sometimes criticized by materialistic persons for giving too much attention to Kåñëa rather than working to fulfill all of the above-mentioned obligations. In reply to this, the Bhägavatam (4.31.14) states, yathä taror müla-niñecanena tåpyanti tat-skandha-bhujopaçäkhäù. If one waters the root of a tee, automatically all of the branches, twigs, leaves, etc., are also nourished. There is no need for, nor any effectiveness in, separately pouring water on the branches, twigs and leaves of a tree. The water has to be placed on the root. Similarly, präëopahäräc ca yathendriyäëäm: food must be placed in the stomach, from where it is automatically distributed to all of the limbs of the body. It is foolish to try to nourish the whole body by rubbing food separately on all the bodily limbs. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is the source of all existence. Everything is emanating from Kåñëa, everything is maintained by Kåñëa, and at the end, everything will merge to rest in Kåñëa. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is the supreme benefactor, friend, protector and well-wisher of every living entity, and if He is satisfied, then automatically the whole world will become satisfied, just as all of the bodily limbs are strengthened and satisfied when food is duly remitted to the stomach. The example can be given that a man who is working as the personal secretary to a great king has no further obligation to petty minor kings. Undoubtedly an ordinary person has many obligations within this material world. But according to Bhagavad-gétä, mayaiva vihitän hi tän: it is actually the Supreme Lord who is giving all benedictions. For example, one receives one's body by the mercy of one's parents. However, sometimes we find that a particular man or woman may become impotent at a given moment. Sometimes a deformed child is born, and sometimes a child is born dead. Often the sexual act fails to produce pregnancy at all. So although all parents desire a beautiful, highly qualified child, this is often not the case. Thus it can be understood that ultimately it is by the mercy of the Supreme Lord that a man and woman are able to produce a child by the sexual act. It is by the Lord's mercy that the man's seminal injection is potent and the woman's ovum is fertile. Similarly, it is only by the mercy of the Lord that the child is born in a healthy condition and reaches physical maturity to pursue his own life. If at any stage in the evolution of a human being the Lord's mercy is withdrawn, sudden death or crippling disease occurs.</div>
<div class="First"> The demigods are also not independent. The words parihåtya kartam, "giving up other duties," indicate that one should give up any concept that the demigods are separate from Kåñëa. It is clearly stated in Vedic literature that the demigods are different limbs of the universal body of the Supreme Lord. Further, it is stated in Bhagavad-gétä that the Supreme Lord is situated in everyone's heart and that He only is giving intelligence and memory. Thus, our forefathers who carefully preserved cultural traditions were acting with intelligence provided by the Supreme Lord. They certainly were not acting with their own independent intelligence. No one can be intelligent without a brain, and it is only by Kåñëa's mercy that we receive a human brain. Therefore, if we carefully analyze all of our multifarious obligations toward different classes of living entities, we shall find that in each and every case it is ultimately by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that we have received a particular benediction in life. So although an ordinary person must methodically fulfill all of his various obligations by executing different types of sacrifices and charitable activities for the satisfaction of those who have benefited him, one who is directly serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, at once fulfills all such obligations because all benedictions ultimately have come from the Lord through the agency of family, forefathers, demigods, etc.</div>
<div class="First"> The example may be given that sometimes a state government may distribute benefits originally provided by the federal government. So one who becomes the personal secretary or minister to the chief executive of the federal government has no further obligation to the less important representatives of the state government. Therefore, it is stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (11.20.9):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tävat karmäëi kurvéta</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na nirvidyeta yävatä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mat-kathä-çravaëädau vä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">çraddhä yävan na jäyate</div>
<div class="First"> "As long as one is not satiated by fruitive activity and has not awakened his taste for devotional service by hearing and chanting about the Supreme Lord, one has to act according to the regulative principles of the Vedic injunctions." The conclusion is that one who has fully surrendered to the devotional service of the Supreme Lord is a first-class human being.</div>
<div class="First"> People in general are only eager to receive benedictions from demigods, family members and society because such benedictions are conducive to material sense gratification. Less intelligent persons consider such material progress to be the only goal of life and thus cannot appreciate the exalted position of pure devotional service to the Lord. Bhakti-yoga, or pure devotional service, is meant to directly please the senses of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Envious materialistic persons propose various arguments to deny that the Supreme Lord even has transcendental senses. The devotees, however, do not waste!time doubting the inconceivable beauty, strength, wealth and geniality of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but directly please the Lord's senses through loving service and thus receive the supreme benediction of going back home, back to Godhead. The devotees return to the Lord's abode, where life is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge. No demigod, family member or forefather can give one an eternal life of bliss and knowledge. However, if one foolishly neglects the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord and instead accepts the temporary material body to be everything, then one must certainly perform elaborate sacrifices, austerities and charity and fulfill all of the obligations mentioned above. Otherwise, one becomes completely sinful and condemned, even from the material point of view.</div>

<div class="Translation"> One who has thus given up all other engagements and has taken full shelter at the lotus feet of Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is very dear to the Lord. Indeed, if such a surrendered soul accidentally commits some sinful activity, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is seated within everyone's heart, immediately takes away the reaction to such sin.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In the previous verse it was clearly described that a fully surrendered devotee of the Supreme Lord has no need to perform ordinary, worldly duties. Now in this verse it is revealed that devotional service is so pure and potent that a surrendered devotee of the Lord has no need to perform any other purificatory process. As described in the Sixth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, a surrendered devotee has no need to perform präyaçcitta, or atonement for an accidental falldown into sinful activity. Since devotional service is itself the most purifying process, a sincere devotee who has accidentally stumbled on the path should immediately resume his pure devotional service at the lotus feet of the Lord. And thus the Lord will protect him, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä (9.30):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">api cet su-duräcäro</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhajate mäm ananya-bhäk</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sädhur eva sa mantavyaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">samyag vyavasito hi saù</div>
<div class="First"> The word tyaktänya-bhävasya in this verse is very significant. As stated in the previous verse, a pure devotee realizes clearly that all living entities, including Brahmä and Çiva, are part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus have no separate or independent existence. Realizing that everything and everyone is part and parcel of the Lord, a devotee automatically is not inclined to commit sinful activities by violating the order of God. However, due to the powerful influence of material nature, even a sincere devotee may be temporarily overwhelmed by illusion and deviate from the rigid path of pure devotional service. In such a case, Lord Kåñëa Himself, acting within the heart, removes such sinful activities. Even Yamaräja, the lord of death, has no power to punish a surrendered devotee who has accidentally committed sinful activities. As stated here, Kåñëa is pareça, or the Supreme Lord, and all secondary lords such as the demigods cannot threaten the Lord's personal devotees. In his youth Ajämila had been a pious brähmaëa engaged in the service of the Lord. Then, by bad association with a prostitute, he became practically the most degraded man in the world. At the end of his life, Yamaräja sent his Yamadütas to drag away the soul of the sinful Ajämila, but the Personality of Godhead immediately sent His personal associates to save Ajämila and demonstrate to Yamaräja that no secondary personality can disturb the personal devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, kaunteya pratijänéhi na me bhaktaù praëaçyati [Bg. 9.31].</div>
<div class="First"> The argument may be raised that the småti-çästra states, çruti-småti mamaiväjïe: the Vedic scriptures are the direct orders of the Personality of Godhead. Therefore, one may ask, how can the Lord tolerate that His orders be occasionally neglected, even by His devotees? To answer this possible objection, the word priyasya is used in this verse. The devotees of the Lord are very dear to the Lord. Although the beloved child may accidentally commit an abominable activity, the loving father forgives the child, taking into consideration the actual good intentions of the child. Thus, although the devotee of the Lord does not try to exploit the Lord's mercy by requesting the Lord to free him from any future suffering, the Lord, by His own initiative, frees the devotee from the reactions to accidental falldowns. This causeless mercy of the Lord upon His devotee is His paramaiçvaryam, or supreme opulence. Gradually the faithful devotee becomes free, even from accidental falldown, because simply by remembering the lotus feet of the Lord, what to speak of by actively rendering service to Him, his heart is purified. Although the surrendered devotees of the Personality of Godhead may sometimes appear to be affected by mundane attitudes, they are inevitably protected by the merciful Lord and are never actually defeated in life.</div>

<div class="First"> Närada Muni related to Kåñëa's father, Vasudeva, the story of the enlightenment of King Nimi. Now Närada reveals that Vasudeva himself will also achieve the supreme perfection of life by practicing the same principles spoken long ago by the nine Yogendras. Actually, Vasudeva was already a personal associate of the Supreme Lord, but due to his natural humility as a great devotee, he was determined to perfect his love of Kåñëa. Thus we can observe the exalted status of the parents of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="First"> Ordinary persons feel that the Supreme Lord is always to be worshiped as the supreme father who supplies everything for the living entities. Such an attitude is not the perfection of love of Godhead, because when a son is young he is incapable of giving much service to his mother and father. When the child is very young, it is rather the parents who are constantly serving the child. So when the devotee takes the role of mother or father of Kåñëa, there is unlimited opportunity for rendering loving service to the Lord, whom the devotee ecstatically accepts as his son. It was Vasudeva's good fortune that Närada Muni personally revealed to him the wonderful teachings given by the nava-yogendras long, long ago to the saintly King Nimi.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear Vasudeva, you and your good wife Devaké have manifested great transcendental love for Kåñëa, accepting Him as your son. Indeed, you are always seeing the Lord, embracing Him, speaking with Him, resting with Him, sitting together with Him and taking your meals with Him. By such affectionate and intimate association with the Lord, undoubtedly both of you have completely purified your hearts. In other words, you are already perfect.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The words ätmä väm pävitaù in this verse are very significant. Ordinary conditioned souls are required to purify their existence by practicing the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga and learning how to offer all of their activities in the devotional service of the Lord. Such a regulative, gradual process, however, cannot be applied to those exalted souls who are personally attending the Lord as His parents, boyfriends, girl friends, advisors, sons, etc. Due to Vasudeva and Devaké's intense love for Kåñëa as their son, they had already achieved the highest perfectional stage of life. Although in the previous verse Çré Närada Muni informed Vasudeva that he and his wife had become glorious by Kåñëa's taking birth as their son, Vasudeva might have argued that other personal associates of the Lord, such as Jaya and Vijaya, had fallen down due to offending the brähmaëa class. Therefore, in the present verse Närada has used the word pävitaù: "You are completely purified, and therefore you are completely free from the slightest trace of discrepancy in your devotional service, due to your intense love for Kåñëa." It is understood from the commentary of Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura that Çré Vasudeva, Kåñëa's pastime father, is actually an eternally liberated nitya-siddha associate of the Personality of Godhead. Vasudeva has a spiritual body, just as Kåñëa does, and he is always merged in the overwhelming ecstatic desire to serve Kåñëa, his beautiful son. However, Närada could understand that due to extreme humility, Vasudeva considered himself an ordinary human being and was feeling very anxious to receive transcendental instructions on the devotional service of the Lord. Accepting the ecstatic humility of Vasudeva, and to relieve his anxiety, Çré Närada Muni instructed him in the science of bhakti-yoga as one might instruct an ordinary human being. However, at the some time Närada has revealed that actually Çré Vasudeva and Devaké are already completely glorious by their unprecedented fortune of having Kåñëa and Balaräma as their sons. Therefore, Närada is telling Vasudeva, "My dear Vasudeva, do not in any way be discouraged or doubtful about your position. Undoubtedly you are immediately going back home, back to Godhead. And actually you and your good wife are the most fortunate persons."</div>
<div class="First"> In conclusion, everyone should become fortunate by fully developing his dormant love for Kåñëa. Many terrible demons who opposed Kåñëa eventually achieved a happy state of life by their association with Kåñëa. Therefore there is no doubt about the supreme bliss achieved by the loving devotees of the Lord who day and night can only think of pleasing Kåñëa.</div>

Being thus always absorbed in Kåñëa, they achieved spiritual liberation in the Lord's own abode. What then can be said of the benedictions offered to those who constantly fix their minds on Lord Kåñëa in a favorable, loving mood?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> On the eve of the disappearance of Lord Kåñëa from this world, Vasudeva became filled with lamentation thinking that he had not properly utilized the opportunity of the Lord's personal presence to become perfectly Kåñëa conscious. However, Närada Muni assured Çré Vasudeva that the glories of Vasudeva and his good wife Devaké were chanted throughout the universe because even the demigods worshiped the exalted status of the Lord's own parents. Vasudeva was not only concerned about his own spiritual position, but he also lamented for the Yadu dynasty, which had left the world in an apparently inauspicious way, being cursed by great brähmaëas such as Närada and dying in a fratricidal war. Although the members of the Yadu dynasty were personal associates of the Lord, their disappearance from the earth was apparently inauspicious, and therefore Vasudeva was concerned about their eventual destination. So Närada here assures Vasudeva that even the demons who opposed Kåñëa, such as Çiçupäla, Pauëòraka and Çälva, achieved promotion to the Lord's own abode because of their constant absorption in thinking of Kåñëa. Therefore what to speak of the exalted members of the Yadu dynasty who actually loved Kåñëa more than anything (anurakta-dhiyäm punaù kim)? Similarly, it is stated in the Garuòa Puräëa,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ajïäninaù sura-varaà samadhikñipanto</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yaà päpino 'pi çiçupäla-suyodhanädyäù</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">kaù saàçayaù parama-bhaktimatäà janänäm</div>
<div class="First"> "Even foolish sinners like Çiçupäla and Duryodhana who showered abuse upon the Lord were cleansed of all sins simply by remembering Lord Kåñëa. Somehow or other their minds were absorbed in the Lord, and thus they attained liberation. What doubt then is there about the destination of those who are overwhelmed with devotional feelings for the Lord?" Vasudeva was also feeling anxiety because on the one hand he was aware that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but at the same time he treated the Lord as his beloved son. In the relationship between the father and son, sometimes the father must chastise the son and restrict him in various ways. In this way Vasudeva was feeling that undoubtedly he had offended the Lord in his attempt to train Lord Kåñëa as his son. However, Lord Kåñëa is actually pleased when a pure devotee becomes absorbed in parental love for Him and thus devotedly tries to care for Him just as loving parents care for a small child. Kåñëa reciprocates the intense devotional feelings of such devotees by actually appearing before them as a young boy and acting just like their son. As mentioned in this verse, the demons actually chastised Kåñëa with feelings of enmity. Nevertheless, such demons attained liberation due to their absorption in Kåñëa. Therefore, what to speak of the destination of Vasudeva, who chastised Kåñëa due to his overwhelming parental love for Him? The conclusion is that the devotees of the Lord should never consider Vasudeva and Devaké to be ordinary, conditioned souls. Their relationship with Lord Kåñëa is completely on the transcendental platform of vätsalya-rasa, or parental love for the Personality of Godhead. It has nothing to do with the parental love of the material world, which is based on a mood of sense gratification, since the parents see their children as objects of material enjoyment.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Do not think of Kåñëa as an ordinary child, because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, inexhaustible and the Soul of all beings. The Lord has concealed His inconceivable opulences and is thus outwardly appearing to be an ordinary human being.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Çré Kåñëa is the original source of all plenary incarnations of the Absolute Truth. Kåñëas tu bhagavän svayam [SB 1.3.28]. His unlimited transcendental opulences are inexhaustible, and thus He very easily brings the entire creation under His personal control. Lord Kåñëa is the eternal well-wisher of every living entity, so there was no need for Vasudeva to be anxious about his future destination, nor that of the other personal associates of Kåñëa, such as the members of the Yadu dynasty. In verse 46 of this chapter, Närada Muni told Vasudeva, putratäm agamad yad väà bhagavän éçvaro hariù: "You and your good wife are now glorified throughout the universe because Lord Kåñëa has personally become your son." In this way Närada is encouraging Vasudeva to continue to love Kåñëa as his most beloved son, for such ecstatic devotional feelings are never to be given up. But at the same time, Närada is removing Vasudeva's doubts about the future by assuring him, "Due to your love for Kåñëa you may think that He is an ordinary human being. You are appearing like a human being, and Lord Kåñëa is simply reciprocating with you. In order to encourage you to love Him as your son, He is placing Himself under your control. And thus, His inconceivable power and opulences are being concealed from you. Don't assume, however, that there is actually a dangerous situation because of the events of this material world. Although Kåñëa appears to be under your control, He is eternally the supreme controller. Therefore, do not consider Him to be a human being. He is always the Supreme Personality of Godhead."</div>
<div class="First"> The word mäyä in this verse indicates that Kåñëa's manuñya, or humanlike, activities are actually misleading to the ordinary man because Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Mäyä also means "transcendental potencies." As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, sambhavämy ätma-mäyayä: [Bg. 4.6] the Lord descends in His own transcendental form filled with transcendental potencies. And thus the words mäyä-manuñya-bhävena here also indicate Kåñëa's original transcendental form, which resembles the humanlike forms experienced in this world. Mäyä also indicates "mercy," or "compassion," according to the Sanskrit dictionary, and thus the Lord's incarnation is understood to be His causeless mercy upon the conditioned souls. The Lord's descent is also His causeless mercy upon the liberated souls, who take immense pleasure in joining the Lord in His pastimes and in chanting and hearing about such exalted spiritual activities (çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù [SB 7.5.23]). In order to reciprocate the love of Vasudeva for Him, Kåñëa mostly concealed His unlimited opulences. In this way the devotee is fully encouraged in his particular loving relationship with the Lord. However, when Vasudeva was filled with anxiety due to the dangerous situation created by the brähmaëa's curse, Närada immediately reminded him that such anxiety was unnecessary, since all these events were under the direct control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus, the Vaiñëava paramahaàsas who take the position of the Lord's parents remain under the shelter of the Lord at all times and never deviate from the loving devotional service of the Lord. They remain fixed in transcendence in all circumstances, unlike ordinary parents of the material world, who are constantly becoming bewildered by illusion due to the bodily concept of life.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The Supreme Personality of Godhead descended to kill the demoniac kings who were the burden of the earth and to protect the saintly devotees. However, both the demons and the devotees are awarded liberation by the Lord's mercy. Thus, His transcendental fame has spread throughout the universe.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> A doubt may arise as to how the Supreme Personality of Godhead descends to this material world. And since He is the omnipotent creator of millions of universes, why do the devotees glorify as wonderful the Lord's activities such as His killing a witch named Pütanä by sucking out her life through her breast? Although such activities are certainly beyond the scope of ordinary human beings, why should they be considered wonderful when executed by the omnipotent Personality of Godhead? The answer is given in this verse by the word nirvåtyai The Lord killed the demons not because He was envious of them, but in order to give them spiritual liberation. Thus the causeless mercy of the Personality of Godhead in liberating both the devotees and the demons by His inconceivable pastimes clearly distinguishes the Lord from any other living entity, either man or demigod. It is stated, mukti-pradätä sarveñäà viñëur eva na saàçayaù: only Viñëu can give liberation beyond birth and death. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has pointed out that generally the demons are awarded impersonal liberation in the Brahman effulgence, whereas the devotees are given the superior benediction of love of Godhead in the spiritual planets. Thus, the Lord exhibits His causeless mercy toward all classes of living entities, and His fame is spread throughout the universe. Because Kåñëa is transcendental, His fame is not different from His personal incarnation, so as the Lord's fame expands, the entire universe is gradually liberated. These are some of the unique characteristics of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Anyone who meditates on this pious historical narration with fixed attention will purify himself of all contamination in this very life and thus achieve the highest spiritual perfection. Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Fifth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Närada Concludes His Teachings to Vasudeva."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 6. The Yadu Dynasty Retires to Prabhäsa</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter describes how Brahmä and other demigods, after offering prayers to Lord Çré Kåñëa, requested the Lord to return to His own abode and how Uddhava, anticipating separation from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was very distressed and prayed to Çré Kåñëa that he might accompany Him on His return to that abode.</div>
<div class="First"> Desiring to see Çré Kåñëa in His humanlike form, which enchants all the worlds, the Gandharvas, Apsaräs, Nägas, Åñis, Pitäs, Vidyädharas, Kinnaras and other demigods, all headed by Brahmä, Çiva and Indra, arrived at the city of Dvärakä. Covering the body of Kåñëa with flower garlands from the Nandana gardens of heaven, they praised Him with statements about His transcendental power and qualities.</div>
<div class="First"> All living entities, beginning with Brahmä, are subordinate to Lord Çré Kåñëa. Kåñëa creates the universe by empowering His expansion Mahä-Viñëu. Although Kåñëa creates, maintains and destroys this world through His material energy, He remains transcendental to the material energy and perfectly self-satisfied. Even in the midst of His sixteen thousand queens, Lord Kåñëa is undisturbed.</div>
<div class="First"> Performers of fruitive sacrifices and yogés desiring mystic power contemplate the lotus feet of Lord Çré Kåñëa to attain their materialistic objectives. But the most elevated devotees, who desire liberation from the bondage of material work, lovingly contemplate the Lord's lotuslike feet because those feet are the fire that destroys all desires for sense gratification. One cannot actually purify the mind by ordinary worship, penance and other such processes. One can purify the mind contaminated by sense gratification only through mature faith in the mode of goodness, which arises by hearing the glories of Kåñëa. Therefore, intelligent persons situated in the varëäçrama system serve the two kinds of holy places: the nectarean rivers of the topics of Kåñëa and the nectarean rivers flowing from the Lord's lotus feet. By incarnating within the Yadu dynasty, Kåñëa performed the highest welfare work for the entire universe by displaying His transcendental pastimes. Simply by hearing and chanting about these pastimes, pious persons in Kali-yuga can definitely cross over the ocean of material illusion. When the Lord had fulfilled the purpose of His descent and the Yadu dynasty was facing imminent destruction from the brähmaëas' curse, the Lord desired to wind up His pastimes. When Brahmä prayed to the lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa for the deliverance of himself and all the other demigods, Çré Kåñëa revealed in His reply that after the destruction of the Yadu dynasty He would return to His own abode.</div>
<div class="First"> Observing terrible disturbances indicating the imminent destruction of the world, Lord Kåñëa called together the wise members of the Yadu dynasty and reminded them of the brähmaëas' curse. The Lord convinced them to go to Prabhäsa-tértha, where they could save themselves by the performance of ritual bathing, charity, and so on. The Yadus, in obedience to Kåñëa's desire, prepared to journey to Prabhäsa.</div>
<div class="First"> Upon seeing and hearing the Lord's conversation with the Yadu dynasty, Uddhava approached Lord Çré Kåñëa in a secluded place, offered Him full obeisances and, with folded hands, expressed his inability to tolerate separation from the Lord. He begged Kåñëa to carry him to His own abode. If one tastes the nectar of Kåñëa's pastimes with his ears, one loses all hankering for other things. Persons who engage constantly in Kåñëa's service-while eating, sporting, sleeping, sitting, etc.-cannot tolerate separation from Kåñëa. They honor all kinds of remnants from Çré Kåñëa and thus conquer the Lord's illusory energy. Peaceful members of the renounced order attain Brahmaloka after exhaustive and painful exertion, whereas the devotees of the Lord simply discuss Lord Kåñëa among themselves, chant and remember His various pastimes and instructions, and thus automatically cross beyond the insurmountable material energy.</div>

The ultimate cause of the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the material world is certainly inconceivable even for the greatest mundane scientists, who waste their lives in useless and fruitless speculation. Yet Mahä-Viñëu, who is the secondary expansion of an expansion of the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, sees the entire cosmos to be like an insignificant atom. So what hope is there for foolish so-called scientists who try to understand Kåñëa by their ridiculous experimental power? Thus the word anavadya is used. No one can find fault or discrepancy in the body, character, activities or instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is never materially ignorant; therefore He never exhibits cruelty, laziness, foolishness, blindness or material intoxication. Similarly, because the Lord is never polluted by material passion, He never exhibits material pride, lamentation, yearning or violence. And since the Lord is free from material goodness, He never attempts to peacefully enjoy the material world with a sublime materialistic mentality.</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa, as stated here (sve sukhe 'vyavahite 'bhirataù), is eternally busy, day and night, in His transcendental abode, relishing the inconceivable loving devotion of His innumerable associates. The Lord is being embraced and is embracing. He is joking and is hearing the joking of His loved ones. The Lord is walking through forests full of fruits and flowers, playing in the nectarean river Yamunä and taking part in His most confidential transcendental loving affairs with the cowherd girls of Våndävana. These pastimes in Kåñëaloka and on other Vaikuëöha planets are eternal, faultless and an ocean of spiritual happiness. The Lord never descends to the dry platform of relative material happiness. The infinite Personality of Godhead bas nothing to gain from anyone; thus fruitive activity cannot possibly exist within the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> O greatest of all, those whose consciousness is polluted by illusion cannot purify themselves merely by ordinary worship, study of the Vedas, charity, austerity and ritual activities. Our Lord, those pure souls who have developed a powerful transcendental faith in Your glories achieve a purified state of existence that can never be attained by those lacking such faith.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Even if a pure devotee is lacking the above qualifications, such as Vedic study and austerity, if he has unflinching faith in Lord Kåñëa the Lord will save him because of his devotion. On the other hand, if one becomes falsely proud of one's material qualifications, including ordinary piety, but does not devote himself to hearing and chanting the glories of Kåñëa, the result will ultimately be nil. The transcendental spirit soul cannot be purified by any amount of material piety, charity or scholarship. Only the transcendental Supreme Lord can purify the transcendental living entity by bestowing His mercy within the heart. The demigods were astonished at their good fortune. Even by hearing about Kåñëa, one achieves all perfection, but they had entered the Lord's own city and were seeing Him standing before them,</div>

<div class="Translation"> Great sages, desiring the highest benefit in life, always cherish Your lotus feet within their hearts, which are melted by love for You. Similarly, Your self-controlled devotees, desiring to cross beyond the material kingdom of heaven to achieve opulence equal to Yours, worship Your lotus feet in the morning, at noon and in the evening. Thus, they meditate upon Your Lordship in Your quadruple expansion.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The conditioned living entity can purify his existence simply by having firm faith in the transcendental glories of the Personality of Godhead. What then can be said of the extraordinary good fortune of the demigods, who were directly seeing Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet? Although we are presently afflicted by innumerable material desires, these desires are temporary. The eternal living entity is meant to experience a loving relationship with the supreme living entity, the Personality of Godhead; and by rendering pure devotional service to the Lord, the heart of the living entity is completely satisfied. The word dhümaketu in this verse indicates a flaming comet or fire, which represents Lord Çiva. Lord Çiva is the master of the mode of ignorance, and Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet are compared to the comet, a symbol of the potency of Çiva, which can destroy all ignorance within the heart. The word sama-vibhütaye ("for achieving equal opulence") indicates that the pure devotees go back home, back to Godhead, and enjoy the infinite bliss of the spiritual world. Lord Kåñëa is endowed with unlimited opulent paraphernalia for enjoyment, and a liberated soul who goes to Kåñëa's abode is awarded all opulence for serving the Lord. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, the word vyühe in this verse indicates the three puruña incarnations, namely Mahä-Viñëu, Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu and Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, as well as Väsudeva. If we can scientifically understand how Kåñëa expands Himself to create the material world, we shall immediately experience that everything is the property of Kåñëa and thus become free from the desire to exploit it for our own selfish purposes. Kåñëa is the Supreme Lord, the master of everyone and the reservoir of all opulences, and one should remember His lotus feet in the morning, at noon and in the evening. One who always remembers Kåñëa and never forgets Him will experience real, blissful life beyond the pale shadow of material illusion.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Those about to offer oblations into the fire of sacrifice in accordance with the Åg, Yajur and Säma Vedas meditate on Your lotus feet. Similarly, the practitioners of transcendental yoga meditate upon Your lotus feet, hoping for knowledge about Your divine mystic potency, and the most elevated pure devotees perfectly worship Your lotus feet, desiring to cross beyond Your illusory potency.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The words ätma-mäyäà jijïäsubhiù are significant in this verse. The mystic yogés (adhyätma-yoga uta yogibhiù) are eager to acquire knowledge of the Lord's mystic potencies, whereas the pure devotees (parama-bhägavataiù) are eager to cross beyond the kingdom of illusion so that they can serve Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet in pure loving ecstasy. In any case, everyone is interested in the potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The atheistic material scientists are also fascinated by the external material potency of the Lord, and the gross sense gratifiers are attracted by the physical body, which is also ätma-mäyä, or an expansion of the Lord's potency. Although all of the Lord's potencies are qualitatively one with the Lord, and therefore with each other, the blissful spiritual potency is nevertheless supreme because it establishes relationships between the Lord and the pure living entities on the platform of eternal happiness. Every living entity is originally a loving servitor of the Lord, and the spiritual energy of the Lord engages the living entity in his pure constitutional position beyond illusion.</div>
<div class="First"> Our dreaming and waking experiences are both activities of the mind; however, the activities we perform while awake are more valuable because they establish us in our permanent situation. Similarly, at every moment every living entity is experiencing one of the innumerable potencies of the Supreme Lord. However, the experience of the spiritual potency is more significant because it establishes the living entity in his eternal, constitutional position as a faithful servitor of the Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="First"> The demigods are glorifying the Lord's lotus feet because they are personally very eager to be purified by contact with those feet (taväìghrir asmäkam açubhäçaya-dhümaketuù syät). When a sincere devotee eagerly desires to attain the shelter of the Lord's lotus feet, the Lord brings him to His personal abode, just as the demigods were brought to Dvärakä by Lord Kåñëa's arrangement.</div>

Since the goddess of fortune makes her abode on Your transcendental chest, she will undoubtedly become agitated, like a jealous co-wife, upon seeing our offering also dwelling there. Yet You are so merciful that You neglect Your eternal consort Lakñmé and accept our offering as most excellent worship. O merciful Lord, may Your lotus feet always act as a blazing fire to consume the inauspicious desires within our hearts.</div>

<div class="First"> In Bhagavad-gétä (9.26) it is stated:</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">tad ahaà bhakty-upahåtam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">açnämi prayatätmanaù</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa gratefully and happily accepts even the most meager offering from His loving devotee. Lord Kåñëa is conquered by the love of His pure devotees, just as a father is easily conquered by the most insignificant gift offered by his loving child. Unless a transcendentalist completely gives up the impersonal conception of life, he cannot make such a loving offering to the Lord. The process of meditation upon the Supersoul within the heart, called dhyäna-yoga, is not as pleasing to Kåñëa as bhakti-yoga, or devotional service, because in dhyäna, or meditation, the yogé is trying to satisfy himself (and not the Lord) by attaining mystic powers. Similarly, in order to acquire material benefits from the Lord, ordinary people worship God in temples, churches and mosques. But one who desires actual spiritual perfection must be enlivened to always chant and hear the glories of the Lord. Such devotional enthusiasm is motivated by love of Godhead and is devoid of any selfish expectation. The Lord is so kind that He neglects His own eternal consort, Lakñmé, and gives preference to His humble devotee, just as a man will neglect the loving embrace of his wife when his affectionate child approaches him with a gift. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has pointed out that any garland worn by the Lord cannot be faded because all of the Lord's personal paraphernalia is completely transcendental and spiritually opulent. Similarly, there is no possibility that mundane jealousy could appear in the character of the goddess of fortune, who is as transcendental as Lord Kåñëa Himself. Therefore the statements of the demigods are to be understood as humorous words inspired by intense love of Godhead. The demigods enjoy the protection of Lakñmé and, ultimately, of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, and due to their confidence in their loving relationship with the Lord and His consort they feel free to speak in a joking way.</div>

<div class="First"> Çréla Çrédhara Svämé states: nanu yuddhe deväsurädayaù parasparaà jayanti jéyante ca kim ahaà tatrety ata ähuù, naséti. mithur mitho 'rdyamänä yuddhädibhiù péòyamänä brahmädayo 'pi yasya tava vaçe bhavanti na tu jaye paräjaye vä svatanträù. "In the perpetual battles between the demigods, or devotees of the Lord, and the demons, or nondevotees, each side sometimes conquers and is sometimes apparently defeated. One may argue that all this has nothing to do with the Personality of Godhead since it is based on nothing more than the interaction of opposing living entities. But every living entity is, however, strictly under the control of the Personality of Godhead, and victory and defeat are always in the hands of the Lord." This does not contradict the fact of the living entity's free will, since the Lord awards victory and defeat according to the merit of the living entities. In a legal battle neither the prosecution nor the defense can act independently of the legal system presided over by the authorized judge. Victory and defeat in the court are awarded by the judge, but the judge is acting according to the laws, which do not favor or discriminate against either side.</div>
<div class="First"> Similarly, the Personality of Godhead is awarding us the results of our previous activities. In order to discredit God, materialists frequently give the argument that oftentimes innocent people suffer whereas impious rogues enjoy life unimpeded. The fact is, however, that the Personality of Godhead is not a fool, as are the materialistic persons who place such arguments. The Lord can see our many previous lives; therefore He may allow one to enjoy or suffer in this life not only as a result of one's present activities, but also as a result of one's previous activities. For example, by working very hard a man may accumulate a fortune. If such a newly rich man then gives up his work and takes to a degenerate life, his fortune does not immediately disappear. On the other hand, one who is destined to become rich may now be working very hard, with discipline and austerity, and yet be without spending money. So a superficial observer might well be confused upon seeing the moral, hard-working man without funds and the degenerate, lazy man in possession of riches. Similarly, a materialistic fool without knowledge of past, present and future is unable to understand the perfect justice of the Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="First"> The example given in this verse to explain Kåñëa's controlling power is appropriate. Although a bull is extremely powerful, he is easily controlled by a slight tug on a rope strung through his pierced nose. Similarly, even the most powerful politicians, scholars, demigods, etc., may immediately be put into an unbearable situation by the omnipotent Personality of Godhead. Therefore the demigods have not come to Dvärakä to proudly display their universal political and intellectual powers but to humbly surrender at the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="First"> The word gabhéra-rayaù, or "imperceptible speed and power," is significant. We observe that by the laws of nature all material things, including our own bodies, gradually disintegrate. Although we can perceive the long-term results of this aging process, we cannot experience the process itself. For example, no one can feel how his hair or fingernails are growing. We perceive the cumulative result of their growth, but from moment to moment we cannot experience it. Similarly, a house gradually decays until it is demolished. From moment to moment we cannot perceive exactly how this is happening, but in the course of longer intervals of time we can actually see the deterioration of the house. In other words, we can experience the results or manifestations of aging and deterioration, but as it is taking place the process itself is imperceptible.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The Supreme Lord Kåñëa is within the heart of every conditioned soul and guides the living entity in the pursuit and experience of sense gratification. The disappointing results of such activities gradually convince the conditioned soul to reject material life and surrender again to the Lord within his heart. Lord Kåñëa is never affected by the futile attempts of the living entities to enjoy His illusory energy. For the Personality of Godhead there is no possibility of fear or disturbance, because nothing is ultimately separate from Him.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My Lord, You are living with sixteen thousand exquisitely beautiful, aristocratic wives. By their irresistible coy and smiling glances and by their lovely arching eyebrows, they send You messages of eager conjugal love. But they are completely unable to disturb the mind and senses of Your Lordship.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In the previous verse it was clearly stated that no material object can attract the senses of the Lord. Now in this verse it is demonstrated that the Lord has no desire to enjoy even spiritual sense gratification. Kåñëa is complete in Himself. He is the reservoir of all pleasure, and He does not lust after anything material or spiritual. The argument may by given that Kåñëa, in order to please His wife Satyabhämä, stole a pärijäta flower from heaven and thus appeared to be a henpecked husband under the control of His loving wife. But although Kåñëa is sometimes conquered by the love of His devotees, He is never influenced by the desire to enjoy like an ordinary, lusty materialistic person. The nondevotees cannot understand the overwhelming loving feelings exchanged between the Lord and His pure devotees. Kåñëa may be conquered by our intense love for Him, and thus pure devotees can control the Lord. For example, the elderly gopés in Våndävana would clap their hands in different rhythms to make Kåñëa dance, and in Dvärakä Satyabhämä ordered Kåñëa to bring her a flower as proof of His love for her. As stated in Çréniväsa Äcärya's song to the six Gosvämés, gopé-bhäva-rasämåtäbdhi-laharé-kallola-magnau muhuù: the love between the Lord and His pure devotee is an ocean of spiritual bliss. But at the same time, Kåñëa remains completely self-satisfied. Kåñëa indifferently gave up the company of the incomparable young damsels of Vraja-bhümi, the gopés, and went to Mathurä at the request of His uncle, Akrüra. Thus neither the gopés of Våndävana nor the queens of Dvärakä could arouse an enjoying spirit in Kåñëa. When all is said and done, pleasure in this world means sex. But this mundane sexual attraction is simply a perverted reflection of the transcendental loving affairs between Kåñëa and His eternal associates in the spiritual world. The gopés of Våndävana are unsophisticated village girls, whereas the queens in Dvärakä are aristocratic young ladies. But both the gopés and the queens are overwhelmed with love for Kåñëa. As the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa displays the highest perfection of beauty, strength, wealth, fame, knowledge and renunciation and is thus completely satisfied by His own supreme position. He reciprocates spiritual loving affairs with the gopés and queens simply for their sake. Only fools think that Lord Kåñëa could be attracted by the perverted illusory pleasures to which we poor conditioned souls are so blindly attached. Therefore everyone should recognize the supreme transcendental position of the Personality of Godhead and surrender to Him. That is the clear implication of this statement by the demigods.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The nectar-bearing rivers of discussions about You, and also the holy rivers generated from the bathing of Your lotus feet, are able to destroy all contamination within the three worlds.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura states, änuçravaà guror uccäraëam anuçrüyante: "One should hear about Kåñëa by hearing from the spiritual master." The bona fide spiritual master describes the pastimes, potencies and incarnations of the Personality of Godhead to his disciple. If the spiritual master is bona fide and if the disciple is sincere and obedient, then the communication between guru and disciple is just like nectar, both for the guru and the disciple. Ordinary persons cannot even imagine the special pleasure experienced by the devotees of the Lord. Such nectarean speaking and hearing destroys all contamination within the heart of a conditioned soul, the primary contamination being the desire to live without serving Kåñëa. The other nectar described here is caraëämåta, the nectarean waters that bathe the Lord's feet. Lord Vämanadeva bathed His own lotus foot by kicking a hole in the universal covering so that the sacred Ganges water washed His toes and fell into the universe. The Yamunä River also washed Kåñëa's lotus feet when the Lord appeared on this planet five thousand years ago. Kåñëa sported daily with His boyfriends and girl friends in the Yamunä River, and consequently that river is also caraëämåta. One should therefore try to take bath in the Ganges or Yamunä.</div>
<div class="First"> Every morning in ISKCON temples, the lotus feet of the Deity of Kåñëa are bathed, and the water thus sanctified is also called caraëämåta, the nectar of Kåñëa's lotus feet. Çréla Prabhupäda taught his disciples and followers to come before the Deities each morning and drink three drops of the caraëämåta from the Deities' bathing.</div>
<div class="First"> In all these ways one can purify his heart and relish spiritual bliss. When one is fixed on the platform of spiritual bliss, then one does not take another birth in the material world. In this verse the word çuci-ñadaù is significant: one must engage in the purified activities of Kåñëa consciousness. One must learn to serve the Lord from the bona fide spiritual master, whose instructions one should accept without speculation. Those who are attached to the phantasmagoria of this world sometimes concoct their own whimsical concepts of God. But only from the bona fide spiritual master can we get perfect and pure knowledge about the Supreme Personality of Godhead and devotional service to Him. Such knowledge may be found in all the books of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Unfortunately, in Kali-yuga many persons are not attracted to the authorized Vedic literatures. Minimizing the transcendental process of hearing and chanting the glories of the Personality of Godhead, they prefer to listen to useless and whimsical vibrations on the radio and television, in newspapers and magazines, and so on. Rather than hear about Kåñëa from the bona fide spiritual master, they endlessly give their own opinions about everything, until they are dragged away by the force of time. After studying the temporary, limited forms of the material world, they impatiently conclude that the Absolute Truth is formless. Such persons are actually worshiping Kåñëa's illusory energy, mäyä, who has been authorized to kick their stubborn heads. If instead people hear directly about Kåñëa from the bona fide sources, they will very easily solve all the problems of their lives. In Kali-yuga people are constantly suffering from many psychological, social, economic, historical, political and existential problems. But all these nightmarish problems can be removed as soon as one awakens to the transcendental reality of the Personality of Godhead, who is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge and beyond the bewildering manifestations of the material energy. The Lord appears within this universe so that people can observe, hear about and glorify His actual activities. In this difficult age of Kali we should all seriously take advantage of this opportunity.</div>

<div class="First"> Just as a tidal wave overwhelms the boundary of the shore and wreaks havoc on innocent people, similarly, there was imminent danger that the powerful Yadu dynasty might expand beyond all boundaries of social and political control. The members of the Yadu dynasty had become proud because of their apparent familial relationship with the Personality of Godhead. Although they were very religious and devoted to brahminical culture, they had become, as indicated by the word dåptänäm, affected by pride due to their relationship with Kåñëa. Furthermore, due to their intense love for Kåñëa, they would certainly feel such intense separation after the Lord's departure to the spiritual world that they would become maddened and thus become an unbearable burden on the earth. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has pointed out, however, that the earth herself, due to attachment for Kåñëa, would never consider Kåñëa's own family members to be anything but a welcome burden. Still, Kåñëa wanted to remove this burden. The example is given that for the pleasure of her husband a beautiful young wife may decorate herself with many golden ornaments. These ornaments constitute a painful burden for the delicate wife, but although she is willing to bear this burden, the loving husband removes the ornaments for the pleasure of his wife. So the Lord, desiring to apply the wisdom of "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure," took precautions to remove from the earth the burden of the Yadu dynasty.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Many demigods, coming to the earth to assist Lord Kåñëa in His pastimes, took birth within the Yadu dynasty and appeared as Lord Kåñëa's associates. When the Lord had completed His earthly pastimes He wanted to send these demigods back to their previous service in universal administration. Each demigod was to return to his respective planet. The transcendental city of Dvärakä is so auspicious that whoever dies there immediately goes back home, back to Godhead, but because the demigod members of the Yadu dynasty, in many cases, were not yet prepared to go back to Godhead, they had to die outside the city of Dvärakä. Thus Lord Kåñëa, pretending to be an ordinary living being, said, "We are all in danger. Let us all immediately go to Prabhäsa." In this way, by His yoga-mäyä Kåñëa bewildered such demigod members of the Yadu dynasty and led them away to the holy place Prabhäsa. Since Dvärakä is parama-maìgala, the most auspicious place, not even an imitation of inauspiciousness can take place there. Actually, Lord Kåñëa's pastime of removing the Yadu dynasty is ultimately auspicious, but since it outwardly appeared inauspicious, it could not take place in Dvärakä; therefore Lord Kåñëa led the Yadus away from Dvärakä. After having sent the demigods back to their planets, Lord Kåñëa planned to return to the spiritual world, Vaikuëöha, in His original form and remain in the eternal city of Dvärakä. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has made the following important comments on this verse. Prabhäsa is a famous holy place located near the Veraval railway station, within the region of Junagarah. In Chapter Thirty of the Eleventh Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is written that after hearing the words of Çré Kåñëa, the Yädavas went to the mainland from the island city of Dvärakä by means of boats and then traveled to Prabhäsa in chariots. At Prabhäsa-kñetra they drank a beverage called maireya and became engaged in a mutual quarrel. A great battle ensued, and killing each other with hard stalks of cane, the members of the Yadu dynasty acted out the pastime of their own annihilation.</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Çré Kåñëa, manifesting His four-armed form, sat down under a pippala tree, placing His left foot, the heel of which was colored red like the red koka-nada lotus, upon His right thigh. A hunter named Jarä, watching from the shore of the ocean at Prabhäsa, mistook the Lord's red-colored foot to be the face of a deer and shot his arrow at it.</div>
<div class="First"> At the base of that same pippala tree under which Lord Kåñëa had sat there is now a temple. One mile away from the tree, on the seashore, is the Véra-prabhaïjana Maöha, and it is said that from this point the hunter Jarä fired his arrow.</div>
<div class="First"> In the conclusion to his work Mahäbhärata-tätparya-nirëaya, Çré Madhväcärya-päda has written the following purport to the mauñala-lélä. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, in order to bewilder the demons and ensure that the word of His own devotees and of the brähmaëas be maintained, created a body of material energy into which the arrow was shot. But the Lord's actual four-armed form was never touched by the arrow of Jarä, who is actually the Lord's devotee Bhågu Åñi. In a previous age Bhågu Muni had placed his foot on the chest of Lord Viñëu. In order to counteract the offense of improperly placing his foot on the Lord's chest, Bhågu had to take birth as a degraded hunter. But even though a great devotee willingly accepts such a low birth, the Personality of Godhead cannot tolerate seeing His devotee in such a fallen condition. Thus the Personality of Godhead arranged that at the end of Dväpara-yuga, when the Lord was winding up His manifest pastimes, His devotee Bhågu, in the form of the hunter Jarä, would cast the arrow into a material body created by the Lord's illusory energy. Thus the hunter would become remorseful, gain release from his degraded birth and go back to Vaikuëöha-loka.</div>
<div class="First"> Therefore, to please His devotee Bhågu and to confuse the demons, the Supreme Lord manifested His mauñala-lélä at Prabhäsa, but it should be understood that this is an illusory pastime. The Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa, from His very appearance on the earth, did not manifest any of the material qualities of ordinary human beings. The Lord did not appear from the womb of His mother. Rather, by His inconceivable power He descended into the maternity room. At the time of His giving up this mortal world, He similarly manifested an illusory situation for the sake of bewildering the demons. To bewilder the nondevotees, the Lord created an illusory body out of His material energy while simultaneously remaining personally in His own sac-cid-änanda body, and thus He manifested the downfall of an illusory, material form. This pretense effectively bewilders foolish demons, but Lord Çré Kåñëa's actual transcendental, eternal body of bliss never experiences death. Also at Prabhäsa-kñetra there is the holy place known as Bhågu-tértha, which was manifested by Lord Paraçuräma. The place at which the two rivers Sarasvaté and Hiraëyä flow together into the ocean is named Bhågu-tértha, and there the hunter cast his arrow. There is an elaborate description of Prabhäsa-tértha in the Prabhäsa-khaëòa of the Skanda Puräëa. There are also many phala-çrutis given within the Mahäbhärata in connection with Prabhäsa-tértha. Phala-çrutis are scriptural statements that promise various auspicious results for one who performs a particular pious activity. In the following verses the Lord Himself will explain the particular benefits to be derived from visiting Prabhäsakñetra and performing religious activities there.</div>

Lord Kåñëa is not a mundane historical figure, and His activities cannot be confined within the tiny limits of material logic. Lord Kåñëa's pastimes are an exhibition of His acintya-çakti, or inconceivable potency, which functions according to higher, spiritual laws, unknown to the blind conditioned souls and their petty material logic.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Çré Uddhava said: O my Lord, O supreme God among all the demigods, real piety is invoked simply by hearing and chanting Your transcendental glories. My Lord, it appears that You will now withdraw Your dynasty, and thus You Yourself will finally give up Your pastimes within this universe. You are the supreme controller and the master of all mystic power. But although You are fully capable of counteracting the brähmaëas' curse against Your dynasty, You are not doing so, and Your disappearance is imminent.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> As previously mentioned, Kåñëa's own dynasty can never be destroyed; therefore the word saàhåtya means that Kåñëa was taking the Yädavas with Him as He left this material world. However, in the eyes of ordinary, unenlightened persons the withdrawal of the Yadu dynasty appears to be its destruction. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has very nicely explained the statement of Uddhava as follows.</div>
<div class="First"> Kåñëa is addressed as deva-deva, or the supreme God among the gods, because He expertly solved all of the problems of the demigods by His incarnation within the universe. The Lord rid the world of demons and firmly established both His devotees and religious principles. Lord Kåñëa is addressed here as yogeça because He not only performed work on behalf of the demigods, but also revealed His beautiful, transcendental form, full of transcendental qualities and ecstasies, for the pleasure of His pure devotees. Kåñëa is called puëya-çravaëa-kértana because when by His internal mystic potency He exhibited His humanlike activities, the Lord stimulated the writing of innumerable Vedic scriptures about His pastimes. Thus persons who would be born in the future, like ourselves would be able to hear and chant about the Lord's activities and also go back home, back to Godhead. Having insured the transcendental bliss and liberation of all of His devotees, even those who would be born in the future, Kåñëa decided the time had come for Him to leave this material universe. Uddhava could understand the Lord's desire and said to Kåñëa, "You have instructed the Yädavas to counteract the brähmaëas' curse by taking bath at Prabhäsakñetra, but how could mere bathing in a holy place be of greater value than seeing You, the Personality of Godhead, face to face? Since the Yädavas are always seeing Your transcendental form, and since You are the Supreme Lord, what is the use of their taking bath in a so-called holy place? Therefore You obviously have some other purpose. If You actually wanted to counteract the curse, You could simply say, 'Let this curse not act,' and the curse would immediately be neutralized. Therefore You must be preparing to leave this universe, and that is why You have not counteracted the curse."</div>

<div class="Translation"> O Lord Keçava, my dear master, I cannot tolerate giving up Your lotus feet even for a fraction of a moment. I urge You to take me along with You to Your own abode.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Uddhava understood that Kåñëa was going to withdraw the Yadu dynasty, and thus he begged the Lord to take him along to the Lord's abode. He had no desire to merge into Kåñëa's impersonal effulgence; instead he wanted to go to the Lord's spiritual abode and continue associating with Kåñëa as His dearmost friend. Kåñëa is the Personality of Godhead and can do whatever He likes, but the devotee begs the Lord for the chance to serve Him. Although the Lord manifests within the material world His various abodes, such as Våndävana, Dvärakä and Mathurä, and although these are certainly nondifferent from their counterparts in the spiritual world, the most advanced devotees, overwhelmed with desire to personally serve the Lord, are very eager to go to the Lord's original spiritual planet. As stated by Lord Kapila in the Third Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, the pure devotees have no desire for liberation. Because of their eagerness to render service, they urge the Lord to appear before them. The six Gosvämés, due to their intense eagerness to serve Rädhä and Kåñëa, urgently searched after Them, calling out Their names in the forests of Våndävana. Similarly, Uddhava is urging the Lord to take him to His own abode so that Uddhava's personal service to the Lord's lotus feet will not be interrupted even for a moment.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has pointed out that immature conditioned souls think that Lord Kåñëa is an ordinary jéva soul engaged in material activities and was thus unable to protect His own dynasty from the curse of the brähmaëas. Uddhava's statement corrects such unfortunate persons. It is Lord Kåñëa Himself who awarded pious living entities birth in brahminical families, and then Lord Kåñëa further awarded them the potency to curse His dynasty. And finally, Lord Kåñëa personally kept the curse intact, although He was capable of neutralizing it. Therefore in the beginning, middle and end, directly and indirectly, in the past, present and future, Lord Kåñëa is the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He is completely transcendental to even the slightest touch of material illusion or impotence.</div>

Therefore, a pure devotee can never give up Kåñëa, even for a moment, although for Kåñëa's pleasure he can give up the entire universe.</div>

Uddhava is addressing the Lord as follows: "Even if Your illusory energy tries to attack us, my Lord, we will very easily conquer her by our powerful weapons, which are the remnants of Your foodstuffs, clothes, ornaments, and so on. In other words, we will easily conquer over mäyä by kåñëa-prasädam, and not by useless speculation and mental concoction."</div>

<div class="First"> In Chapter Twelve of Bhagavad-gétä it is stated, kleço 'dhikataras teñäm avyaktäsakta-cetasäm: those who are attached to the impersonal feature of the Personality of Godhead must endure grueling penances in order to achieve impersonal liberation in the realm of Brahman. Also it is stated in the Bhägavatam, äruhya kåcchreëa paraà padaà tataù/ patanty adho 'nädåta-yuñmad-aìghrayaù [SB 10.2.32]. Kåcchreëa: with great struggle and trouble the yogés climb their way up into the impersonal effulgence called brahmajyoti, but again they slip out of the jyoti and fall back into the material world because they do not take shelter of the Personality of Godhead. Envious fools object to the "paternalism" of the Personality of Godhead, but these fools cannot take credit for the creation of their own body, brain or energy, nor can they claim credit for the air, rain, vegetables, fruits, sun, moon, and so on. In other words, they are totally dependent on the mercy of God at every second, and yet they arrogantly state that they do not want to accept the shelter of the Lord, because they are self-sufficient. In fact, some bewildered living entities even think that they themselves are God, although they cannot explain why "God" has to struggle and toil to achieve meager success in the yoga system. Therefore Uddhava is pointing out that, unlike the impersonalists and meditators, the pure devotees very easily cross over the illusory energy because they are totally attached to the lotus feet of Kåñëa. Lord Kåñëa is always transcendental, and if one is firmly attached to the Lord's lotus feet, then he is also transcendental. The causeless mercy of Kåñëa is more valuable than millions and billions of years of one's own struggling and straining. One should try to get the Lord's mercy, and then everything will become very easy on the path of spiritual realization. In this age one can achieve the mercy of Lord Kåñëa by constantly chanting His holy name, as recommended in the çästra:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">harer näma harer näma</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">harer nämaiva kevalam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kalau nästy eva nästy eva</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">[Cc. Ädi 17.21]</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">(Båhan-näradéya Puräëa)</div>
<div class="First"> If one constantly chants Lord Kåñëa's holy names, avoiding offenses against the names, then surely one will achieve the same result as Uddhava. Uddhava was not interested in so-called Brahman realization, but rather he wanted to go on drinking the maddening nectar of the beautiful smiling of the Lord's moonlike face.</div>

<div class="Translation"> O greatest of mystics, although we are conditioned souls wandering on the path of fruitive work, we will certainly cross beyond the darkness of this material world simply by hearing about Your Lordship in the association of Your devotees. Thus we are always remembering and glorifying the wonderful things You do and the wonderful things You say. We ecstatically recall Your amorous pastimes with Your confidential conjugal devotees and how You boldly smile and move about while engaged in such youthful pastimes. My dear Lord, Your loving pastimes are bewilderingly similar to the activities of ordinary people within this material world.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In this verse Uddhava, by stating bhramantaù karma-vartmasu, humbly presents himself as one of the conditioned souls entangled in fruitive activities. Still, Uddhava is confident that he will certainly cross over the illusory energy because he is addicted to chanting and remembering the glorious activities and words of Lord Kåñëa. Similarly, Rüpa Gosvämé has stated:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">éhä yasya harer däsye</div>

<div class="First"> Although one may outwardly appear to be involved in this material world, if one is always engaged, twenty-four hours a day, in the service of Lord Kåñëa, then one is considered to be a liberated soul. Uddhava states here that hearing and chanting the holy name and pastimes of Kåñëa is infinitely more effective than becoming a naked yogé in the forest and running the constant risk of becoming, due to lusty desires and sex indulgence, a naked monkey in the forest. Uddhava is begging the Lord for the mercy of His Sudarçana cakra, whose effulgence is represented by the process of remembering and chanting the pastimes of the Lord. One who absorbs himself in the incomparable bliss of thinking of the Lord's abode easily becomes free from all lamentation, illusion and fear. That is the recommendation of Çré Uddhava.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté, the conditioned living entities, by their movements, laughter, activities and words, simply bind themselves more and more in material existence. But if they engage in hearing and chanting about the pastimes of the Personality of Godhead, the conditioned souls will achieve liberation from the bondage of repeated birth and death. This process of supreme liberation will now be elaborately described by Lord Çré Kåñëa to His dearmost devotee Çré Uddhava. Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Sixth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Yadu Dynasty Retires to Prabhäsa."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 7. Lord Kåñëa Instructs Uddhava</div>
<div class="First"> As described in this chapter, the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, replied to Uddhava's prayerful entreaty that he be allowed to return with Him to His abode. Kåñëa advised Uddhava to take to the renounced order of sannyäsa, and when Uddhava showed interest in more elaborate instructions, the Lord further described the avadhüta's account of his twenty-eight spiritual masters. After hearing Uddhava's prayerful request to be taken back with Him to the spiritual world, Lord Kåñëa informed him that He was indeed desirous of returning to His own personal abode because the purpose of His descent had been successfully fulfilled and the misfortunes of Kali-yuga would soon beset the earth. He thus advised Uddhava to take up sannyäsa by fixing his mind upon Him and establishing himself in theoretical and realized transcendental knowledge. The Lord further instructed Uddhava that while remaining untouched by contamination and compassionately disposed to all beings, he should begin wandering throughout this temporary world, which is simply the combined manifestation of the Lord's illusory energy and the imagination of the living entities.</div>
<div class="First"> Uddhava then stated that renouncing material things in a spirit of detachment is the source of the highest auspiciousness, but such renunciation is certainly extremely difficult to accomplish for living entities other than the devotees of the Supreme Lord, because they are very attached to sense gratification. Uddhava expressed the need for some instruction by which foolish persons who misidentify the body as the self can be convinced to carry out their duties in accordance with the order of the Supreme Lord. Even great demigods like Brahmä are not completely surrendered to the Lord, but Uddhava declared that he himself had taken shelter of the only true instructor of the Absolute Truth-Lord Näräyaëa, the all-perfect, all-knowing master of Vaikuëöha and the only real friend of all living entities. Hearing this, the Supreme Lord replied that actually the jéva soul is his own guru. Within this human body, the living beings can search out the Supreme Lord by positive and negative means and ultimately achieve Him. For this reason the human form of life is most dear to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this regard, Lord Kåñëa began to describe an ancient conversation between a brähmaëa avadhüta and the great king Yadu.</div>
<div class="First"> The son of Yayäti, Mahäräja Yadu, once encountered an avadhüta who was traveling about, here and there, in great transcendental ecstasy and was acting unpredictably, just like someone who has become haunted by a ghost. The King inquired from the holy man about the cause of his wandering and his ecstatic condition, and the avadhüta replied that he had received various instructions from twenty-four different gurus-the earth, the wind, the sky, the water, fire, and so on. Because of the knowledge he had gained from them, he was able to travel about the earth in a liberated state. From the earth he had learned how to be sober, and from the two manifestations of earth, namely the mountain and the tree, he had learned, respectively, how to serve others and how to dedicate one's whole life to the benefit of others. From the wind, manifesting in the form of the vital air within the body, he had learned how to be satisfied with merely keeping oneself alive, and from the external wind he had learned how to remain uncontaminated by the body and the objects of the senses. From the sky he had learned how the soul, which pervades all material substances, is both indivisible and imperceptible, and from the water he had learned how to be naturally clear and purifying. From the fire he had learned how to devour all things without becoming dirtied and how to destroy all the inauspicious desires of those who make offerings to him. He had also learned from fire how the spirit soul enters into every body and gives illumination and how the birth and death of those who are embodied cannot be discerned. From the moon he had learned how the material body undergoes growth and dwindling. From the sun he had learned how to avoid entanglement even while coming into contact with sense objects, and he had also learned about the two different modes of perception based on seeing the real form of the soul and seeing false designative coverings. From the pigeon he had learned how too much affection and excessive attachment are not good for one. This human body is the open door to liberation, but if one becomes attached to family life like the pigeon, one is compared to a person who has climbed up to a high place just to fall down again.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: O greatly fortunate Uddhava, you have accurately revealed My desire to withdraw the Yadu dynasty from the earth and return to My own abode in Vaikuëöha. Thus Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva and all other planetary rulers are now praying for Me to resume My residence in Vaikuëöha.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Each and every demigod has his particular abode in the heavenly planets within the material universe. Although Lord Viñëu is sometimes counted among the demigods, His abode is in Vaikuëöha, the spiritual sky. The demigods are universal controllers within the kingdom of mäyä, but Viñëu is the Lord of the illusory potency and many other spiritual potencies. His exalted residence does not lie within the kingdom of His insignificant maidservant mäyä.</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Viñëu, the Personality of Godhead, is the Supreme Lord of all lords; the demigods are His separated parts and parcels. Being themselves minute jéva souls, the demigods are under the influence of the potency of mäyä; but Lord Viñëu is always the supreme controller of mäyä. The Personality of Godhead is the reservoir and root of all existence, and the material world is just a dim reflection of the brilliant scenery of His eternal, spiritual abode, where everything is infinitely beautiful and pleasurable. Viñëu is the supreme reality, and no living entity can ever be equal to or greater than Him. The Lord exists within His own unique category called viñëu-tattva, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. All other prominent or extraordinary living entities owe their positions and potencies to the Lord. Ultimately Viñëu Himself is a plenary expansion of Lord Kåñëa, the original source of all the viñëu-tattva and jéva-tattva expansions. Thus Lord Kåñëa is the basis of everything.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In this and the following verses, Lord Kåñëa indicates to Uddhava that he should immediately fix himself in self-realization by giving up all identification with the material world. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has pointed out that the Yadu dynasty was not actually destroyed by Lord Kåñëa but merely removed from the vision of the world through the curse of the brähmaëas; similarly, the Lord's eternal abode Dvärakä can never be drowned by the ocean. Nevertheless, all external approaches to this transcendental city were covered by the ocean, and thus the Lord's abode remains inaccessible to foolish persons in Kali-yuga, as will be described later in this canto. By the Lord's mystic potency, called yoga-mäyä, He reveals His own form, abode, paraphernalia, pastimes, entourage, and so on, and at the suitable time He removes all of these from our mundane sight. Although bewildered conditioned souls may doubt the spiritual potency of the Lord, the pure devotees can directly perceive and relish His transcendental appearance and disappearance, which are described in Bhagavad-gétä as janma karma ca me divyam [Bg. 4.9]. If one faithfully accepts this perfect knowledge of the Lord's transcendental nature, then surely one will go back home, back to Godhead, and become an eternal companion of Lord Kåñëa.</div>

<div class="Translation"> O saintly Uddhava, in the near future I will abandon this earth. Then, being overwhelmed by the age of Kali, the earth will be bereft of all piety.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa's plan was to bring Uddhava back to His own eternal abode after a brief delay. Because of Uddhava's extraordinary spiritual qualities, the Lord wanted to engage him in propagating His message among other saintly persons who were not yet advanced to the stage of pure devotional service. However, the Lord assured Uddhava that he would not be bereft of the Lord's association for even a moment. Also, because Uddhava had become a perfect master of his senses, he would never be afflicted by the three modes of material nature. In this way, before bringing Uddhava back home, back to Godhead, the Lord empowered him to carry out a specific confidential mission. Wherever the supreme position of the Personality of Godhead is not recognized, useless mental speculation becomes very prominent, and the safe and sure path of hearing perfect Vedic knowledge becomes covered by the chaos of mental concoction. At the present time, especially in the Western countries, literally millions of books are being published on hundreds and thousands of subjects; yet despite this proliferation of mental concoction people remain totally in ignorance about the most fundamental issues of human life, namely, Who am I? Where have I come from? Where am I going? What is my soul? What is God?</div>
<div class="First"> The Personality of Godhead, Lord Çré Kåñëa, is the reservoir of innumerable enchanting pastimes, and thus He is the source of innumerable varieties of pleasure. In fact, He is the ocean of eternal pleasure. When the eternal soul is bereft of the constitutional pleasure that comes from loving service to the Lord, he is overwhelmed and bewildered by material nature. He helplessly chases after material sense gratification, thinking that one material object is good and another bad, and constantly changes his assessment of what is good and what is bad. Thus he derives no peace or pleasure, is in constant anxiety and is repeatedly thrashed by the cruel laws of nature in the form of birth, death, old age and disease.</div>
<div class="First"> In this way the conditioned soul becomes a fit candidate to take birth in Kali-yuga, which is the epitome of misfortune. In Kali-yuga the living entities, who are already suffering so many tribulations, mercilessly turn against one another. Human society in Kali-yuga becomes savagely violent, and men open slaughterhouses to butcher hundreds of millions of innocent creatures. Large-scale wars are declared, and millions of human beings, even women and children, are quickly annihilated.</div>
<div class="First"> Unless the living entity recognizes the authority of the Personality of Godhead, he remains a helpless victim in the clutches of mäyä, or material illusion. He concocts different solutions to release himself from mäyä, but these solutions are themselves creations of mäyä and thus cannot possibly release the conditioned soul. In fact, they only intensify his distress. In the next verse, Lord Kåñëa specifically warns Uddhava to avoid Kali-yuga and go back home, back to Godhead. Those of us who have already taken birth in Kali-yuga should also heed this advice and immediately take all necessary steps to go back to the Lord's eternal abode for a blissful life of perfect knowledge. The material world is never a happy place, especially during the fearful days of Kali-yuga.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear Uddhava, you should not remain here on the earth once I have abandoned this world. My dear devotee, you are sinless, but in Kali-yuga the people will be addicted to all types of sinful activities; therefore do not stay here.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In this age of Kali, human beings are totally unaware that the Supreme Personality of Godhead comes personally to the earth to manifest His transcendental pastimes as they are enacted in the spiritual world. Heedless of the authority of the Personality of Godhead, the fallen souls of Kali-yuga become engulfed in bitter quarrel and cruelly harass one another. Because people in Kali-yuga are addicted to polluted, sinful activities, they are always angry, lusty and frustrated. In Kali-yuga the devotees of the Personality of Godhead, who are engaged in the ever-increasing loving service of the Lord, should never be attracted to living on the earth, the population of which is covered in the darkness of ignorance and devoid of any loving relationship with the Lord. Thus Lord Kåñëa advised Uddhava not to remain on the earth in Kali-yuga. In fact, in Bhagavad-gétä the Lord advises all living entities that they should never remain anywhere within the material universe—during any age. Therefore every living being should take advantage of the pressures of Kali-yuga to understand the overall useless nature of the material world and surrender himself at the lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa. Following in the footsteps of Çré Uddhava, one should surrender to Kåñëa and go back home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çrémad Véraräghava Äcärya has explained the concept of equal vision as follows: sama-dåk sarvasya brahmätmakatvänusandhäna-rüpa-sama-dåñöimän. "One who is on the path of self-realization should always endeavor to see the ultimate spiritual nature of all existence." The word mayi in this verse means paramätmani. One should fix one's mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the source of everything. Thus as one passes one's life on the earth, using up one's allotted time, one should practice seeing all things and all people as part and parcel of the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. Since all living entities are part and parcel of Kåñëa, ultimately they all have the same spiritual status. The material nature, also being an emanation of Kåñëa, has a similar spiritual status, but although matter and spirit are both emanations from the Personality of Godhead, they do not exist exactly on the same level. In Bhagavad-gétä it is said that the spirit soul is the superior energy of the Lord, whereas the material nature is His inferior energy. However, since Lord Kåñëa is equally present in all things, the word sama-dåk in this verse indicates that one must ultimately see Kåñëa within everything and everything within Kåñëa. Thus equal vision is compatible with mature knowledge of the varieties present within this world.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura comments as follows on this verse. "At the end of His manifest pastimes on the earth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, thought as follows within His mind: 'During My pastimes on the earth, I have satisfied the desires of all those devotees who anxiously desired to see Me. I have duly married many thousands of queens, headed by Rukmiëé, whom I personally kidnapped, and I have killed innumerable demons in various places and by various means. I have attended meetings, reunions and ceremonies with many friends, relatives and well-wishers in cities such as Våndävana, Mathurä, Dvärakä, Hastinäpura and Mithilä, and thus I have kept constantly busy coming and going in the performance of pastimes. " 'I further arranged to give My personal association to great devotees who are situated below the earthly planet. In order to please My mother Devaké and return her six deceased sons who were killed by Kaàsa, I descended to the planet Sutala and blessed My great devotee Bali Mahäräja. In order to return the dead son of My spiritual master, Sändépani Muni, I personally went to the court of Ravinandana, or Yamaräja, and thus he was able to see Me face to face. I even blessed the residents of heaven, such as mother Aditi and Kaçyapa Muni, with My personal association when I traveled there to steal the pärijäta flower for My wife Satyabhämä. And in order to please the inhabitants of Mahä-Viñëu's abode, such as Nanda, Sunanda and Sudarçana, I traveled to Mahä-vaikuëöhaloka to recover the deceased children of a frustrated brähmaëa. Thus, innumerable devotees who ardently desired to see Me have received the object of their prayers.</div>
<div class="First"> " 'Unfortunately Nara-Näräyaëa Åñi and the great paramahaàsa sages who live with Him in Badarikäçrama, although most enthusiastic to see Me, never had their desire fulfilled. I have been on the earth for 125 years, and the scheduled time is now up. Being busily engaged in My pastimes, I did not have time to give My blessings to these great sages. Nevertheless, Uddhava is practically the same as Me. He is a great devotee and shares My own transcendental opulences. Thus, he is the right person for Me to send to Badarikäçrama. I shall give Uddhava complete transcendental knowledge by which one becomes detached from the material world, and he in turn can deliver this knowledge, the science of transcending the kingdom of illusion, to the worthy sages at Badarikäçrama. In this way he can teach them the method of rendering loving devotional service to My lotus feet. Such loving devotional service rendered to Me is the most valuable treasure, and by hearing such knowledge the desires of the great sages such as Nara-Näräyaëa will be completely fulfilled.</div>
<div class="First"> " 'Those great souls who have surrendered unto Me are always equipped with transcendental knowledge and detachment from the material world. Sometimes, being busy in their devotional service, they may appear to forget Me. However, a pure devotee who has achieved the platform of love for Me will always be protected by such sincere devotion. Even if such a devotee should suddenly give up his life while neglecting to fix his mind intensely on Me, such a devotee's loving feelings are so powerful that they afford him all protection. Even if there is a temporary moment of forgetfulness, such devotion will bring the devotee to My lotus feet, which are beyond the vision of ordinary, materialistic persons. Uddhava is My pure devotee. Knowledge of Me and detachment from this world have again been aroused in him because he can never give up My association.' "</div>
<div class="First"> The sincere servants of Caitanya Mahäprabhu are vigorously endeavoring to spread this Kåñëa consciousness movement for the pleasure of their spiritual master and Lord Kåñëa. At the present time thousands of devotees in the Kåñëa consciousness movement, in all parts of the world, are working long hours under difficult conditions to distribute transcendental literature and thus enlighten the general populace. In this effort the devotees have no personal motivation but are simply desirous of pleasing their spiritual master by distributing his books. The people who receive this literature usually have no previous experience of Kåñëa consciousness, yet they are so impressed by the purity of the devotees they meet that they eagerly purchase the books and magazines. In order to execute the tremendous task of spreading Kåñëa consciousness, the devotees are tirelessly laboring day and night because they are on the platform of loving devotion. Although superficially such busy devotees may occasionally not think directly of the lotus feet of Kåñëa, such loving devotion will undoubtedly take them back to Kåñëa's lotus feet, and being pleased by their service, the Lord Himself will again arouse their unflinching meditation upon His personal form. This is the beauty of bhakti-yoga, which depends wholly and solely on the mercy of the all-merciful Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa. This is the only totally safe means of uprooting the deep desires for material enjoyment, attaining pure love for Kåñëa and going beyond the material universe to the kingdom of God. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (2.40):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nehäbhikrama-näço 'sti</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">pratyaväyo na vidyate</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">träyate mahato bhayät</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa also advised Uddhava in this verse to give up the illusory attachment to so-called friends and family within this material world. One may not be able to physically give up association with family and friends, but one should understand that everyone and everything is part and parcel of God and is meant for the pleasure of God. As soon as one thinks, "This is my personal family," immediately one will see the material world as no more than a place for enjoying family life. As soon as one is attached to one's so-called family, false prestige and material possessiveness arise. Actually, everyone is part and parcel of God and therefore, on the spiritual platform, related to all other entities. This is called kåñëa-sambandha, or the constitutional relationship with Kåñëa. It is not possible to advance to the highest stage of spiritual awareness and at the same time maintain a petty material concept of society, friendship and love. One should experience all relationships on the higher, spiritual platform of kåñëa-sambandha, which means seeing everything in relation to Lord Kåñëa, the Personality of Godhead. One who is situated in his constitutional relationship with Kåñëa can see all things in relation to Kåñëa. He thus gives up the mundane urges of the body, mind and speech and travels throughout the earth as a devotee of the Lord. Such a highly elevated personality is called gosvämé, or the master of the senses. This stage is described in Bhagavad-gétä (18.54) by the words brahma-bhütaù prasannätmä: on the spiritual platform one attains complete satisfaction.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> My dear Uddhava, the material universe that you perceive through your mind, speech, eyes, ears and other senses is an illusory creation that one imagines to be real due to the influence of mäyä. In fact, you should know that all of the objects of the material senses are temporary.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The question may be raised that since we find good and bad qualities throughout the material world, how can Lord Kåñëa advise Uddhava to see everything equally? In this verse Kåñëa explains that material good and evil are a creation of the illusory energy, just as the objects of a dream are a mental creation.</div>
<div class="First"> As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, väsudevaù sarvam iti: [Bg. 7.19] Lord Kåñëa is actually everything because He is present within everything and everything is present within Him. Kåñëa is sarva-loka-maheçvaram [Bg. 5.29], the Lord and proprietor of all worlds. To see anything separate from Kåñëa is illusion, and attraction to any kind of material illusion, either good or bad, is ultimately useless since it obliges the living entity to continue wandering in the cycle of birth and death.</div>
<div class="First"> Seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and touching constitute the activities of the five knowledge-gathering senses. Similarly, the voice, the hands, the legs, the anus and the genital constitute the five working senses. These ten senses are organized around the mind, which is the center of material activity. When the living entity desires to exploit matter, he is covered by the three modes of nature. Thus he concocts different philosophical, political and social explanations of reality but never understands the Absolute Truth, Lord Kåñëa, who is beyond the contaminated perception of the material senses. One who is entangled in the network of material designations, such as race, nationality, sectarian religion, political affiliation, etc., is absorbed in the experience of combining his body and other bodies with material sense objects, thinking these sense objects to be sources of happiness and satisfaction. Unfortunately, the entire material world, along with the senses that experience it, is a temporary creation that will be annihilated by the time potency of the Supreme Lord. Despite our foolish hopes and dreams, there is no actual happiness on the material platform. The real truth is not material, nor is it temporary. The real truth is called ätmä, or the eternal soul, and among all eternal souls one is supreme. He is called the Personality of Godhead, and in His original form He is known as Kåñëa. The knowledge-gathering process culminates in perception of the inconceivable, transcendental form of Kåñëa. One who is not perceiving Kåñëa in everything and everything in Kåñëa is undoubtedly on the platform of mental concoction. In this verse Lord Kåñëa warns Uddhava to remain clear of this illusory platform of existence.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> One whose consciousness is bewildered by illusion perceives many differences in value and meaning among material objects. Thus one engages constantly on the platform of material good and evil and is bound by such conceptions. Absorbed in material duality, such a person contemplates the performance of compulsory duties, nonperformance of such duties and performance of forbidden activities.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The illusory mental platform of existence is described in this verse. The word ayuktasya indicates the conditioned soul who does not fix his mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is clearly described in Bhagavad-gétä and other Vedic literature that Lord Kåñëa, the Absolute Truth, is within everything, and everything is within the Lord. The example may be given that when a woman loves a man, she is most eager to see him, and she daily sees him dressed in different clothes. Actually the woman is interested not in the clothes but in the man. Similarly, within every material object is the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore one who has developed love of God is constantly seeing the Lord everywhere, and not just the superficial material objects that cover the Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> The word ayuktasya in this verse indicates one who has not come to the stage of reality. Such a person, being deprived of loving devotional service to Lord Kåñëa, attempts to enjoy the innumerable forms and flavors of material experience. This temporary, illusory engagement is not the constitutional function of the bewildered living entity, who remains without any awareness of the ultimate reality, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Within the world of matter there are undoubtedly varieties. Among dogs there are pedigree poodles and common mutts, and among horses there are thoroughbreds and old gray mares. Similarly, some human beings are beautiful and educated and others are dull and homely. Some are rich and some are poor. In nature we find fertile land and sterile land, lush forests and useless deserts, invaluable gems and colorless stones, flowing transparent rivers and stagnant dirty ponds. In human society we find happiness and distress, love and hate, victory and defeat, war and peace, life and death, and so on. However, we do not have any permanent relationship with any of these conditions, because we are eternal spirit souls, part and parcel of Lord Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vedic culture is arranged in such a way that everyone can become perfect in self-realization simply by performing his occupational duty for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sve sve karmaëy abhirataù saàsiddhià labhate naraù. Some conditioned souls, however, believe that complete perfection in life may be achieved by performing ordinary, nonspiritual duties on behalf of family, nation, humanity, and so on. Others are interested in neither service to God nor noble mundane activities, and there are others who actively pursue sinful life. Such sinful persons generally rise from bed late in the afternoon and stay awake all night, taking intoxicants and engaging in illicit sex. Such a dark, hellish existence is caused by attraction to tamo-guëa, the mode of ignorance. Actions in the mode of ignorance are called vikarma, as mentioned in this verse. Unfortunately, neither the materially responsible person nor the materially irresponsible person nor the sinful person can achieve the real perfection of life, Kåñëa consciousness. Although different societies and different individuals maintain different concepts of good and evil, all material things are ultimately useless in terms of our eternal self-interest, which is Kåñëa consciousness. This idea is expressed by the saintly King Citraketu in the Sixth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (6.17.20):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">guëa-praväha etasmin</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kaù çäpaù ko nv anugrahaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kaù svargo narakaù ko vä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kià sukhaà duùkham eva vä</div>
<div class="First"> "This material world resembles the waves of a constantly flowing river. Therefore, what is a curse and what is a favor? What are the heavenly planets and what are the hellish planets? What is actually happiness and what is actually distress? Because the waves flow constantly, none of them has an eternal effect." The argument may be given that since in the Vedas there are prescribed and forbidden activities, the Vedas also accept the concept of good and evil within the material world. The fact is, however, that it is not the Vedas themselves but the conditioned souls who are bound up in material duality. The function of Vedic literature is to engage each individual at the particular level on which he is presently situated and gradually elevate him to the perfection of life. The material mode of goodness is not itself spiritual, but it does not impede spiritual life. Since the material mode of goodness purifies one's consciousness and creates a hankering for higher knowledge, it is a favorable platform from which to pursue spiritual life, just as the airport is a favorable place from which to travel. If a man desires to travel from New York to London, the New York airport is certainly the most favorable place from which to travel. But if the man misses his plane, he is no closer to London than anyone in New York who did not go to the airport. In other words, the advantage of the airport is meaningful only if one catches his plane. Similarly, the material mode of goodness is the most favorable situation from which to move up to the spiritual platform. The Vedas prescribe and forbid various activities to lift the conditioned soul to the material mode of goodness, and from that point he should rise to the spiritual platform by transcendental knowledge. Therefore if one does not come to the platform of Kåñëa consciousness, his elevation to the material mode of goodness is useless, just as a trip to the airport is useless for one who misses his plane. In the Vedas there are injunctions and prohibitions that appear to accept good and evil among material things, but the ultimate purpose of the Vedic regulations is to create a favorable situation for spiritual life. If one can immediately take to spiritual life then there is no need to waste time with rituals within the modes of nature. Therefore Kåñëa advises Arjuna in Bhagavad-gétä (2.45),</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">trai-guëya-visayä vedä</div>

<div class="First"> "The Vedas mainly deal with the subject of the three modes of material nature. Rise above these modes, O Arjuna. Be transcendental to all of them. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the Self." In this connection, Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted the following verses from Mahäbhärata:</div>

<div class="First"> "Within the material world, the conditioned souls consider residence on the heavenly planets and celestial pleasures, such as the pious enjoyment of beautiful women, to be good and desirable things. Similarly, painful or miserable conditions are considered to be evil or bad. However, all such perception of good and bad in the material world is undoubtedly based upon the fundamental mistake of considering oneself, and not the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to be the ultimate doer or performer of all actions."</div>

<div class="Translation"> Therefore, bringing all your senses under control and thus subduing the mind, you should see the entire world as situated within the self, who is expanded everywhere, and you should also see this individual self within Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word vitatam, or "widely expanded," implies that the individual jéva soul is present throughout the material universe. Similarly, in Bhagavad-gétä (2.24) Lord Kåñëa states, nityaù sarva-gataù: the individual soul is eternal and is expanded everywhere throughout the material and spiritual worlds. This does not mean, however, that each individual soul is all-pervading, but that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. has expanded His marginal potency everywhere. Thus, one should not blindly conclude that a minute living entity is all-pervading; rather, one should understand that God is great and expands His personal energy everywhere. In this verse, ätmanékñasva vitatam means that this material world is created to facilitate the sense gratification of the conditioned souls, who are trying to enjoy without Kåñëa, their actual master. The living entities are busily trying to exploit the external energy of the Lord, but their jurisdiction over the material world is illusory. Both the material nature and the conditioned living being are energies of the Lord and thus exist within the Personality of Godhead and are under His supreme control. The individual living entity exists for the pleasure of the Personality of Godhead and is the Lord's eternal servant. As soon as the senses become absorbed in material gratification they lose their power to experience the Absolute Truth. The actual goal of sense activity is satisfaction of Viñëu, the Lord, and all of the senses can experience infinite spiritual pleasure by perceiving and serving the Lord in His personal feature. Those who adopt the impersonal conception of God, however, try to stop all sense activity. But because the senses cannot remain permanently inactive they naturally return to activities in the realm of material illusion. If one engages the senses in the service of the Personality of Godhead, then one enjoys unlimited pleasure upon seeing the transcendental beauty of the Lord's form. But unless one qualifies himself by pure loving devotion to Kåñëa, the Lord does not award him this exalted experience. Therefore, every conditioned soul should end his unnecessary separation from the Personality of Godhead by rejoining the Lord's blissful company. Lord Kåñëa personally comes down to reopen the blind eyes of the conditioned souls, and thus the Lord is personally teaching Uddhava so that sincere souls in the future might take advantage of His instructions. Indeed, hundreds and millions of people even now derive spiritual enlightenment from Lord Kåñëa's instructions to Arjuna in Bhagavad-gétä.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> As explained in Bhagavad-gétä, one whose mind is free from material desire becomes disinterested in demigod worship, since the purpose of such worship is material amelioration. The demigods, however, are never displeased with one who becomes a pure devotee of Lord Kåñëa and offers all of his worship to the Lord. The demigods themselves are humble servants of Lord Kåñëa, as was amply demonstrated in Lord Kåñëa's pastimes on the earth. One who can experience the eternal soul within everyone's body certainly becomes dear to all living beings. Since he sees everyone as qualitatively equal to himself, he does not envy anyone nor try to lord it over any other living being. Being free from envy and a well-wisher of all, such a self-realized soul is naturally dear to everyone.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> One who has developed transcendental knowledge never acts whimsically. Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé describes two stages of devotional service: sädhana-bhakti and rägänugä-bhakti. Rägänugä-bhakti is the stage of spontaneous love of Godhead, whereas sädhana-bhakti means the conscientious practice of the regulative principles of devotional service. In most cases, one who is now enjoying transcendental consciousness has rigidly practiced the rules and regulations of devotional service. Thus, due to previous practice, one spontaneously avoids sinful life and acts in accordance with the standards of ordinary piety. This does not mean that a self-realized soul is consciously avoiding sin and pursuing piety. Rather, due to his self-realized nature, he spontaneously engages in the most exalted spiritual activities, just as an innocent child may spontaneously exhibit good qualities such as kindness, tolerance, and so on. The spiritual platform is called çuddha-sattva, or purified goodness, to distinguish it from the material mode of goodness, which is always to some extent polluted by the lower modes of passion and ignorance. Thus if a man in material goodness appears to be most pious in the eyes of the world, we can only imagine the spotless character of a self-realized soul in purified spiritual goodness. Therefore it is stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (5.18.12):</div>

For my supreme benefit You have explained the procedure for giving up the material world through the process of sannyäsa, or renunciation.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word yogeça here indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead awards the results of all yoga practices. Since all of the material and spiritual worlds emanate from the transcendental body of Kåñëa, there is nothing to be achieved by any yoga process except Kåñëa and His potencies. And since the Lord remains eternally the master of His potencies, no one can achieve anything through yoga, or any other spiritual or material process, except by the sanction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The word yoga means "linking up," and unless we link ourselves with the Absolute Truth, we remain covered by the darkness of ignorance. Thus, Kåñëa is the goal of yoga. In the material world we falsely try to link ourselves with the objects of the senses. Man wants to link with woman and woman with man, or one tries to link up with nationalism, socialism, capitalism or innumerable other creations of the illusory energy of the Lord. Since we are linking ourselves to temporary objects the relationships are temporary, the results are temporary, and at the time of death we become bewildered when all of our connections are suddenly cut off by mäyä. If we link ourselves to Kåñëa, however, our relationship with Him will continue even after death. As explained in Bhagavad-gétä, the relationship with Kåñëa that we develop in this life will continue to increase in our next life until we achieve the supreme goal of entering Kåñëa's planet. Those who sincerely serve the mission of Caitanya Mahäprabhu, following the transcendental life-style prescribed by the Lord, will enter the Lord's abode at the end of this lifetime.</div>
<div class="First"> One can never achieve a permanent situation by mental speculation, and what to speak of by ordinary material sense gratification. By the methods of haöha-yoga, karma-yoga, räja-yoga, jïäna-yoga, etc., one does not actually awaken his propensity for rendering eternal loving service to the Personality of Godhead. Thus, one is bereft of the transcendental tastes of spiritual enjoyment. Sometimes the conditioned soul, disgusted by his failure to gratify his senses, bitterly decides to renounce the material world and merge into an impersonal, painless transcendence. But our actual happy situation is to render loving service at the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead. All of the different yoga processes gradually lead one to love of Godhead, and it is Lord Kåñëa's aim to reestablish the conditioned souls in this happy position. Caitanya Mahäprabhu is making this perfection easily available through the chanting of the holy name of Kåñëa, the supreme yoga process for this age.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear Lord, O Supreme Soul, for those whose minds are attached to sense gratification, and especially for those bereft of devotion unto You, such renunciation of material enjoyment is most difficult to perform. That is my opinion.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Those who are truly devoted to the Supreme Lord do not accept anything for their personal gratification but rather accept those things suitable to be offered in the Lord's loving service. The word viñayätmabhiù indicates those who desire material objects for their personal gratification instead of for the devotional service of the Lord. The minds of such materialistic persons are suitably disturbed, and it is virtually impossible for such persons to renounce material enjoyment. This is the opinion of Çré Uddhava.</div>

<div class="Translation"> O my Lord, I myself am most foolish because my consciousness is merged in the material body and bodily relations, which are all manufactured by Your illusory energy. Thus I am thinking, "I am this body, and all of these relatives are mine." Therefore, my Lord, please instruct Your poor servant. Please tell me how I can very easily carry out Your instructions.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> It is very difficult to give up false identification with the material body, and thus we remain attached to our so-called bodily relations such as wife, children, friends, and so on. Bodily attachment causes intense pain within the heart, and we are stunned by lamentation and hankering. Çré Uddhava, a pure devotee of the Lord, here speaks like an ordinary person showing how to pray to the Personality of Godhead. We practically see that many sinful persons enter the International Society for Krishna Consciousness and after preliminary purification become most repentant for their previous illicit activities. They are shocked when they realize how they gave up the personal association of God to pursue the useless forms created by mäyä; therefore they wholeheartedly pray to the spiritual master and Lord Kåñëa to be engaged eternally in transcendental devotional service. Such a repentant, eager mentality is most auspicious for spiritual advancement. The Lord certainly answers the prayers of a repentant devotee desperate to escape the clutches of illusion.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> My dear Lord, You are the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and You reveal Yourself to Your devotees. Besides Your Lordship, I do not see anyone who can actually explain perfect knowledge to me. Such a perfect teacher is not to be found even among the demigods in heaven. Indeed, all of the demigods, headed by Lord Brahmä, are bewildered by Your illusory potency. They are conditioned souls who accept their own material bodies and bodily expansions to be the highest truth.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> All conditioned souls, from Lord Brahmä down to the insignificant ant, are declared by Çré Uddhava to be covered by material bodies produced by the illusory potency of the Lord. The demigods in heaven, being absorbed in universal management, constantly utilize their fabulous material potencies. They therefore gradually fix their minds upon their mystically empowered bodies and also upon their bodily expansions such as their celestial wives, children, co-workers and friends. In the course of life in the heavenly planets, the demigods become conditioned to think in terms of material good and bad, and thus they accept the immediate welfare of their bodies to be the highest goal of life.</div>
<div class="First"> The demigods do, however, try to strictly follow the laws of God. And to help them do this, the Supreme Lord descends to remind the heavenly beings of His own supreme personality, which possesses powers infinitely exceeding theirs. Lord Viñëu has an eternal body, full of bliss, knowledge and unlimited variegated potencies, whereas the demigods possess only deluxe material forms, subject to birth, death, old age and disease.</div>
<div class="First"> Because the demigods are attached to ruling the created universe, their devotion to God is tinged with material desires. They are therefore attracted to those portions of Vedic knowledge that award the various material opulences necessary for perpetuating their celestial life. Çré Uddhava, however, being a pure devotee of the Lord, is determined to go back home, back to Godhead, for eternal life and is thus not at all interested in the sophisticated Vedic knowledge of the demigods. The material world is a gigantic prison, whose inmates are subjected to birth, death, old age and illusion, and a pure devotee has no desire to remain there even as a first-class prisoner, like the demigods. Çré Uddhava desires to return to the kingdom of God and for this reason directly approaches the Personality of Godhead. The Lord is sva-dåçaù, or one who reveals Himself to His devotee. Thus, only the Lord Himself or His pure devotee, who faithfully repeats the Lord's message, can take one beyond the material sky into the free atmosphere of the spiritual planets, where the liberated souls enjoy an eternal life of bliss and omniscience.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Therefore, O Lord, feeling weary of material life and tormented by its distresses, I now surrender unto You because You are the perfect master. You are the unlimited, all-knowing Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose spiritual abode in Vaikuëöha is free from all disturbances. In fact, You are known as Näräyaëa, the true friend of all living beings.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> No one can claim to be a self-made man, because everyone works with the body and mind awarded by material nature. By the laws of nature there is always anxiety in material existence, and terrible tragedies periodically harass the conditioned souls. Here Uddhava points out that only Çré Kåñëa, the Personality of Godhead, is a proper master, friend and shelter for the conditioned souls. We may be attracted by the good qualities of a particular man or demigod, but we may later discover discrepancies in that person's behavior. Therefore Kåñëa is described as anavadyam. There are no discrepancies in the personal conduct or character of the Personality of Godhead; He is eternally faultless.</div>
<div class="First"> We may faithfully serve a master, father or demigod, but when it is time for us to receive our reward for faithful service, the master may die. Therefore Lord Kåñëa is here described as ananta-päram, which indicates that He is not limited by time or space. The word anta indicates the termination of time, and pära indicates a spatial termination; therefore ananta-päram means that Lord Kåñëa is not limited by time or space and thus will always dutifully reward His faithful servants.</div>
<div class="First"> If we serve someone other than the Personality of Godhead, our so-called master may forget our service or become ungrateful. Therefore Lord Kåñëa is described here as sarva-jïam, omniscient. He can never forget the service of His devotee, and therefore He is never ungrateful. In fact, it is said that Lord Kåñëa does not remember the faults of His devotees but only the sincere service they have rendered.</div>
<div class="First"> A further disadvantage in serving anyone besides Kåñëa is that when we are in danger our master may not be able to protect us. If we take shelter of our nation, that nation may be destroyed in war. If we take shelter of our family, they may also die. And as described in the Vedic literature, even the demigods are sometimes defeated by the demons. But since Lord Kåñëa is described here as éçvara, or the supreme controller, there is no danger of His being overcome or even impeded by any other power. Thus Lord Kåñëa's promise of protection to His devotee is eternally valid.</div>
<div class="First"> If we do not serve the Personality of Godhead, we will not know the ultimate result of our service. But here Lord Kåñëa is described as akuëöha-vikuëöha-dhiñëyam. Lord Kåñëa has an eternal abode called Vaikuëöha, and that abode is never disturbed by anything. The faithful servants of Lord Kåñëa will certainly go back to Godhead, back home, for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge in the personal abode of the Lord. However, since even the demigods, and what to speak of insignificant human beings, are subject sooner or later to annihilation, what ultimate benefit can be derived from serving them?</div>
<div class="First"> Uddhava describes his personal situation as nirviëëa-dhéù and våjinäbhitaptaù. In other words, Çré Uddhava states that he is exhausted and discouraged by the contradictions and anguish of material life. He has been forced, therefore, to become humble and surrender to the lotus feet of Kåñëa, the personal friend of every living entity. In the material world a great man does not have time for insignificant men. But although the Lord is the greatest person, He sits in the heart of every living entity; thus He is the most merciful. Lord Kåñëa is the ultimate shelter of even Nära, or the Lord's puruña expansion who creates the material world. The living entity is called nara, and the source of his material situation is Nära, or Mahä-Viñëu. The word näräyaëa indicates that even Mahä-Viñëu finds His shelter in Kåñëa, who is certainly supreme. Although our consciousness is presently contaminated by sinful propensities, if we follow the example of Çré Uddhava and take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, everything can be rectified. Taking shelter of Kåñëa means taking shelter of devotional service to Kåñëa and obeying Him. Lord Kåñëa demands this in Bhagavad-gétä, and if we comply with the order of the Lord our life can become fully auspicious and successful. Sooner than we expect, we may, by Kåñëa's mercy, enter the kingdom of God for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> The Supreme Lord replied: Generally those human beings who can expertly analyze the actual situation of the material world are able to raise themselves beyond the inauspicious life of gross material gratification.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çré Uddhava expressed to the Lord in the previous verses his fallen condition and his entanglement in the material concept of life. Now Lord Kåñëa reassures Uddhava that even persons far less qualified than Uddhava are able to extricate themselves from the inauspicious life of material sense gratification. According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, even if one has not received the instruction of a bona fide spiritual master, one can understand by direct and indirect analysis that the material world is not a place of enjoyment. Direct analysis means one's personal experience and indirect analysis means hearing and reading of the experience of others.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, Lord Kåñëa considered Uddhava to be more intelligent than even the demigods in heaven. Uddhava, however, was feeling discouraged, thinking himself unqualified to render devotional service to the Lord. But Uddhava was actually perfectly situated because he had achieved Lord Kåñëa as his personal spiritual master. Similarly, the members of the Kåñëa consciousness movement are guided by the instructions of the Society's founder-äcärya, Oà Viñëupäda Paramahaàsa Parivräjakäcärya Añöottara-çata Çré Çrémad A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda. Therefore, a sincere member of the Kåñëa consciousness movement should never feel discouraged but should rather count his blessings and do the needful to go back home, back to Godhead. Within the material world, certain activities are auspicious and produce happiness, whereas other activities, being sinful, are inauspicious and cause unlimited suffering. Even one who has not yet received the complete mercy of the bona fide Kåñëa conscious spiritual master should conclude by sharp intelligence that there is no happiness in ordinary, material life and that real self-interest lies beyond the material platform.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Madhväcärya points out that even if one is expert not only in material knowledge but also in spiritual knowledge, one will enter into the darkness of ignorance if one neglects the association of the devotees of the Lord. Therefore, one should not misinterpret this verse in a way that minimizes the significance of the pure devotee spiritual master. One who is vicakñaëäù, or expert, will eventually come to understand the difference between matter and spirit. Such a person will certainly recognize and appreciate a genuine spiritual master. One who is advanced in knowledge undoubtedly becomes humble, and thus an expert advanced human will never neglect the lotus feet of the pure devotees of the Lord.</div>

<div class="First"> As illustrated in this chapter by the conversation between King Yadu and the avadhüta, a sensitive, reasonable person can acquire real knowledge and happiness simply by carefully observing the world around him. By observing the happiness and distress of other living entities, one can understand what is beneficial and what is destructive.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Jéva Gosvämé states in this connection, gurv-anusaraëe pravartaka ity arthaù: the knowledge acquired by one's own perception and intelligence leads one to appreciate the value of the representative of Lord Kåñëa. The word çreyas in this verse indicates that one can advance in life through one's own intelligence. By good association one should gradually come to understand one's eternal position as servant of Kåñëa, and then one becomes very eager to live in the company of other enlightened persons. Birds of a feather flock together. The symptom of an enlightened servant of Kåñëa is that he is eager for the company of other such great souls. Thus by one's sensitive and rational observation of this material world, one should come to appreciate the value of spiritual life in the association of the devotees.</div>

<div class="First"> We find the following statement in the Vedas: puruñatve cävistaräm ätmä sahita-prajïänena sampanna-tamo vijïätaà vadati vijïätaà paçyati veda çvastanaà veda lokälokau martyenämåtam épsaty evaà sampanno 'thetareñäà paçünäm äsanä-pipäse eväbhijïänam. "In the human form of life, the soul is fully endowed with intelligence to understand spiritual knowledge. Thus, in human life the soul may speak realized knowledge, see the truth, know the future and also understand the reality both of this world and of the next. Taking advantage of the experience of mortal life, the soul in human form may endeavor for immortality, and the human body is fully equipped to achieve this end. In such an elevated state the soul is certainly well acquainted with the ordinary activities of animals, such as eating and drinking." The human form of life (puruñatve) is very significant because it affords us the opportunity to perfect our existence. The Säìkhya system mentioned here is best illustrated by the instructions of Lord Kapila to His mother, Devahüti. Lord Kapila is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and His mother</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">approached Him, saying,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nirviëëä nitaräà bhümann</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">asad-indriya-tarñaëät</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yena sambhävyamänena</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">prapannändhaà tamaù prabho</div>
<div class="First"> "I am very sick of the disturbance caused by my material senses, for because of this sense disturbance, my Lord, I have fallen into the abyss of ignorance." (SB 3.25.7) Lord Kapila delivered to His mother a highly analytical summary of all material and spiritual reality. It is significant that Lord Kapila did not discriminate against His mother because she was a woman, nor did He consider her incapable of understanding the most elaborate spiritual knowledge. Thus, in a Kåñëa conscious society of liberated souls, any man, woman or child may become a great devotee of Lord Kåñëa without discrimination. It is also significant that in the highly intellectual Säìkhya system enunciated by Lord Kapila, the solid conclusion is surrender to the lotus feet of the pure devotees and love of Godhead. In Lord Kapila's instructions in the Third Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, He emphasizes the need to take shelter of the pure devotees of the Lord. In the present verse Lord Kåñëa says, säìkhya-yoga-viçäradäù: those who are expert in taking shelter of the pure devotees and who can thus understand the actual situation of this world are able to see Kåñëa in His personal form, along with His internal and external potencies.</div>
<div class="First"> A spiritual master becomes bona fide by his full surrender to his spiritual master; but as explained in this chapter, one may also act as his own guru. This means that an intelligent and perceptive person can understand the nature of this world and his own limitations. Such a person then becomes very much inclined to associate with the pure devotees of the Lord and to receive the mercy of those who are advanced in Kåñëa consciousness. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, säìkhya-yoga, as described here, refers to the rigorous intellectual progress of the jïäna-yoga system, along with the devotion of bhakti-yoga, which emphasizes the mercy of the lotus feet of the pure devotees.</div>
<div class="First"> Actually, jïäna-yoga is a factor in the bhakti-yoga system, since Kåñëa is jïäna-gamya, or the goal of all knowledge. The Lord also says in Bhagavad-gétä (10.10) that He personally enlightens a sincere devotee with all knowledge. In this chapter, Lord Kåñëa is training Uddhava to see the Lord's personal form in the course of his daily experiences in the material world. The Lord has already indicated to Uddhava that he will travel throughout the world in samädhi, or trance, and now Lord Kåñëa is preparing Uddhava to travel as a true sannyäsé seeing the Personality of Godhead everywhere.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the word yuktäù in this verse indicates those engaged in the regulative practice of bhakti-yoga. The devotees of the Lord do not abandon their intelligence and become mindless fanatics, as some fools think. As indicated by the words anumänataù and guëair liìgaiù, a devotee engaged in bhakti-yoga intensely searches out the Personality of Godhead through all of the rational faculties of the human brain. The word mågayanti, or "searching," does not, however, indicate an unregulated or unauthorized process. If we are searching for the telephone number of a particular person, we look in the authorized telephone directory. Similarly, if we are searching for a particular product, we go to a specialized store where we are likely to find what we are looking for. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé points out that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not a product of the imagination, and thus we cannot whimsically imagine what the Lord might be. Therefore, to gain information about Lord Kåñëa, one must conduct a regulated search in the authorized Vedic scriptures. The word agrähyam in this verse indicates that no one can achieve or understand Lord Kåñëa by ordinary speculation or through the activities of the material senses. In this regard Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé states the following verse in the Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu (1.2.234):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ataù çré-kåñëa-nämädi</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na bhaved grähyam indriyaiù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sevonmukhe hi jihvädau</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">svayam eva sphuraty adaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">[Cc. Madhya 17.136]</div>
<div class="First"> "No one can understand the transcendental nature of the name, form, quality and pastimes of Çré Kåñëa through his materially contaminated senses. Only when one becomes spiritually saturated by transcendental service to the Lord are the transcendental name, form, quality and pastimes of the Lord revealed to him."</div>
<div class="First"> The words gåhyamäëair guëaiù indicate the rational and intellectual faculties of the human brain. All of these can be used to directly and indirectly perceive the Personality of Godhead. Indirectly one may experience the Lord through His creation. Since we are experiencing this world through our intelligence (and senses), we may conclude that our own intelligence must have a creator and that creator is therefore supremely intelligent. Thus, through simple logic any sane person can understand that there is a Supreme Personality of Godhead who is controlling everything. One may also directly perceive the Lord through chanting and hearing His holy names and glories. Çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù [SB 7.5.23] means that one should always chant and hear of the glories of the Lord. One who perfectly hears and chants will undoubtedly see the Lord face to face. Lord Kåñëa is all-pervading, and one should search for Him everywhere. By the transcendental senses, purified by bhakti-yoga, one may directly perceive the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As indicated by the word addhä in this verse, this perception is direct and not imaginary. This point has been elaborately explained by Çréla Prabhupäda in his purport to this verse from Çrémad-Bhägavatam (2.2.35):</div>

<div class="First"> An intelligent person should understand that if there is an eternal soul different from the body, then real happiness must lie in our eternal situation, beyond the bondage of material nature. However, ordinary persons, even when discussing spiritual subject matters, generally desire to become famous or to increase their wealth and duration of life by such spiritual practices. Most common people think, for example, that the yoga system is meant for improving one's health, that one may pray to God for money, and that one's spiritual knowledge is meant for increasing one's prestige in society. Mahäräja Yadu wants to clarify that the young brähmaëa avadhüta is not like ordinary persons and that he is actually on a spiritual platform, as will be explained in the following verses.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Ignorant persons often think that renounced spiritual life is meant for those who are impotent or homely or incompetent in practical worldly affairs. Sometimes foolish people say that religious life is a crutch for those who are not expert enough to achieve a high status in society. Therefore King Yadu has described the qualities of the mendicant brähmaëa in order to show that the brähmaëa has taken to renounced spiritual life in spite of great potential for worldly success. The avadhüta brähmaëa is described as being expert, learned, good-looking, eloquent and in every sense qualified to be a great material success. Still, the avadhüta has renounced material life and taken to Kåñëa consciousness. Going back home, back to Godhead, for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge is the real work of a human being.</div>
<div class="First"> The followers of Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu simultaneously cultivate their own Kåñëa consciousness and strenuously endeavor in missionary work to help others become Kåñëa conscious. Often foolish persons deride the devotees by saying, "Why don't you get a job?" They think that one who is sincerely endeavoring for spiritual enlightenment and who is also enlightening others is not doing anything practical. Foolish materialists will pay millions of dollars to extend their lives by a few weeks or months in a hospital, but they do not appreciate someone endeavoring for eternal life. There is no actual logic in material life. The act of trying to enjoy without Kåñëa is in itself the culmination of irrationality, and thus we cannot expect to find anything ultimately rational or logical in a materialistic life devoid of Kåñëa consciousness. Many devotees of Kåñëa come from wealthy, learned and influential families, and they take to Kåñëa consciousness in order to perfect their lives, and certainly not due to lack of opportunity for material advancement. Although sometimes persons in material distress approach the Supreme Lord for help in material life, a real devotee of Lord Kåñëa voluntarily gives up all types of material enjoyment, knowing that nothing but love of Kåñëa and service to His lotus feet are the actual perfection of life.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Although all people within the material world are burning in the great forest fire of lust and greed, you remain free and are not burned by that fire. You are just like an elephant who takes shelter from a forest fire by standing within the water of the Ganges River,</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The natural result of transcendental bliss is described in this verse. The young brähmaëa was physically very attractive, and his senses were full of potency for material enjoyment, yet he was not at all affected by material lust. This position is called mukti, or liberation.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura explains that within the Ganges flow great currents of water, capable of extinguishing a blazing fire. If an elephant maddened by sex desire stands within the Ganges, its powerful, cooling currents extinguish his lust, and the elephant becomes pacified. Similarly, ordinary human beings trapped in the cycle of birth and death are constantly harassed by the enemies of lust and greed, which never allow the mind to be completely peaceful. But if, following the example of the elephant, one situates oneself within the cooling waves of transcendental bliss, then all material desire will soon be extinguished, and one will become çänta, or peaceful. As described in Sr Caitanya-caritämåta, kåñëa-bhakta niñkäma ataeva çänta [Cc. Madhya 19.149]. Thus, everyone should take to the movement of Caitanya Mahäprabhu and cleanse himself in the cooling waters of Kåñëa consciousness, our real, eternal consciousness.</div>

<div class="First"> The word kevalätmanaù is significant here. Unless one has practical realization of the Supreme Soul and the individual soul, who reside together within the heart of every living being, it is very difficult to artificially adopt the sannyäsa order of life and travel without the association of wife, children or other family members. The nature of every living being is to make friends with others and to offer his love to a suitable person. One who has realized the Supreme Person is satisfied to always carry the Personality of Godhead within his heart as his constant companion. Unless one has realized that Kåñëa is one's only true friend and that Kåñëa is within one's heart, one will remain attached to the temporary relationships of the material world.</div>

<div class="First"> The word buddhy-upäçritäù in this verse indicates that the brähmaëa's spiritual masters did not directly speak to him. Instead, he learned from them by his intelligence. All living entities who are inimical to Lord Kåñëa glorify useless material things and spend their lives trying to lord it over the material objects they falsely worship. Thus the conditioned souls try to increase their duration of life, as well as their fame and beauty, by means of mundane religiosity, economic development and gross sense gratification. King Yadu noticed that the saintly avadhüta did not behave like that. Therefore the King was inquisitive to find out the actual situation of the brähmaëa. In reply to the King the saintly brähmaëa states, "I do not consider the twenty-four elements of the physical world as objects of my sense gratification, and therefore I don't consider accepting or rejecting them. Rather, I accept the material elements as my instructing spiritual masters. Thus, even though wandering throughout the material world, I am never bereft of service to the guru. Taking shelter of steady intelligence, I travel about the earth constantly engaged on the transcendental platform. By intelligence I transcend useless desires, and my ultimate goal is the loving devotional service of the Lord. Now I shall explain to you about my twenty-four spiritual masters."</div>

<div class="First"> Great mountains bear unlimited quantities of earth, which in turn give sustenance to innumerable forms of life such as trees, grass, birds, animals, and so on. Mountains also pour forth unlimited quantities of crystalline water in the form of waterfalls and rivers, and this water gives life to all. By studying the example of mountains, one should learn the art of providing for the happiness of all living entities. Similarly, one may take excellent lessons from the pious trees, who offer innumerable benefits, such as fruits, flowers, cooling shade and medicinal extracts. Even when a tree is suddenly cut down and dragged away, the tree does not protest but continues to give service to others in the form of firewood. Thus, one should become the disciple of such magnanimous trees and learn from them the qualities of saintly conduct. According to Çréla Madhväcärya, the word parärthaikänta-sambhavaù indicates that one should dedicate all of one's wealth and other assets to the welfare of others. By one's acquired opulence, one should especially try to please the spiritual master and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus, the demigods, as well as all truly respectable superior personalities, will automatically be pleased. By developing saintly conduct, as described in this verse, one will become tolerant, and this will free one from the useless agitation of the material senses, which drive one to wander throughout the world searching in vain for material happiness. Lord Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu has also emphasized the tree's quality of tolerance: taror iva sahiñëunä, kértanéyaù sadä hariù [Cc. Ädi 17.31]. One who is as tolerant as a tree can chant the holy name of Kåñëa constantly, finding ever-new satisfaction.</div>

<div class="Translation"> A learned sage should take his satisfaction in the simple maintenance of his existence and should not seek satisfaction through gratifying the material senses. In other words, one should care for the material body in such a way that one's higher knowledge is not destroyed and so that one's speech and mind are not deviated from self-realization.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> A wise man does not absorb his consciousness in the forms, flavors, aromas and sensations of material sense gratification, but rather accepts activities such as eating and sleeping simply to keep body and soul together. One must properly maintain one's body by regulated activities of eating, sleeping, cleansing, etc., otherwise the mind will become weak, and one's spiritual knowledge will fade away. If one eats too austerely, or if in the name of selflessness one accepts impure food, surely one loses control of the mind. On the other hand, if one eats food that is excessively fatty or rich there will be an unwanted increase in sleep and semen, and thus the mind and speech will be overwhelmed by the modes of passion and ignorance. Lord Kåñëa has summarized the whole matter in Bhagavad-gétä by His statement yuktähära-vihärasya yukta-ceñöasya karmasu. One should moderately and intelligently regulate all of one's bodily activities so that they are favorable for self-realization. This technique is taught by the bona fide spiritual master. If one is too austere or if one engages too much in sense gratification, self-realization is impossible.</div>
<div class="First"> It is the duty of a devotee of the Lord to avoid seeing any object as separate from Kåñëa, because that is illusion. A gentleman will never try to enjoy the property of another gentleman. Similarly, if one sees everything in relation to Kåñëa, there is no scope for material sense gratification. But if one sees material objects as separate from Kåñëa, then one's material enjoying propensity is immediately aroused. A human being must be intelligent enough to distinguish between preyas, or temporary gratification, and çreyas, permanent benefit. One may accept sense activity in a regulated, limited fashion so that one will be strong for serving Kåñëa, but if one excessively indulges the material senses, one will lose one's gravity and seriousness in spiritual life and act like an ordinary materialist. The ultimate goal, as stated here, is jïänam, or steady consciousness of the Absolute Truth, Lord Kåñëa.</div>

<div class="First"> The wind is the external manifestation of air, whereas präëa is the internal manifestation. When the wind passes over waterfalls it carries sprinkles of clear water and thus becomes most refreshing. Sometimes the wind blows through a beautiful forest, carrying the fragrances of fruits and flowers; at other times the wind may fuel a fire that burns the same forest to ashes. The wind, however, being fixed in its own nature, remains neutral in both its auspicious and inauspicious activities. Similarly, within this material world we will inevitably face both pleasing and disgusting situations. If, however, we remain fixed in Kåñëa consciousness, we will not be disturbed by the inauspicious, nor will we become attached to the materially auspicious. In the course of his spiritual duties, a devotee sometimes finds himself chanting Hare Kåñëa in a beautiful country atmosphere, and sometimes he finds himself doing the same thing in a hellish city. In both cases the devotee fixes his mind upon Lord Kåñëa and experiences transcendental bliss. Although the wind passes through the most dark and forbidding places, the wind is not frightened or disturbed. Similarly, a devotee of Lord Kåñëa should never be fearful or anxious, even when in the most difficult situation. One who is attached to materially pleasing forms, tastes, smells, sounds and touches will also be repelled by the opposite in each category. Thus finding himself surrounded by innumerable good and bad things, the materialist is constantly disturbed. When the wind blows in many directions at once, the atmosphere becomes agitated. Similarly, if the mind is constantly attracted and repelled by material objects there will be such mental disturbance that it will be impossible to think of the Absolute Truth. Therefore, one should learn from the blowing wind the art of moving throughout the material world without attachment.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Although a self-realized soul may live in various material bodies while in this world, experiencing their various qualities and functions, he is never entangled, just as the wind which carries various aromas does not actually mix with them.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Although we experience the wind as fragrant or foul, depending on the aromas it carries, the wind does not in fact change its actual nature. Similarly, although we regard a particular person as strong or weak, intelligent or retarded, beautiful or homely, good or bad, the pure spirit soul, who is the actual person, does not really possess any of the qualities of the body but is merely covered by them, just as the wind is covered by different aromas. Thus, a Kåñëa conscious person is always aware that he is different from the temporary body. He experiences the various transformations of the body, such as childhood, adolescence, adulthood and old age; but although he experiences the pains, pleasures, qualities and functions of that body, a Kåñëa conscious person never thinks that he is the body. He always understands that he is an eternal spirit soul, part and parcel of Lord Kåñëa. As stated in this verse, na yujyate yogé: he is not entangled. The conclusion is that one should never consider a Kåñëa conscious person in terms of bodily designation, but should see him as an eternal servitor of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> A thoughtful sage, even while living within a material body, should understand himself to be pure spirit soul. Similarly, one should see that the spirit soul enters within all forms of life, both moving and nonmoving, and that the individual souls are thus all-pervading. The sage should further observe that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as the Supersoul, is simultaneously present within all things. Both the individual soul and the Supersoul can be understood by comparing them to the nature of the sky: although the sky extends everywhere and everything rests within the sky, the sky does not mix with anything, nor can it be divided by anything.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Although air exists within the sky, the sky, or space, is different from air. Even in the absence of air, space or sky is present. All material objects are situated within space, or within the vast material sky, but the sky remains undivided and, although accommodating all objects, never actually mixes with anything. In the same way one can understand the situation of both the individual soul and the Supersoul. The individual soul is all-pervading, because there are innumerable jévätmäs, which enter within all things; yet, as confirmed in Vedic literature, each individual ätmä remains infinitesimal.

<div class="First"> "There are innumerable particles of spiritual atoms, which are measured as one ten-thousandth of the upper portion of the hair."</div>
<div class="First"> The Supreme Personality of Godhead, however. is all-pervading because He Himself is personally present everywhere. The Lord is known as advaita, or indivisible. Thus the same unique Personality of Godhead exists everywhere, just like the sky, and yet is not attached to anything, although everything is resting within Him. The Lord Himself has confirmed this analysis of His all-pervasiveness in Bhagavad-gétä (9.6):</div>

The Lord is always supreme, and one who is actually a thoughtful sage never doubts the supreme position of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Although the mighty wind blows clouds and storms across the sky, the sky is never implicated or affected by these activities. Similarly, the spirit soul is not actually changed or affected by contact with the material nature. Although the living entity enters within a body made of earth, water and fire, and although he is impelled by the three modes of nature created by eternal time, his eternal spiritual nature is never actually affected.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Although the sky appears to be affected by the mighty movements of wind, rain, hurricanes, lightning and thunder, etc., the sky, being very subtle, is actually not affected, but is rather the background for such visible activities. Similarly, although the material body and mind undergo innumerable changes, such as birth and death, happiness and distress, love and hate, the eternal living entity is merely the background for such activities. The spirit soul, being most subtle, is not actually affected; only due to misidentification with the superficial activities of the body and mind does the soul undergo terrible distress within the material world.</div>
<div class="First"> In this regard, Çréla Madhväcärya has pointed out that the individual living entity must struggle to revive his divine spiritual qualities. The living entity is part and parcel of the supreme entity, called Kåñëa, and as such the individual soul is also a reservoir of godly qualities. The Personality of Godhead, however, automatically manifests these qualities without any hindrance, whereas the conditioned soul must struggle to revive such qualities. Thus, although both the Personality of Godhead and the personality of the living entity are eternal and transcendental, the Personality of Godhead is always supreme. By realizing all this with clear intelligence, the conditioned soul can rise to the spiritual platform.</div>

<div class="Translation"> O King, a saintly person is just like water because he is free from all contamination, gentle by nature, and by speaking creates a beautiful vibration like that of flowing water. Just by seeing, touching or hearing such a saintly person, the living entity is purified, just as one is cleansed by contact with pure water. Thus a saintly person, just like a holy place, purifies all those who contact him because he always chants the glories of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The words apäà mitram, "just like water," can also be read as aghän mitram, which means that a saintly person purifies all living entities by accepting them as mitram, or his personal friends, and saves them from their sinful reactions (aghät). The conditioned living entity falsely identifies with his gross material body and subtle mind and thus falls from the platform of spiritual knowledge. A conditioned living being is always lusty for material sense gratification, and if he does not acquire it, he becomes angry. Sometimes he is so obsessed with fear of losing his material gratification that he enters a stage approaching madness.</div>
<div class="First"> A saintly person, however, is like pure water, free from all contamination and capable of purifying all things. Just as pure water is transparent, a saintly person transparently manifests the Personality of Godhead within his heart. Such love of Godhead is the reservoir of all happiness. Water makes a most pleasing vibration as it flows and cascades, and similarly the sound vibration of the Lord's pure devotee, who is saturated with the glories of the Lord, is most charming and beautiful. Thus, by studying the nature of water one can understand the symptoms of a pure devotee of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Saintly persons become powerful by execution of austerities. Their consciousness is unshakable because they do not try to enjoy anything within the material world. Such naturally liberated sages accept foodstuffs that are offered to them by destiny, and if by chance they happen to eat contaminated food, they are not affected, just like fire, which burns up contaminated substances that are offered to it.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word udara-bhäjana indicates that a saintly person eats only to keep body and soul together and not for sense gratification. One should eat palatable foodstuffs to maintain one's mind in a cheerful mood; however, one should not eat luxuriously, because this will cause sex desire and laziness. A saintly person is always a perfect gentleman and is never greedy or lusty. Although mäyä tries to defeat him by offering different material allurements, ultimately these attractive material features are themselves defeated by the spiritual power of a saintly person. Thus one should never disrespect a spiritually advanced personality but should worship him reverentially. To carelessly approach a Kåñëa conscious personality is just like carelessly approaching fire, which immediately burns if not handled properly. The Lord does not excuse mistreatment of a pure devotee.</div>

<div class="First"> A saintly person prefers to conceal his exalted spiritual position, but to instruct the suffering people of the world he sometimes reveals his own greatness. This is compared to a fire that sometimes burns unnoticed beneath ashes and sometimes blazes openly. Just as fire devours the ghee and other offerings given by the performers of sacrifice, similarly a saintly person accepts the praise offered by his conditioned followers, knowing that in fact all praise is meant for the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa. Although an ordinary person immediately becomes puffed up and foolish when he is praised, such inauspicious tendencies within a saintly person are burned to ashes by his attachment to the Absolute Truth. In this way, he is just like fire.</div>

<div class="First"> Although the Supreme Lord is within everything, everything is not the Lord. By the mode of goodness the Lord creates the exalted material bodies of demigods and brähmaëas, and by expanding the mode of ignorance He similarly creates the bodies of animals, çüdras and other lower forms of life. The Lord enters all of these superior and inferior creations, but He remains vibhu, the all-powerful Personality of Godhead. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains that although fire is present within smoldering wood, it blazes forth when we stir the wood around. Similarly, although the Personality of Godhead is indirectly present everywhere, when we chant and hear His glories with love and devotion the Lord is stirred into manifestation and directly appears before His devotees.</div>

<div class="First"> The body undergoes six changes: birth, growth, maintenance, production of by-products, dwindling and death. Similarly, the moon appears to grow, diminish and finally disappear. Since moonlight is a lunar reflection of sunlight, it is understood that the moon itself does not grow or diminish; rather, we perceive the reflection of the moon in various phases. Similarly, the eternal soul is not born, nor does it die, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä (2.20): na jäyate mriyate vä kadäcit. We perceive the reflection of the soul in the form of the gross material body and the subtle mind, which undergo various material changes.</div>

<div class="First"> The brähmaëa avadhüta instructing King Yadu again gives the example of fire after having already proceeded to the example of the moon. This analytic method is called siàhävalokana, or "the lion's glance," by which one simultaneously proceeds forward and casts backward glances to see if anything has been overlooked. Thus the sage proceeds with his analysis but returns to the example of fire to illustrate the need for renunciation. The material body is certainly an ephemeral and phantasmagorical manifestation of the Lord's external potency. The flames of a fire constantly take birth and disappear, yet we perceive the fire as a continuous reality. Similarly, the soul is a continuous reality, although his material bodies appear and disappear constantly, by the influence of time. It is said that the most astonishing thing is that no one thinks that they will die. Because the soul is eternal, the living entity is prone to accept any fleeting situation as permanent, forgetting that his eternal nature can be truly experienced only in the eternal atmosphere of the spiritual sky. If one is convinced of this fact, he develops the quality of vairägya, or detachment from material illusion.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Even when reflected in various objects, the sun is never divided, nor does it merge into its reflection. Only those with dull brains would consider the sun in this way. Similarly, although the soul is reflected through different material bodies, the soul remains undivided and nonmaterial.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The sun is reflected in many objects, such as windows, mirrors, shiny metal, oil, water, and so on, yet the sun remains one and indivisible. Similarly, the eternal spirit soul within the body is reflected through the screen of the material body. Thus the soul appears to be old or young, fat or skinny, happy or sad. The soul may appear to be American, Russian, African, Hindu or Christian; however, the eternal soul in its natural position is free of any material designation.</div>
<div class="First"> The word sthüla-matibhiù in this verse indicates those whose intelligence is gross and dull. We have practical experience of a dog urinating on a valuable painting at an outdoor art show. Due to its dull intelligence, the dog could not appreciate the actual value of the painting. Similarly, unless one takes to Kåñëa consciousness, one is grossly misusing the invaluable opportunity of human life. Human life is meant for self-realization, and we should not waste time bickering over material designations such as capitalist, communist, American, Russian, and so on. Instead, all people should take to the loving devotional service of God and realize their eternal, pure identity. One should understand the sun by observing its direct manifestation and not its distorted reflection on material objects. Similarly, one should consider every living being in terms of his pure spiritual identity beyond the distorted manifestation of material designations.</div>
<div class="First"> The word ätmä in this verse also refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Just as we tend to observe ordinary jéva souls through the reflection of the material body, we tend to observe the Personality of Godhead through the distorting screen of our material mind. Thus, we imagine God to be impersonal or material or unknowable. When the sky is overcast, sunlight is the highest possible perception of the sun, which is covered by clouds. Similarly, when one's mind is fogged over with mental speculation one may take the light emanating from the transcendental body of God to be the highest spiritual truth. However, when the mind is spotlessly clear like a cloudless blue sky, one can see the actual form of the Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa. The Absolute Truth cannot be perfectly understood by the covered mind of the conditioned soul; rather, one must see the Lord through the clear blue sky of pure Kåñëa consciousness, which is free from fruitive desires and mental speculation.

One must become a pure devotee of Lord Kåñëa, and then his knowledge will illuminate everything in all directions: yasmin vijïäte sarvam evam vijïätaà bhavati (Muëòaka Upaniñad 1.3).</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> One should never indulge in excessive affection or concern for anyone or anything; otherwise one will have to experience great suffering, just like the foolish pigeon.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The Sanskrit prefix ati, or "excessive," indicates affection or attachment in which there is no Kåñëa consciousness. Lord Kåñëa says in Bhagavad-gétä (5.29), suhådaà sarva-bhütänäm: the Lord is the eternal well-wisher of every living being. The Lord is so affectionate that He sits in the heart of every conditioned soul and accompanies him throughout his endless wandering in the kingdom of mäyä, patiently waiting for the conditioned soul to come back home, back to Godhead. Thus the Lord makes all arrangements for the eternal happiness of every living entity. The best way for anyone to show compassion and affection for all living beings is to become a preacher on behalf of Lord Kåñëa and assist the Lord in reclaiming the fallen souls. If our affection or attachment for others is based on bodily sense gratification, in the name of society, friendship and love, that excessive, unwanted affection (ati-sneha) will cause burning pain at the time of the breaking or destruction of the relationship. Now the story of the foolish pigeon will be narrated. A similar story is described in the Seventh Canto, Second Chapter of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, told by Yamaräja to the mourning widows of King Suyajïa.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The two pigeons were very much devoted to their household duties. Their hearts being tied together by sentimental affection, they were each attracted by the other's glances, bodily features and states of mind. Thus, they completely bound each other in affection.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The male and female pigeon were so attracted to each other that they could not tolerate even a moment's separation from one another. This is called bhagavad-vismåti, or forgetfulness of the Supreme Lord and attachment to dead matter. The living entity has an eternal love for the Lord, but when perverted, that love is manifested as false material affection. A pale reflection of actual pleasure thus becomes the foundation of a false life based on forgetfulness of the Absolute Truth.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word tarpayanté indicates that the lady pigeon was quite expert in seducing her husband through smiling glances and loving talks. Thus appealing to his noble sentiments, she efficiently engaged him as her faithful servant. The poor pigeon was ajitendriya, or one who cannot control his senses and whose heart is easily melted by the beauty of a woman. The brähmaëa avadhüta is giving valuable instructions by narrating this story of the two pigeons and the terrible distress they suffered by inevitable separation. If one's intelligence is not dedicated to serving Håñékeça, the Supreme Lord of sense activity, undoubtedly one will plunge into the nescience of bodily gratification. Then one becomes no better than a foolish pigeon.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Çrédhara Svämé explains that the word atåptasya indicates that the pigeon was not satisfied with the sense gratification he had achieved. Although he was completely attached to his wife, children and nest, he could not sufficiently enjoy them since there is ultimately no satisfaction in such things. Akåtärthasya indicates that his hopes and dreams for future expansion of his sense gratification were now also ruined. People commonly refer to their "home, sweet home" as their nest, and money put aside for future sense gratification is called a nest egg. Therefore, all of the love birds of the material world should clearly note how their so-called wife, children and fortune will all be dragged away in the hunter's net. In other words, death will finish everything.</div>

In this way, he should remain always engaged in the worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even if no food is available, the person who wants to engage fully in the Lord's worship should not beg; rather, he should understand this to be the arrangement of providence, thinking, "Whatever enjoyment is destined for me will automatically come, and thus I should not uselessly waste the remaining duration of my life in worrying about such things." If he does not get any food, he should simply remain lying like the python and patiently fix his mind in meditation upon the Supreme Lord. The instruction the avadhüta brähmaëa received from the ocean is that the mind of the sage who is devoted to the Personality of Godhead appears very clear and grave, just like the still ocean waters. The ocean does not overflow during the rainy season, when all the flooded rivers discharge their waters into it, nor does it dry up during the hot season, when the rivers fail to supply it. Similarly, the sage does not become elated when he achieves desirable things, nor does he become distressed in their absence.</div>
<div class="First"> The instruction of the moth is that just as he becomes enticed by the fire and gives up his life, the fool who cannot control his senses becomes enchanted by the forms of women decorated with gold ornaments and fine clothing. Chasing after these embodiments of the divine illusory energy of the Lord, he loses his life untimely and falls down into the most horrible hell. There are two kinds of bees, the bumblebee and the honeybee. The instruction learned from the bumblebee is that a sage should collect only small amounts of food from many different households and thus day after day practice the occupation of mädhukaré for maintaining his existence. A sage should also collect the essential truths from all scriptures, be they great or insignificant. The instruction received from the second insect, the honeybee, is that a mendicant sannyäsé should not save the food he begs for the sake of having it later that night or the next day, because if he does so, then just like the greedy honeybee he will be destroyed along with his hoard. From the elephant the avadhüta brähmaëa received the following instruction. Male elephants are tricked by hunters into moving toward captive female elephants, whereupon they fall into the hunters' ditch and are captured. Similarly, the man who becomes attached to the form of woman falls down into the deep well of material life and is destroyed. The instruction received from the honey thief is that just as he steals the honey collected with great effort by the honeybee, a person in the renounced order of life has the privilege of enjoying before anyone else the food and other valuable things purchased by the hard-earned money of the householders.</div>
<div class="First"> The instruction from the deer is that just as he becomes confused upon hearing the song of the hunter's flute and loses his life, so also does any person who becomes attracted to mundane music and song uselessly waste his life. The instruction learned from the fish is that because he comes under the sway of attachment to the sense of taste, he is caught on the baited fishhook and must die. Similarly, an unintelligent person who is victimized by his insatiable tongue will also end up losing his life.</div>
<div class="First"> There was once a prostitute named Piìgalä in the city of Videha, and from her the avadhüta learned another lesson. One day she dressed herself in very attractive clothing and ornaments and was waiting from sunset until midnight for a customer. She waited in great anticipation, but as the time passed her mind became very uneasy. No man came to see her, and in disgust she finally became renounced, giving up her hankering for the arrival of a suitor. Thereafter she engaged herself in thinking only of the Supreme Lord, Hari, and her mind achieved the supreme platform of peace. The instruction received from her is that hopes for sense gratification are the root cause of all suffering. Therefore, only one who has given up such hankering can fix himself in meditation upon the Personality of Godhead and achieve transcendental peace.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> The saintly brähmaëa said: O King, the embodied living entity automatically experiences unhappiness in heaven or hell. Similarly, happiness will also be experienced, even without one's seeking it. Therefore a person of intelligent discrimination does not make any endeavor to obtain such material happiness.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> One should not uselessly waste his life pursuing material sense gratification, because a specific quantity of material happiness will automatically come to one as a result of one's past and present fruitive activities. This lesson is learned from the ajagara, or python, who lies down and accepts for his maintenance whatever comes of its own accord. Remarkably, in both material heaven and hell happiness and unhappiness come automatically, due to our previous activities, although the proportions of happiness and unhappiness certainly vary. Either in heaven or in hell one may eat, drink, sleep and have sex life, but these activities, being based on the material body, are temporary and inconsequential. An intelligent person should see that even the best material situation is actually a punishment for previous unlawful activities executed outside the scope of loving devotional service to God. A conditioned soul undergoes great trouble to obtain a little happiness. After struggling in material life, which is full of hardship and hypocrisy, one may receive a little sense gratification, but this illusory pleasure in no way offsets the burden of suffering one must bear to obtain it. After all, a pretty hat is no cure for a homely face. If one really wants to solve life's problems, one should live simply and reserve the major portion of one's life for loving service to Kåñëa. Even those who do not serve God receive a certain standard of maintenance from Him; therefore we can just imagine the security the Lord affords to those who dedicate their lives to His devotional service.</div>
<div class="First"> Unrefined fruitive workers foolishly worry only about the present life, whereas more pious karmés imprudently make elaborate arrangements for future material sense gratification, unaware that all such enjoyment is temporary. The real solution, however, is to understand that by pleasing the Personality of Godhead, who is the master of all senses and all desires, one can attain permanent happiness. Such knowledge easily solves the problems of life.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> A saintly person should remain peaceful and materially inactive, maintaining his body without much endeavor. Even though possessed of full sensual, mental and physical strength, a saintly person should not become active for material gain but rather should always remain alert to his actual self-interest.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word véta-nidraù in this verse is very significant. Nidrä means "sleep" or "ignorance," and véta means "freed from." In other words, a transcendentalist should always be awake to his eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and should carefully cultivate Kåñëa consciousness. Being confident of his relationship with the Lord, he should not endeavor for his personal maintenance, knowing that the Lord is protecting him in all respects. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura states that the example of the python is given so that one will not uselessly waste his time in bodily maintenance.</div>
<div class="First"> One should not think, however, that the purpose of life is to lie on the ground like a python or to make a show of starving the body. The example of the python should not encourage one to become completely inactive. One should rather become active in spiritual advancement and inactive in material sense gratification. If one becomes completely inactive, that is certainly nidrä, or the darkness of ignorance, in which one remains asleep to his identity as an eternal servant of the Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="First"> A transcendentalist is eager to execute his service to the Lord, and therefore he is grateful when the Lord provides material facilities for such service. Mere renunciation of the material world is phalgu-vairägya, or an immature stage of spiritual understanding. One must come to the stage of yukta-vairägya, engaging everything in the service of Lord Kåñëa. It is our practical experience that a devotee absorbed in spreading Kåñëa consciousness automatically receives all facilities for his personal maintenance.</div>

<div class="Translation"> A saintly sage is happy and pleasing in his external behavior, whereas internally he is most grave and thoughtful.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Even in the midst of great distress, a self-realized sage does not lose control of himself, nor is his spiritual knowledge lost. Thus he is akñobhya, or undisturbed. His mind is fixed on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the reservoir of unlimited spiritual bliss, and having linked his consciousness with the supreme consciousness, his knowledge cannot be measured. A pure devotee, having taken shelter of the Lord's lotus feet, possesses great spiritual power, and therefore he cannot be surpassed or overwhelmed. In fact, having developed his spiritual body, he is not affected by the deteriorating actions of time. Although outwardly he is friendly and pleasing to everyone, internally his mind is fixed in the Absolute Truth, and no one can understand his actual purpose or plan. Even the most intelligent human being cannot understand the mental activities of a self-realized devotee who has given up material life based on lust and greed and taken shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord. Such a great soul can be compared to the mighty ocean. Innumerable powerful rivers plunge into the ocean, but the ocean remains calm and peaceful. Thus, a saintly person is understood to be, like the ocean, pleasing, unfathomable, grave, unsurpassable, unlimited and unshakable.</div>

<div class="Translation"> During the rainy season the swollen rivers rush into the ocean, and during the dry summer the rivers, now shallow, severely reduce their supply of water; yet the ocean does not swell up during the rainy season, nor does it dry up in the hot summer. In the same way, a saintly devotee who has accepted the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the goal of his life sometimes will receive by providence great material opulence, and sometimes he will find himself materially destitute. However, such a devotee of the Lord does not rejoice in a flourishing condition, nor is he morose when poverty-stricken.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> A sincere devotee of the Lord is always eager to meet the Lord and render Him transcendental service. He wants to remain fixed as an atom at the lotus feet of the Lord because Lord Kåñëa, or Näräyaëa, is the reservoir of all pleasure. He rejoices when experiencing pure Kåñëa consciousness and is morose when Kåñëa is not present in his mind. In his dealings with the material world, a devotee cannot be disturbed by ordinary, materialistic people who sometimes insult him and accuse him of neglecting material sense gratification, just as the ocean cannot be disturbed by the innumerable rivers that enter into it. Sometimes lusty women approach a pure devotee, and sometimes speculative philosophers try to argue against the Personality of Godhead, but with all such ordinary people, a pure devotee is detached and undisturbed in his blissful Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> One who has failed to control his senses immediately feels attraction upon seeing a woman's form, which is created by the illusory energy of the Supreme Lord. Indeed, when the woman speaks with enticing words, smiles coquettishly and moves her body sensuously, his mind is immediately captured, and thus he falls blindly into the darkness of material existence, just as the moth maddened by the fire rushes blindly into its flames.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Çrédhara Svämé explains in this regard that just as a moth is killed by its attraction to the form of fire, similarly a bee can easily be killed by exploiting its attraction to the fragrance of flowers. Furthermore, hunters may trap and kill an elephant by exploiting its sensuous desire to touch a captive female elephant and may also kill a deer by attracting it with the sounds of their horns; and a fish is killed by its desire to taste the bait on a hook. Thus, one who desires to learn detachment from material illusion should accept these five helpless creatures as guru and learn the needful. Certainly one who is lusty to enjoy the illusory form of woman will be quickly buried in material illusion. Of the five types of fatal attraction involving material sense objects, the lesson of rüpa, or form, is illustrated in this verse.</div>

<div class="Translation"> A foolish person with no intelligent discrimination is immediately aroused at the sight of a lusty woman beautifully decorated with golden ornaments, fine clothing and other cosmetic features. Being eager for sense gratification, such a fool loses all intelligence and is destroyed just like the moth who rushes into the blazing fire.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Actually, women have the power to attract men through all of the material senses. Men become lusty by seeing the body of a woman, by smelling her fragrance, by hearing her voice, by tasting her lips and by touching her body. However, the foolish relationship based on material sex attraction begins by seeing, and thus rüpa, or form, is very prominent in the process of ruining one's intelligence. This fact has been exploited in modern times by huge pornography industries, which prey on unfortunate men and women. The example of the foolish moth rushing into the fire and destroying itself is most appropriate in this regard, for one who becomes addicted to the momentary pleasure of sex indulgence certainly loses his power to understand the spiritual reality behind dull matter.</div>
<div class="First"> A lusty person becomes blind and foolish through sex indulgence, and his soul is lost in the fire of sense gratification. This whole disaster can be avoided by taking seriously to the process of chanting the holy names of the Lord: Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. Caitanya Mahäprabhu and His empowered representatives such as Çréla Prabhupäda have created a movement to save people from the dungeon of material life, and we should all seriously take advantage of this opportunity.</div>

<div class="Translation"> A saintly person should accept only enough food to keep his body and soul together. He should go from door to door accepting just a little bit of food from each family. Thus he should practice the occupation of the honeybee.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Sometimes a honeybee is attracted by the extraordinary aroma of a particular lotus flower and lingers there, neglecting his usual activity of flying from flower to flower. Unfortunately, at sunset the lotus flower closes, and thus the infatuated honeybee is trapped. Similarly, a sannyäsé or brahmacäré may discover that excellent foodstuff is available at a particular house, and therefore, instead of wandering from place to place, he may become a veritable resident of such a well-fed household. Thus he will become bewildered by the illusion of family life and fall down from the platform of renunciation. Also, if a mendicant takes unfair advantage of the Vedic custom of charity and takes too often from a single family, the resentment he causes will disturb the social order. An ideal sage should, like the honeybee, travel from place to place, but he must be careful not to become a chubby bee by going to many houses and eating sumptuously at each house. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, such a chubby bee will undoubtedly become entangled in the network of mäyä. No one should be overly attached to the gratification of his tongue, because this will lead to an overstuffed belly and then uncontrollable lust. In conclusion, one should not endeavor very much for material sense gratification but should instead endeavor strenuously to spread the glories of the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa. This is the proper use of human energy.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In human society the original knowledge is called Veda, and the essential part of veda, or knowledge, is Kåñëa consciousness. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (15.15), vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù. From the honeybee, an intelligent human being should learn to take the essence, or nectar, of all knowledge. A honeybee does not waste its time trying to carry away an entire bush or garden, but rather takes the essential nectar. We may thus study the difference between the honeybee and the ass, who carries heavy loads. Education does not mean to become an intellectual ass carrying heavy loads of useless knowledge; rather, one should accept the essential knowledge that leads to an eternal life of bliss and understanding.</div>
<div class="First"> At the present time people generally have a sectarian concept of religion, and yet there is no scientific understanding of the Absolute Truth. Such complacent, dogmatic, sectarian religionists can certainly learn something from the example of the honeybee given in this verse.</div>

<div class="Translation"> A saintly person should not think, "This food I will keep to eat tonight and this other food I can save for tomorrow." In other words, a saintly person should not store foodstuffs acquired by begging. Rather, he should use his own hands as his plate and eat whatever fits on them. His only storage container should be his belly, and whatever conveniently fits into his belly should be his stock of food. Thus one should not imitate the greedy honeybee who eagerly collects more and more honey.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> There are two types of honeybees: those who collect nectar from the flowers and those who actually manufacture honey in the beehive. This verse refers to the second class. The greedy honeybee eventually collects so much honey that he is trapped in his hive; and in the same way, a materialistic person becomes trapped under the burden of unnecessary material accumulation. One who is interested in making spiritual progress should avoid such a situation; however, Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura points out that for the purpose of spreading Kåñëa consciousness one may accumulate an unlimited amount of material opulence. This is called yukta-vairägya, or using everything in the service of Kåñëa. A saintly person who is unable to work in Lord Caitanya's mission should practice austerities and collect only what he can hold in his hands and belly. However, one who has given his life to Kåñëa may collect unlimitedly on Lord Kåñëa's behalf. In fact, without acquiring material opulence, how is it possible to spread the Kåñëa consciousness movement all over the world? But if one tries to personally enjoy the funds or facilities acquired for the missionary activities of the Kåñëa consciousness movement, he commits the greatest offense. Therefore, even in the name of Lord Kåñëa, one should collect only what he can immediately engage in practical devotional service; otherwise one will fall down to the platform of ordinary greediness.</div>

<div class="Translation"> A saintly person should never touch a young girl. In fact, he should not even let his foot touch a wooden doll in the shape of a woman. By bodily contact with a woman he will surely be captured by illusion, just as the elephant is captured by the she-elephant due to his desire to touch her body.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Elephants are captured in the jungle in the following way. A large hole is dug and then covered over with grass, leaves, mud and so on. Then a she-elephant is exhibited in front of the male elephant, who chases after her with lusty desire, falls into the hole and is captured. The lesson to be learned from the elephant is that the desire to relish the touch sensation is certainly the cause of ruining one's life. An intelligent person, noting the elephant's great propensity to sport with the she-elephant, will take this excellent example to heart. Therefore, somehow or other one should avoid being cheated by allurement to the sensuous form of woman. One should not allow one's mind to be lost in lusty dreams of sex pleasure. There are various types of sense gratification to be enjoyed between men and women, including speaking, contemplating, touching, sexual intercourse, etc., and all of these constitute the network of illusion by which one is helplessly bound like an animal. Somehow or other one should remain aloof from sense gratification in the form of sex pleasure; otherwise, there is no possibility of understanding the spiritual world.</div>

<div class="Translation"> A greedy person accumulates a large quantity of money with great struggle and pain, but the person who has struggled so much to acquire this wealth is not always allowed to enjoy it himself or give it in charity to others. The greedy man is like the bee who struggles to produce a large quantity of honey, which is then stolen by a man who will enjoy it personally or sell it to others. No matter how carefully one hides his hard-earned wealth or tries to protect it, there are those who are expert in detecting the whereabouts of valuable things, and they will steal it.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> One may argue that a wealthy man may conceal his money so expertly, by investing it in banks, stocks, properties, and so on, that there is no danger of theft. Only foolish people actually hide money by burying it in the ground or placing it under a mattress. But despite the fact that the majority of the world's wealth has been accumulated in highly developed capitalistic countries, these countries are being severely challenged by many enemies who threaten at any moment to overrun the capitalists and steal their wealth. Similarly, we often find that the children of wealthy people are kidnapped, and then their parents must pay huge ransoms. Sometimes the parents themselves may also be kidnapped. Furthermore, there are so-called investment counselors who are expert in stealing the money of rich people; and in the modern age governments have also become expert in stealing money by taxation. Thus, the word artha-vit indicates one who by hook or by crook is expert in stealing the hard-earned wealth of other people. The bees work frantically to produce honey, but they will not enjoy their honey. As Lord Kåñëa states, måtyuù sarva-haraç cäham: "I will come as death personified and steal everything." (Bg. 10.34) Somehow or other one's hard-earned material opulence will be stolen, and therefore, as mentioned in this verse, one should not work uselessly like the foolish honeybee.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Just as a hunter takes away the honey laboriously produced by the honeybees, similarly, saintly mendicants such as brahmacärés and sannyäsés are entitled to enjoy the property painstakingly accumulated by householders dedicated to family enjoyment.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The scriptures state, "Saintly mendicants in the sannyäsa order of life and brahmacärés have first right to enjoy the sumptuous foodstuffs produced by the householders. If the householders enjoy such foodstuffs without first offering them in charity to the mendicants, such neglectful householders must undergo the lunar fast called cändräyaëam." In family life one must overcome the natural tendency toward selfishness by giving abundant charity. Modern society foolishly does not observe such Vedic injunctions, and as a result the world has become overrun by envious gåha-medhés, or persons wholly and solely dedicated to personal gratification in family life. Therefore, the whole world is seized in an uncontrollable spasm of violence and suffering. If one wants to live peacefully one must follow the Vedic injunctions regulating family life. Although the householders work very hard to accumulate money, the saintly sannyäsés and brahmacärés have the right to first enjoy the fruits of such labor. The conclusion is that one should give first priority to spiritual advancement in Kåñëa consciousness and thus perfect one's life. Then even without personal endeavor, one will be supplied all of one's necessities by the mercy of the Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Åñyaçåìga, the young son of the sage Mågé, was intentionally brought up by his father in an atmosphere of complete innocence. Mågé Åñi thought that if his son were never exposed to the sight of women he would always remain a perfect brahmacäré. But by chance the inhabitants of the neighboring kingdom, who were suffering from a long-term drought, received divine advice that rain would return to their kingdom only after the brähmaëa named Åñyaçåìga stepped foot in it. Therefore they sent beautiful women to the hermitage of Mågé to entice Åñyaçåìga and bring him back with them. Since Åñyaçåìga had never even heard about women, he easily fell for their trap. The name Åñyaçåìga indicates that the young sage was born with a deerlike horn growing out of his forehead. If like the deer a åñi becomes attracted to sweet musical sounds promising sense gratification, then like the deer he is quickly vanquished. A thoughtful person should humbly take instruction from the deer, who is doomed by attraction to musical sense gratification.</div>

<div class="First"> The fisherman places meaty bait on a sharp hook and easily attracts the unintelligent fish, who is greedy to enjoy its tongue. Similarly, people are mad after gratifying their tongues and lose all discrimination in their eating habits. For momentary gratification they construct huge slaughterhouses and kill millions of innocent creatures, and by inflicting such atrocious suffering they prepare a ghastly future for themselves. But even if one eats only the foods authorized in the Vedas, there is still danger. One may eat too sumptuously and then the artificially stuffed belly will create pressure on the sexual organs. Thus one will fall down into the lower modes of nature and commit sinful activities that lead to the death of one's spiritual life. From the fish one should carefully learn the real dangers involved in gratifying the tongue.</div>

<div class="Translation"> By fasting, learned men quickly bring all of the senses except the tongue under control, because by abstaining from eating such men are afflicted with an increased desire to gratify the sense of taste.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In South America there is a saying that when the belly is full the heart is content. Thus, one who is eating sumptuously is jolly, and if one is deprived of proper food one's appetite becomes even more voracious. An intelligent person, however, does not fall under the control of the tongue, but rather tries to make progress in Kåñëa consciousness. By accepting the remnants of food offered to the Lord (prasädam), one gradually purifies the heart and automatically becomes simple and austere.</div>
<div class="First"> In this connection, Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura states that the business of the tongue is to gratify itself with the varieties of flavor, but by wandering in the twelve holy forests of Vraja-mandala (Våndävana), one can be freed from the twelve flavors of material sense gratification. The five principal divisions of material relationships are neutral admiration, servitude, friendship, parental affection and conjugal love; the seven subordinate features of material relationships are material humor, astonishment, chivalry, compassion, anger, dread and ghastliness. Originally, these twelve rasas, or flavors of relationships, are exchanged between the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entity in the spiritual world; and by wandering in the twelve forests of Våndävana one can respiritualize the twelve flavors of personal existence. Thus one will become a liberated soul, free from all material desires. If one artificially tries to give up sense gratification, especially that of the tongue, the attempt will be a failure, and in fact one's desire for sense gratification will increase as a result of artificial deprivation. Only by experiencing real, spiritual pleasure in relationship with Kåñëa can one give up material desires.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Although one may conquer all of the other senses, as long as the tongue is not conquered it cannot be said that one has controlled his senses. However, if one is able to control the tongue, then one is understood to be in full control of all the senses.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> By eating, one gives energy and activity to all of the senses, and thus if the tongue is uncontrolled all of the senses will be dragged down to the material platform of existence. Therefore, by all means one must control the tongue. If one fasts, then all of the other senses become weak and lose their potency. The tongue, however, becomes more greedy to taste delicious preparations, and when one finally indulges the tongue, all of the senses quickly go out of control. Therefore, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura advises that one accept mahä-prasädam, or the remnants of the Lord's food, in a moderate proportion. Since the tongue's function is also to vibrate, one should vibrate the glorious holy name of the Supreme Lord and taste the ecstasy of pure Kåñëa consciousness. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, rasa-varjaà raso 'py asya paraà dåñövä nivartate: [Bg. 9.59] only by the higher taste of Kåñëa consciousness can one give up the deadly lower taste that keeps one imprisoned in material bondage.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura states that as long as one's intelligence is materially covered, one cannot understand the pleasure of Kåñëa consciousness. Trying to enjoy without Kåñëa, the living entity leaves the abode of the Supreme Lord, called Vrajabhümi, and comes down into the material world, where he quickly loses control of his senses. One becomes particularly victimized by the tongue, belly and genitals, which exert intolerable pressure on the conditioned soul. These desires subside, however, when one reestablishes one's blissful relationship with the Lord, who is actually the reservoir of all pleasure. One who is attached to the taste of Kåñëa consciousness automatically follows all of the rules and regulations of religious life due to spontaneous attraction to viçuddha-sattva, or the mode of pure goodness. Without such spontaneous attraction, one is certainly bewildered by the pushing of the material senses.</div>
<div class="First"> Even the beginning stage of devotional service, called sädhana-bhakti (regulatory practice), is so powerful that it brings one to the platform of anartha-nivåtti, where one becomes free from unwanted sinful habits and gains relief from the pressure of the tongue, belly and genitals. Thus one is delivered from the bondage of material addiction and can no longer be cheated by the allurements of the material energy. As it is said, all that glitters is not gold. In this regard Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura recommends that we consider the following song written by his father, Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura:</div>

But You, dear Kåñëa, are very kind to us and have given us such nice prasädam, just to control the tongue. Now we take this prasädam to our full satisfaction and glorify Their Lordships Çré Çré Rädhä-Kåñëa, and in love call for the help of Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityänanda."</div>

<div class="Translation"> The prostitute felt disgusted with her material situation and thus became indifferent to it.

<div class="First"> The network of material desires is created when one falsely thinks that he can establish himself permanently in the material world. This binding network should be cut by the sword of detachment; otherwise one will be forced to wander in the illusory network of mäyä with no understanding of liberated life on the spiritual platform.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In material existence all of the senses are attracted by different objects, and thus the conditioned soul becomes a first-class fool. The cause of material life is one's indifference to the Absolute Truth. The conditioned soul considers himself to be the lord and enjoyer of the material world and considers the purpose of life to be sense gratification. The more one tries to enjoy the material world, the more one's illusion increases.</div>
<div class="First"> It appears from this verse that the prostitute Piìgalä was not only earning her livelihood through prostitution, but was actually enjoying her illicit contact with innumerable men. The words käntäd asataù indicate that she was freely selling herself without discrimination to the most ordinary and useless men, considering them to be "lovers." Thus she says, "I was a great fool." The word bäliçä means "one who has a childish mentality, without practical experience of right and wrong."</div>

She could understand how foolishly she had struggled for money, not knowing that the Supreme Lord is always inclined to award prosperity to His sincere devotee. The prostitute was proud of her ability to please men, but she now laments that she did not try to please the Supreme Lord by loving service. The Supreme Lord is completely aloof from the transactions of the material world. Lord Kåñëa is the actual enjoyer of everyone and everything, but one must learn how to please the Lord by pure spiritual service.</div>

<div class="First"> The art of prostitution is based on awakening the enjoying propensity in men.

Eventually the body must disintegrate, and therefore there is certainly no one as unfortunate as one who has dedicated himself heart and soul to this flimsy body, which is filled with unpleasant elements.</div>

The answer given here is that if one actually wants to solve all the problems of life and go back home, back to Godhead, then the only solution is to take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord. It is well known that the demigods themselves are subject to birth and death.

<div class="First"> In this verse, Piìgalä states that by the Lord's mercy a self-realized soul can see that the entire universe is existing within the jaws of the great serpent of time. Certainly this is not a promising situation, and one who sees it loses his desire for sense gratification. Thus, by the Lord's causeless mercy, the spiritually sane living entity can protect himself from illusion. Since Piìgalä is now glorifying the Personality of Godhead for His mercy in awarding salvation, the following question might arise: Is she worshiping the Lord out of love, or is she merely a salvationist desiring liberation from material existence? In answer it may be said that in her Kåñëa conscious situation she is already liberated, even though remaining in this world. Her program will now be simply to render loving service to the Personality of Godhead without any personal desire, including that of salvation.</div>

Therefore, completely cutting off her desire to enjoy so-called lovers, Piìgalä very happily went to sleep. Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Eighth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Story of Piìgalä."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 9. Detachment from All that Is Material</div>
<div class="First"> The avadhüta brähmaëa describes his seven remaining gurus, beginning with the kurara bird. He also describes an additional guru, one's own body. The instruction received from the kurara bird is that attachment creates misery, but the person who is unattached and has no material possessions is qualified to achieve unlimited happiness.</div>
<div class="First"> The avadhüta brähmaëa learned from the foolish, lazy child that by becoming free from anxiety a person becomes capable of worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead and experiencing supreme ecstasy. The instruction received from the young girl who kept just one conchshell bracelet on each wrist is that one should remain alone and thus steady one's mind. Then only will it be possible for one to fix one's mind completely on the Personality of Godhead. Once several men arrived to ask for the hand of the young girl, whose relatives had coincidentally left the house. She went inside and began to prepare food for the unexpected guests by beating rice. At that time her conchshell bracelets were making a loud noise, rattling against each other, and in order to stop this sound she broke off the bracelets one by one until at last only one remained on each arm. Just as two or more bracelets make noise, if even two people reside in the same place, what to speak of many, there is every chance of mutual quarrel and useless gossip. The avadhüta brähmaëa also received instruction from the arrow maker, who was so absorbed in constructing an arrow that he did not even notice that the king was passing right by him on the road. In the same way, one must strictly control one's mind, concentrating it in the worship of Lord Çré Hari. The avadhüta brähmaëa learned from the serpent that a sage should wander alone, should not live in any prearranged place, should be always careful and grave, should not reveal his movements, should take assistance from no one and should speak little.</div>
<div class="First"> The instruction obtained from the spider, who spins his web from his mouth and then withdraws it, is that the Supreme Personality of Godhead similarly creates from out of Himself the whole universe and then winds it up into Himself.</div>
<div class="First"> From the weak insect who assumed the same form as the peçaskåt wasp, the avadhüta brähmaëa learned that the living entity, under the sway of affection, hatred and fear, attains in his next life the identity of that object upon which he fixes his intelligence.</div>
<div class="First"> Seeing that the fragile material body is subject to birth and death, one who is sober should become devoid of material attachment to this body and should properly utilize the rare gift of human life in the pursuit of knowledge, endeavoring always for the achievement of the highest goal.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Those who fervently seek material sense gratification are gradually pushed down into a miserable condition of life because as soon as one even slightly violates the laws of nature, one must suffer sinful reactions. Thus even materially alert and ambitious persons are constantly in anxiety, and from time to time they are plunged into great misery. Those who are nonsensical and retarded, however, live in a fool's paradise, and those who have surrendered to Lord Kåñëa are filled with transcendental bliss. Therefore both the fool and the devotee may be said to be peaceful, in the sense that they are free from the ordinary anxiety of the materially ambitious person. However, this does not mean that the devotee and the retarded fool are on the same platform. A fool's peace is like that of a dead stone, whereas a devotee's satisfaction is based on perfect knowledge.</div>

<div class="Translation"> When many people live together in one place there will undoubtedly be quarreling. And even if only two people live together there will be frivolous conversation and disagreement. Therefore, to avoid conflict, one should live alone, as we learn from the example of the bracelet of the young girl.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has given a nice example in this regard. Because the young girl mentioned in this story had no husband, she had to fulfill her duties as a host by removing her bracelets so that each wrist held one bracelet only. In the same way, the process of jïäna-yoga, or spiritual advancement by philosophical speculation, demands that the speculating sages live alone, without any other association. Since jïänés have dedicated their lives to speculation. there will undoubtedly be endless argument and quarreling on technical points if many jïänés live together. Therefore, to keep a peaceful atmosphere they must live alone. On the other hand, a king's daughter who has been duly married to an aristocratic prince fulfills her duties to her husband by dressing herself attractively with innumerable ornaments and approaching him for love. Similarly, the goddess of devotion, Bhakti-devé, decorates herself with the innumerable ornaments of the Vaiñëavas, who come together to relish the sweet sound of the holy name of the Lord. Because pure Vaiñëavas do not intimately associate with nondevotees, it may be said that they reside alone, and thus they also fulfill the purpose of this verse. There cannot be any quarrel among pure Vaiñëavas, because they are on the real platform of desirelessness, not wanting even salvation or mystic powers, what to speak of sense gratification. Because they are all devotees of Kåñëa, they may freely associate with one another for glorifying the Lord. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (3.25.34):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">naikätmatäà me spåhayanti kecin</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mat-päda-seväbhiratä mad-éhäù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ye 'nyonyato bhägavatäù prasajya</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sabhäjayante mama pauruñäëi</div>
<div class="First"> "A pure devotee, who is attached to the activities of devotional service and who always engages in the service of My lotus feet, never desires to become one with Me. Such a devotee, who is unflinchingly engaged, always glorifies My pastimes and activities."</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has commented on this verse as follows: "The young girl in the story kept only one bracelet on each wrist so that there would be no noisy conflict among the bracelets. Similarly, one should give up the association of those who are not devoted to the Supreme Lord." This is the actual lesson to be learned. A real Vaiñëava is always pure and faultless in character. However, in those places where nondevotees congregate there will undoubtedly be envious criticism of the devotional service of the Lord, and those who falsely attempt to analyze reality without the Supreme Personality of Godhead will create much disturbing noise in the name of philosophy. Therefore, one should remain in those places where the Supreme Lord is properly worshiped according to the Vedic standard. If everyone is dedicated to glorifying the Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, there will not be any impediment in mutual association. However, in a place where people have many different purposes besides the pleasure of the Supreme Lord, social dealings will certainly be disrupted.</div>
<div class="First"> One should therefore avoid the association of those who are inimical to devotional service; otherwise one will be frustrated in achieving the spiritual purpose of life. One who always keeps himself in the company of the devotees of the Lord is actually living alone. If one lives in a community where the only consideration is the pleasure of the Lord, then one can avoid the contradictory situations caused by many persons competing to satisfy their own material desires. This is the lesson intelligently understood by the brähmaëa from the bracelets of the young girl.</div>
<div class="First"> In this connection Çréla Madhväcärya quotes the following:</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Having perfected the yoga sitting postures and conquered the breathing process, one should make the mind steady by detachment and the regulated practice of yoga. Thus one should carefully fix the mind on the single goal of yoga practice.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> One should develop vairägya, or detachment, by observing that all material things are doomed. Thus one should take to the regulated practice of yoga, which in this age means the process of chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the avadhüta brähmaëa is recommending bhakti-miçra añöäìga-yoga, or the eightfold mystic yoga process performed as an offering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The desire to enjoy the material world is so strong that the mind wanders here and there uncontrollably. Therefore it is stated, dhriyamäëam: the mind must be fixed in the goal of life, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the perfect stage of mental concentration called samädhi there is no longer any distinction between internal and external vision, since one can see the Absolute Truth everywhere.</div>
<div class="First"> In the mystic yoga process one must sit properly, and then it is possible to control the different airs within the body. When the breathing process is controlled, the mind, which is dependent upon the actions of the bodily airs, is easily fixed in higher consciousness. But although the mind may be momentarily controlled, if one is overcome by desire for sense gratification the mind will again be lost. Thus, this verse emphasizes vairägya, detachment from material illusion. This is attained by abhyäsa-yoga, the regulated practice of Kåñëa consciousness, which is the highest yoga system, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä (6.47):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yoginäm api sarveñäà</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> The mind can be controlled when it is fixed on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Having achieved a stable situation, the mind becomes free from polluted desires to execute material activities; thus as the mode of goodness increases in strength, one can completely give up the modes of passion and ignorance, and gradually one transcends even the material mode of goodness. When the mind is freed from the fuel of the modes of nature, the fire of material existence is extinguished. Then one achieves the transcendental platform of direct relationship with the object of his meditation, the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The interaction of the three modes of nature creates great obstacles in one's path of spiritual advancement, and there is danger that one may be thrown down into the darkness of ignorance. Those who are experienced in practical psychology know the dangers of the uncontrolled mind and constantly endeavor to bring the mind under control. If one can free oneself from the influence of the material modes of passion and ignorance, then life becomes very auspicious. Controlling the mind, and thereby freeing oneself from the influence of the material modes of nature, is the only means of making actual progress in life. The word yasmin in this verse, according to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, indicates the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the reservoir of all pleasure. Giving up the material propensities of the mind does not mean merging into an impersonal existence, such as that experienced in dreamless sleep. As stated in this verse, sattvena våddhena: one must become firmly established in the mode of goodness and then gradually rise onto the spiritual platform, where one may dwell in the company of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Thus, when one's consciousness is completely fixed on the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one no longer sees duality, or internal and external reality. The example is given of the arrow maker who was so absorbed in making a straight arrow that he did not even see or notice the king himself, who was passing right next to him.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> It is understood that when a king moves on a public street he is heralded by kettledrums and other musical instruments and is accompanied by soldiers and other members of his retinue. Thus, despite this royal extravaganza passing right by his workshop, the arrow maker did not even notice because he was completely absorbed in his prescribed duty of making an arrow straight and sharp. One who is completely absorbed in loving devotional service to the Absolute Truth, Çré Kåñëa, no longer pays attention to material illusion. In this verse the word bahis, "external" refers to the innumerable objects of material sense gratification, such as food, drink, sex, and so on, which drag the senses of the conditioned soul into material duality. The word antaram, or "internal" refers to memory of previous sense gratification or hopes and dreams for future materialistic situations. One who is seeing everywhere the Absolute Truth, Çré Kåñëa, categorically rejects both internal and external illusion. This is called mukti-pada, or the status of liberation. On this platform there is neither attraction nor aversion to sense objects; rather, there is loving absorption in the Absolute Truth, Kåñëa, and an overwhelming desire to please Him by devotional service. One who gives up the reality of Kåñëa will be forced to wander uselessly in the kingdom of mental speculation. One who cannot see that the Absolute Truth, Lord Kåñëa, is the background and basis of everything that exists will be bewildered by the false concept that there is something that is not Kåñëa. Everything emanates from the Lord, and He is the Lord of everything. This simple understanding is the actual existential situation.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The previous narration concerning the shell bracelets of the young girl demonstrates that even saintly persons engaged in ordinary yoga processes should remain alone to avoid conflict or disturbance. In other words, persons engaged in ordinary yoga processes should not even associate with each other. This verse indirectly refers to the serpent, who, fearing attack from human beings, keeps himself secluded. From this example we learn that a saintly person should not associate with ordinary materialistic people. He should also avoid having a fixed residence and should wander unnoticed by others. Our engagement in material existence is the cause of our unhappiness. Such engagement destroys the real purpose of our life, Kåñëa consciousness. Somehow or other one must give up the deep-rooted attachment to material society, friendship and love. One must practice detachment, and by surrender to the principles of Kåñëa consciousness one's auspicious life will begin. By organizing one's life according to the varëäçrama system one can take the first step in self-realization. In other words, one should accept an honest occupation and regulate his sex life, either by giving it up entirely as a brahmacäré or sannyäsé or by living as a married householder. Without regulating one's occupation and personal life, there will be chaos, and it will be very difficult to make spiritual advancement. The attachments to material society, friendship and love are based on a long previous experience in the material world. They are great obstacles in the path of transcendental understanding, and if one maintains them, spiritual progress will be most difficult. Caitanya Mahäprabhu taught by His example and precept what a devotee should and should not do, and obedience to such principles brings one to the path of supreme perfection. Thus, one has to rise above ordinary social custom, which directs the living entity toward useless sense gratification.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The snake does not have the proclivity to build his own home, but rather lives in a suitable place constructed by other creatures. Thus he does not entangle himself in the labor of home building. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura points out that although materialistic persons take unlimited pains to invent and mass-produce electricity, automobiles, airplanes, etc., ultimately these things are meant for the convenience of the Vaiñëavas who are preaching Kåñëa consciousness. The karmés will always go to such trouble, and the devotees will always offer such laborious productions to the Supreme Personality of Godhead by engaging them in His loving service. The devotees, being concerned with the ultimate perfection of life, do not personally struggle for material advancement. On the other hand, there is no need for the devotees to artificially imitate the austere life-style of ancient times. A devotee's goal is simply to serve Kåñëa as nicely as possible; therefore the devotees willingly accept beautiful mansions and all types of material opulences, not with any personal attachment, but only so that these things can be engaged in the loving service of the Lord. If one engages such things with a desire to enjoy them, one falls down from the platform of pure devotional service. Materialistic persons are only interested in exploiting their so-called yoga practice in order to rejuvenate their sexual potency or to vainly remember their previous conditioned lives. Thus, applying mysticism to the endless search for sense gratification, they do not understand the actual goal of human life.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The Lord of the universe, Näräyaëa, is the worshipable God of all living entities. Without extraneous assistance, the Lord creates this universe by His own potency, and at the time of annihilation the Lord destroys the universe through His personal expansion of time and withdraws all of the cosmos, including all the conditioned living entities, within Himself. Thus, His unlimited Self is the shelter and reservoir of all potencies. The subtle pradhäna, the basis of all cosmic manifestation, is conserved within the Lord and is in this way not different from Him. In the aftermath of annihilation the Lord stands alone.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> As will be explained in verse 21 of this chapter, the Lord's independent creation and annihilation of the universe can be compared to the spider's creating and withdrawing his web. The word eka, or "one alone," is mentioned twice in this verse to emphasize that there is only one Supreme Personality of Godhead and that all universal affairs, as well as spiritual pastimes, are conducted by His potency alone. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, this verse refers to Käraëärëavaçäyé Viñëu, or Mahä-Viñëu lying in the Causal Ocean. The words ätmädhära and akhiläçraya both indicate that Näräyaëa is the reservoir or shelter of all existence. Ätmädhära indicates that the Lord's personal body is the shelter of everything. Mahä-Viñëu is a plenary portion of Lord Kåñëa, the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, from whose body expand the innumerable potencies that manifest the material and spiritual worlds. According to the Brahma-saàhitä these innumerable worlds rest within the brahmajyoti, or spiritual effulgence, also emanating from the Lord's body. Thus Kåñëa is éçvara, the supreme controller.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> When the Supreme Personality of Godhead displays His own potency in the form of time and guides His material potencies, such as the mode of goodness, into a neutral condition of equilibrium, He remains as the supreme controller of that neutral state, called pradhäna, as well as of the living entities. He is also the supreme worshipable object for all beings, including liberated souls, demigods and ordinary conditioned souls. The Lord is eternally free from any material designation, and He constitutes the totality of spiritual bliss, which one experiences by seeing the Lord's spiritual form. The Lord thus exhibits the fullest meaning of the word "liberation."</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> One who fixes his mind in the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, gets immediate relief from the waves of material anxiety because the Lord's transcendental form is completely free of any material contamination or designation. Less intelligent persons accept the illogical doctrine that the Lord is transformed into His creation and maintains no separate, individual existence. They falsely imagine that they can merge their individuality into the universal oneness and become exactly equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. However, in the opinion of Çrémad-Bhägavatam the Personality of Godhead is not impersonal but is instead full of all transcendental qualities. The three modes of material nature constitute His inferior energy, and the omnipotent time factor, upon which the modes rest, is the personal expansion of the Lord. Thus, the Lord creates, maintains and annihilates the material manifestation and yet remains completely apart from it. The conditioned souls who desire to exploit the Lord's inferior creation are impelled by the Personality of Godhead to do so, and thus they become imitation enjoyers in the temporary world of matter. But when one gains practical experience that the gross and subtle material bodies are simply coverings of the eternal soul, one gives up the foolishness of material attachment and becomes attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He realizes that his constitutional position is neither to enjoy matter nor merge into the Lord's existence. His real nature is that he is a servant of God. Service rendered to the Lord is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge, and by the potency of such service one becomes liberated and his activities become glorious. Such service is eternal and gradually promotes one to the platform of kevalänubhavänanda-sandoha, or merging into the ocean of bliss by seeing the transcendental personal form of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> O subduer of the enemies, at the time of creation the Personality of Godhead expands His own transcendental potency in the form of time, and agitating His material energy, mäyä, composed of the three modes of material nature, He creates the mahat-tattva.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word kevala means "pure" and indicates that the Lord's kälaçakti, or time potency, is a transcendental energy nondifferent from His personal body. The brähmaëa addresses King Yadu here as arindama, subduer of the enemies. This indicates that although the topic of mäyä, or illusory creation, is being discussed, the King need not worry, because as a staunch devotee of the Lord, he is able to subdue the real enemies of life, namely lust, anger and greed, which make one a prisoner in mäyä's kingdom. The word sütram indicates the mahat-tattva, on which many material creations rest, just like jewels rest on a thread. In the state of pradhäna, or material equilibrium, the modes of nature do not interact. In the Third Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Lord Kapila explains in His Säìkhya teachings that the Supreme Personality of Godhead agitates the neutral state of nature and thus creation takes place. The created manifest form of nature in which fruitive activities are stimulated is called mahat-tattva, as indicated in this verse.</div>
<div class="First"> If one tries to renounce the illusory creation of the Lord by taking shelter of impersonal Vedänta philosophy, thus artificially equating the infinite consciousness of the Lord and the infinitesimal consciousness of the conditioned soul, one's analysis will fall far short of reality. The word sva-mäyäm in this verse indicates that the illusory potency that covers the conditioned souls is always subordinate to the Lord, whose consciousness is infallible and infinite and who is always a person.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> According to great sages, that which is the basis of the three modes of material nature and which manifests the variegated universe is called the sütra or mahat-tattva. Indeed, this universe is resting within that mahat-tattva, and due to its potency the living entity undergoes material existence.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The cosmic manifestation is a reality because it emanates from the supreme reality, the Personality of Godhead. The material world, however, is temporary and full of problems. The conditioned soul foolishly tries to become the lord of this inferior creation and becomes separated from his real friend, the Supreme Lord. In this state, his only business is material sense gratification, and his real knowledge is lost.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> From this verse it is not hard to understand that if one constantly meditates upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one will achieve a spiritual body just like that of the Lord. The word dhiyä, "with intelligence," indicates complete intellectual conviction in a particular understanding, and similarly the word sakalam indicates one-pointed attention of the mind. With such complete absorption of consciousness, surely one will attain in the next life a form exactly like that upon which one was meditating. This is another example learned from the insect kingdom, as explained in the following verse.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> O King, once a wasp forced a weaker insect to enter his hive and kept him trapped there. In great fear the weak insect constantly meditated upon his captor, and without giving up his body, he gradually achieved the same state of existence as the wasp. Thus one achieves a state of existence according to one's constant concentration.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The following question may be raised: Since the weaker insect in this story did not physically change his body, how can it be said that he achieved the same state of existence as the wasp? Actually, by constant meditation upon a particular object one's consciousness becomes filled with its qualities. Due to extreme fear the smaller insect was absorbed in the characteristics and activities of the large wasp and thus entered into the existence of the wasp. Due to such meditation, he actually took the body of a wasp in his next life. Similarly, although we are conditioned souls, if we absorb our consciousness in Lord Kåñëa we can become liberated even before giving up our present body. If our intelligence becomes steady on the spiritual platform by understanding that Lord Kåñëa is everything, then we can give up unnecessary consciousness of the external body and absorb ourselves in the spiritual pastimes of Vaikuëöha. Thus even before death one can raise oneself to the spiritual platform and enjoy life as a liberated soul. Or, if one is a stubborn fool, then even in this life one can become just like an animal, such as a hog or a dog, constantly thinking of eating and sex life. But human life is actually meant for understanding the science of consciousness and the future results of our meditation.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The words yathä tathäpi are significant in this verse. Although the body bestows great benefit by enabling one to learn about this world, one should always remember its unhappy, inevitable future. If cremated, the body is burned to ashes by fire; if lost in a lonely place, it is consumed by jackals and vultures; and if buried in a luxurious coffin, it decomposes and is consumed by insignificant insects and worms. Thus it is described as pärakyam, "ultimately to be consumed by others." One should, however, carefully maintain bodily health to execute Kåñëa consciousness, but without undue affection or attachment. By studying the body's birth and death, one can acquire virakti-viveka, the intelligence to detach oneself from useless things. The word avasita indicates conviction. One should be convinced of all the truths of Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="Translation"> A man attached to the body accumulates money with great struggle to expand and protect the position of his wife, children, property, domestic animals, servants, homes, relatives, friends, and so on. He does all this for the gratification of his own body. As a tree before dying produces the seed of a future tree, the dying body manifests the seed of one's next material body in the form of one's accumulated karma. Thus assuring the continuation of material existence, the material body sinks down and dies.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> One might argue, "Among all the gurus mentioned thus far, the material body is certainly the best, since it awards the detachment and fine intelligence that enable one to engage in the devotional service of the Lord. Thus, we should serve the body, although it is temporary, with great attachment, or risk the offense of ungratefulness. How can detachment from the body be recommended when the body is endowed with so many wonderful qualities?" The answer is given in this verse. The body does not award detachment and knowledge in the manner of some benevolent teacher; rather, it causes so much pain and misery that any commonsense person cannot help being convinced of the uselessness of material life. Just as a tree produces the seeds of the next tree and then dies, the body's lusty desires induce the conditioned soul to create a further chain of karma. Finally the body, having paved the way for unlimited suffering in material existence, drops dead. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, deha indicates both the gross body and the subtle, mental body. Those who do not clearly understand the difference between body and soul falsely think that body and soul are identical and that one can find perfect happiness in bodily sense gratification. But those who foolishly accept the temporary body as all-important cannot be compared with self-realized souls who intelligently understand the superiority of the eternal soul.</div>

On one side the tongue is pulling him to arrange tasty food; then thirst drags him to get a suitable drink. Simultaneously the sex organs clamor for satisfaction, and the sense of touch demands soft, sensuous objects. The belly harasses him until it is filled, the ears demand to hear pleasing sounds, the sense of smell hankers for pleasant aromas, and the fickle eyes clamor for pleasing sights.

<div class="Translation"> The Supreme Personality of Godhead, expanding His own potency, mäyä-çakti, created innumerable species of life to house the conditioned souls. Yet by creating the forms of trees, reptiles, animals, birds, snakes and so on, the Lord was not satisfied within His heart. Then He created human life, which offers the conditioned soul sufficient intelligence to perceive the Absolute Truth, and became pleased.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> God has specifically created the human form of life to facilitate the liberation of the conditioned soul. Therefore one who abuses human life prepares his path to hell. As stated in the Vedas, puruñatve cävistaräm ätmä: "In the human form of life there is good possibility of understanding the eternal soul." The Vedas also state:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">täbhyo gäm änayat tä abruvan</div>

<div class="First"> The purport of this çruti-mantra is that lower forms of life, such as the cow and horse, are not actually suitable to fulfill the purpose of creation. But human life awards the opportunity to understand one's eternal relationship with God. Thus, one must control the material senses and fulfill the real purpose of human life. If one takes to Kåñëa consciousness, the Supreme Lord personally feels happiness and gradually reveals Himself to His devotee. The Lord's material creation consists of the living entities and dead matter, which the less intelligent try to enjoy. The Lord, however, is not satisfied by those species that blindly strive for sense gratification without understanding spiritual nature. We are suffering due to our forgetfulness of Kåñëa and the blissful situation of His abode. If we accept the Lord as protector and shelter and execute His order, we can easily revive our eternal, blissful nature as parts and parcels of the Personality of Godhead. It is for this purpose that the Lord has created human life.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> After many, many births and deaths one achieves the rare human form of life, which, although temporary, affords one the opportunity to attain the highest perfection. Thus a sober human being should quickly endeavor for the ultimate perfection of life as long as his body, which is always subject to death, has not fallen down and died. After all, sense gratification is available even in the most abominable species of life, whereas Kåñëa consciousness is possible only for a human being.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Material life essentially means repeated birth and death. Even the lowest forms of life, such as reptiles, insects, pigs and dogs, have ample opportunity for sense gratification. Even ordinary houseflies have a busy sex life and thus multiply rapidly. Human life, however, enables one to understand the Absolute Truth and is therefore full of grave responsibility. Since the valuable human life is not eternal, we should do the needful to achieve the highest perfection, Kåñëa consciousness. Before death appears, we should seriously cultivate our real self-interest.</div>
<div class="First"> One can experience Kåñëa consciousness in the association of devotees of the Lord. Without their association, one is in danger of being attracted to an impersonal conception of life, which causes one to fall away from devotional service to the Absolute Truth. Or, being discouraged by one's failure to understand the Absolute Truth, one may return to the false platform of sense gratification. In conclusion, human life is meant for cultivating Kåñëa consciousness under the guidance of the experienced, self-realized devotees of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Although the Absolute Truth is one without a second, the sages have described Him in many different ways. Therefore one may not be able to acquire very firm or complete knowledge from one spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Çrédhara Svämé comments on this verse as follows. "The statement that one requires many spiritual masters certainly needs explanation, since practically all great saintly persons of the past did not take shelter of many spiritual masters, but rather accepted one. The words géyate bahudharñibhiù, 'the Absolute Truth is glorified in many ways by the sages,' indicate the personal and impersonal understandings of the Absolute Truth. In other words, some sages describe only the Lord's impersonal effulgence, which is without spiritual variety, whereas others describe the Lord's manifest form as the Personality of Godhead. Thus, merely by hearing from many different authorities, one cannot actually learn the highest perfection of life. The proliferation of differing spiritual authorities is useful only to counteract the living entities' tendency to be grossly materialistic. Different spiritual philosophers create faith in the existence of the soul and may be accepted at that level. But as will be clarified in later verses, the spiritual master who ultimately gives perfect knowledge is one."</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Jéva Gosvämé comments as follows on this verse. "Since it is commonly understood that one is to accept a single spiritual master, why is it recommended that one learn from many so-called spiritual masters appearing in the forms of ordinary material objects? The explanation is that one's worshipable spiritual master will instruct one in many departments of knowledge by giving lessons gleaned from ordinary objects. As recommended by the brähmaëa avadhüta, one can strengthen the teachings received from one's äcärya and avoid transgressing his orders by observing ordinary things in nature. One should not mechanically receive the teachings of one's guru. The disciple should be thoughtful and with his own intelligence realize in practice what he has heard from his spiritual master by observing the world around him. In this sense one may accept many gurus, though not those who preach against the knowledge received from the bona fide spiritual master. In other words, one should not hear from persons like the atheist Kapila." Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura also comments on this verse, as follows. "It is stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam, tasmäd guruà prapadyeta jijïäsuù çreya uttamam: [SB 11.3.21] 'Therefore one should approach a bona fide spiritual master if one actually desires to achieve the highest perfection in life.' Similarly, in Chapter Ten, verse 5 of this canto, the Personality of Godhead Himself states, mad-abhijïaà guruà çäntam upäséta mad-ätmakam: 'One must serve a bona fide spiritual master who is in full knowledge of My personality and who is not different from Me.' There are many similar verses in Vedic literature indicating that one must take shelter of a single bona fide spiritual master. We also have the examples of innumerable great saintly persons who did not accept more than one spiritual master. Thus, it is a fact that we should accept one bona fide spiritual master and receive from him the particular mantra that one is to chant. I myself certainly follow this principle and worship my bona fide spiritual master. However, in worshiping one's äcärya, one may take help from good and bad examples. By observing examples of good behavior one will be strengthened in devotional service, and in seeing negative examples one will be forewarned and avoid danger. In this way, one may accept many ordinary material objects as one's spiritual masters, considering them as çikñä-gurus, or gurus who give important lessons for spiritual advancement."</div>
<div class="First"> Thus in the Lord's own words, mad-abhijïaà guruà çäntam upäséta mad-ätmakam: one should approach a single bona fide spiritual master who is in full knowledge of the Lord's personality and sincerely worship him, considering him to be mad-ätmakam, or nondifferent from the Lord Himself. This statement does not contradict what the Lord has presented in the teachings of the avadhüta brähmaëa. If one receives the teachings of one's äcärya but keeps them locked up in his brain as theoretical dogma, one will make little advancement. To develop steady, complete knowledge one must see the teachings of one's äcärya everywhere; thus a Vaiñëava offers all respects to anyone or anything that gives him further enlightenment in the path of worshiping his bona fide äcärya, who is nondifferent from Lord Kåñëa. Among the many gurus mentioned by the brähmaëa, some give positive instructions and others give negative instructions. Piìgalä the prostitute and the young girl who took off her bracelets provide examples of proper conduct, whereas the hapless pigeons and the foolish honeybee provide examples of behavior to be avoided. In both cases one's spiritual knowledge is enriched. Thus, one should not misunderstand the meaning of this verse in a way contradictory to the Lord's statement mad-abhijïaà guruà çäntam upäséta mad-ätmakam (SB 11.10.5).</div>

<div class="Chapnum"> 10. The Nature of Fruitive Activity</div>
<div class="First"> In this chapter Lord Çré Kåñëa refutes the philosophy of the followers of Jaimini and describes to Uddhava how the spirit soul bound within the material body can develop pure transcendental knowledge. The Vaiñëava, or one who has taken shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu, should observe the rules and regulations found in the Païcarätra and other revealed scriptures. According to his own natural qualities and work, he should follow the code of varëäçrama in a spirit free from motivation. The so-called knowledge received through one's material senses, mind and intelligence is as useless as the dreams experienced by a sleeping person attached to sense gratification. Therefore, one should give up work performed for sense gratification and accept work as a matter of duty. When one has come to understand something of the truth of the self, he should give up material work performed out of duty and simply engage himself in the service of the bona fide spiritual master, who is the manifest representative of the Personality of Godhead. The servant of the spiritual master should have very firm affection for his guru, should be anxious to receive from him knowledge of the Absolute Truth, and should be devoid of envy and the tendency to talk nonsense. The soul is distinct from the gross and subtle material bodies. The spirit soul who has entered into the material body accepts bodily functions according to the reactions of his own past activities. Therefore, only the bona fide, transcendental spiritual master is capable of demonstrating pure knowledge of the self.</div>
<div class="First"> The followers of Jaimini and other atheistic philosophers accept regulated material work as the purpose of life. But Kåñëa refutes this by explaining that the embodied soul who has come into contact with segmented material time takes upon himself a perpetual chain of births and deaths and is therefore forced to suffer the consequent happiness and distress. In this way there is no possibility that one who is attached to the fruits of his material work can achieve any substantial goal in life. The pleasures of heaven and other destinations, which are achieved by sacrificial rituals, can be experienced for only a short time. After one's enjoyment is finished, one must return to this mortal sphere to partake of lamentation and suffering. On the path of materialism there is certainly no uninterrupted or natural happiness.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In the previous chapters Lord Kåñëa described through the story of an avadhüta brähmaëa the qualities and character of a saintly person. Now the Lord describes the practical means for achieving such a saintly position. In the Païcarätra and other scriptures the Personality of Godhead gives instructions for executing devotional service. Similarly, in Bhagavad-gétä (4.13) the Lord says, cätur-varëyaà mayä såñöaà guëa-karma-vibhägaçaù: "I have personally created the varëäçrama system." There are innumerable rules and regulations in the varëäçrama system, and the devotee should execute those which do not contradict the process of devotional service. The term varëa indicates different classes of human beings, some in the mode of ignorance, some in the mode of passion and some in the mode of goodness. Devotional service to the Lord is executed on the liberated platform, and therefore some injunctions for those persons in passion and ignorance may be contradictory to the regulative principles for those on the liberated platform. Therefore, under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master who is nondifferent from the Lord, one should execute the basic principles of varëäçrama in a way favorable for advancement in Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="First"> In this verse the Lord describes the process of becoming desireless. All material sense objects, including those perceived by their form, taste, flavor, touch or sound, are temporary. We now see our family and nation, but ultimately they will disappear. Even our own body, by which we perceive them, will disappear. Thus, the inevitable result of material enjoyment is viparyaya, or great suffering. The word viçuddhätmä indicates those who have purified themselves by executing the regulative duties of devotional service.

<div class="Translation"> One who is sleeping may see many objects of sense gratification in a dream, but such pleasurable things are merely creations of the mind and are thus ultimately useless. Similarly, the living entity who is asleep to his spiritual identity also sees many sense objects, but these innumerable objects of temporary gratification are creations of the Lord's illusory potency and have no permanent existence. One who meditates upon them, impelled by the senses, uselessly engages his intelligence.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Because the fruits of material work are temporary, it ultimately does not matter whether or not one obtains them; the final result is the same. Materialistic activities can never award the highest perfection of life, Kåñëa consciousness. The material intelligence, impelled by the senses, strongly desires sense gratification. As stated here (bhedätma-dhéù), such intelligence actually separates one from one's real self-interest. Thus the intelligence, absorbed in that which is materially favorable and unfavorable, becomes divided in pursuit of innumerable categories of material advancement. Such divided intelligence is impotent and cannot understand the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa. The devotees of the Lord, however, have their intelligence fixed on one point—Lord Kåñëa. They meditate upon the Lord's form, qualities, pastimes and devotees, and thus their intelligence is never separated from the Absolute Truth. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (2.41):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">vyavasäyätmikä buddhir</div>

<div class="First"> If one is not Kåñëa conscious, he is uselessly dreaming without any understanding of his eternal situation. The material intelligence will always devise novel means of achieving happiness, and therefore one bounces from one fruitless program of sense gratification to another, ignoring the simple fact that all material things are temporary and will disappear. In this way one's intelligence becomes infected with material lust and greed, and such infected intelligence cannot bring one to the true goal of life. One should hear from the bona fide spiritual master whose intelligence is pure, and then one will come to Kåñëa consciousness, the highest perfection of life.</div>

<div class="Translation"> One who has fixed Me within his mind as the goal of life should give up activities based on sense gratification and should instead execute work governed by the regulative principles for advancement. When, however, one is fully engaged in searching out the ultimate truth of the soul, one should not accept the scriptural injunctions governing fruitive activities.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains that the words jijïäsäyäà sampravåttaù refer to one who is yoga-ärüòha, or advanced in the yoga process. In Bhagavad-gétä (6.3-4) it is stated:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ärurukñor muner yogaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">karma käraëam ucyate</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">sarva-saìkalpa-sannyäsé</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yogärüòhas tadocyate</div>
<div class="First"> "For one who is a neophyte in the eightfold yoga system, work is said to be the means; and for one who has already attained to yoga, cessation of all material activities is said to be the means. A person is said to have attained to yoga when, having renounced all material desires, he neither acts for sense gratification nor engages in fruitive activities." The example may be given that an ordinary man will try to enjoy the company of women for material sense pleasure. This is called pravåtta-karma, or the path of sense gratification. A religious person will also enjoy the company of a woman, but under the regulative principles of the varëäçrama system. However, one who is fully absorbed in spiritual advancement will ultimately give up all sense gratification derived from sexual association, either regulated or illicit. Similarly, in the stage of pravåtta-karma, or ordinary sense gratification, one will eat whatever pleases his tongue. On the other hand, a materialistic devotee will sometimes cook sumptuous preparations and offer them to the Deity, not in order to satisfy the Lord but rather with the intention of satisfying his own tongue and belly. However, one who is sampravåtta, or fully engaged in spiritual consciousness, is never interested in simply gratifying his tongue. He avoids ordinary foods prepared by materialistic persons, and just for the purpose of keeping his body fit for serving Kåñëa he eats moderate quantities of food that has first been offered to the Deity for the Deity's pleasure.</div>
<div class="First"> The process of spiritual realization gradually brings a conditioned soul from the lowest point of materialistic consciousness to total absorption in loving service to the Personality of Godhead. In the beginning one is taught to dovetail one's enjoying propensities by first offering to the Lord the fruit of one's work. In the advanced stage, however, the impulse to execute fruitive activities (karma-codanäm) is absent, and one simply engages in the loving service of the Lord without any selfish motive. For example, a renounced sannyäsé preaching Kåñëa consciousness, or even a renounced householder preaching Kåñëa consciousness, is not required to execute all of the injunctions governing sense gratification in family life. Ultimately, every human being should take to the transcendental duties of Kåñëa consciousness. Rather than working to fulfill one's own desires and then offering the results to Kåñëa, one should fully engage in pleasing the Lord directly according to His own intimate desires.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, any attempt to enjoy the material world, either religiously or irreligiously, ultimately will be full of contradictions. One should come to the the platform of desirelessness, pure love of Godhead, and thus solve all of the problems of life.</div>

<div class="Translation"> One who has accepted Me as the supreme goal of life should strictly observe the scriptural injunctions forbidding sinful activities and, as far as possible, should execute the injunctions prescribing minor regulative duties such as cleanliness. Ultimately, however, one should approach a bona fide spiritual master who is full in knowledge of Me as I am, who is peaceful, and who by spiritual elevation is not different from Me.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word yamän refers to major regulative injunctions necessary for preserving one's purity. In the Kåñëa consciousness movement all bona fide members must give up eating meat, fish and eggs, and they must also avoid intoxication, gambling and illicit sex. The word abhijïam indicates that one cannot at any time perform such forbidden activities, even in difficult circumstances. The word niyamän refers to less obligatory injunctions, such as bathing three times daily. In certain difficult situations one may not bathe three times daily yet may still maintain one's spiritual position. But if one engages in sinful, forbidden activities, even in difficult circumstances, there undoubtedly will be a spiritual falldown. Ultimately, as explained in Upadeçämåta, mere adherence to rules and regulations cannot give one spiritual perfection. One must approach a bona fide spiritual master who is mad-abhijïam, or in full knowledge of the personal form of Godhead. The word mat ("Me") negates the possibility of a bona fide spiritual master having an impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth. Furthermore, the guru must be in complete control of his senses; therefore he is called çänta, or peaceful. Because of being completely surrendered to the mission of the Lord, such a spiritual master is mad-ätmakam, or nondifferent from the Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The servant or disciple of the spiritual master should be free from false prestige, never considering himself to be the doer. He should be active and never lazy and should give up all sense of proprietorship over the objects of the senses, including his wife, children, home and society. He should be endowed with feelings of loving friendship toward the spiritual master and should never become deviated or bewildered. The servant or disciple should always desire advancement in spiritual understanding, should not envy anyone and should always avoid useless conversation.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> No one can claim to be the permanent proprietor of his so-called wife, family, home, society, and so on. Such material relationships appear and disappear like bubbles on the surface of the ocean. No one can claim to be the creator of the material elements that produced one's home, society and family. If it were a fact that parents were the ultimate creators of the bodies of their children, children would never die before their parents; the parents would simply create new bodies for the children. Similarly, parents would also not die, because they would create new bodies for themselves to replace the old ones. Actually, God creates everyone's bodies as well as the material elements with which we build our material societies. Therefore, before death drags these things out of our grasp, we should voluntarily engage them in the loving service of the spiritual master, who is the bona fide representative of Lord Kåñëa. Then such material objects, instead of causing lamentation, will be the cause of happiness.</div>

<div class="Translation"> One should see one's real self-interest in life in all circumstances and should therefore remain detached from wife, children, home, land, relatives, friends, wealth and so on.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> A devotee of the Lord recognizes that his wife, children, home, land, friends and money are meant to be engaged in the loving service of the Supreme Lord. Therefore, he does not frantically make arrangements for the sense gratification of his family and friends. He is not eager to enjoy the false prestige of being the master of his wife and the lord of his children, nor is he anxious to gain prestige from his friends and society. Thus he does not envy anyone and is not lazy in the matter of self-realization. He is free from the false sense of proprietorship and is always eager to develop his understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is free from false egotism and automatically turns away from useless materialistic conversation. Thus he is steady and not whimsical, and he is always firmly situated in loving friendship at the lotus feet of the spiritual master.</div>
<div class="First"> The question may be raised as to how one can develop freedom from false proprietorship. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has given the following example. An ordinary man is very eager to accumulate more and more money, and he maintains his wealth in the form of stocks, bonds, securities, bank accounts, properties, gold, and so on. As long as these different assets are contributing to his financial well-being, he sees them equally and considers that they belong to him. But if some of his assets are taken by the government for taxes, or if they are lost in an unfortunate business arrangement, then he is forced to give up his sense of proprietorship. In the same way, everyone should be intelligent enough to observe that one's sense of ownership over innumerable material objects is not permanent; therefore one should develop detachment from these things. If one does not cultivate a loving feeling of friendship for the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His pure devotee, the spiritual master, one will undoubtedly be entangled by the network of material society, friendship and love. One will then remain bound up on the material platform with no hope of permanent happiness.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Just as fire, which burns and illuminates, is different from firewood, which is to be burned to give illumination, similarly the seer within the body, the self-enlightened spirit soul, is different from the material body, which is to be illuminated by consciousness. Thus the spirit soul and the body possess different characteristics and are separate entities.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> It is analytically demonstrated in this verse that one should never falsely identify the ego with the material body. Such misidentification is called false ego, or material illusion. The following question may be raised. Since it is commonly known that the Supreme Personality of Godhead enlightens the conditioned soul, why is the term sva-dåk, or "self enlightened," used in this verse? Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains that although the Supreme Personality of Godhead certainly furnishes consciousness to the living entity, the living entity, being endowed with the potency of the Lord has himself the capacity to revive and expand his pure consciousness. He may therefore be considered, in a secondary sense, self-enlightened. The example may be given that gold or silver domes brilliantly reflect the rays of the sun. Although the light comes from the sun, the inherent properties of gold and silver can also be considered causes for the brilliant reflection, since other substances do not possess suitable properties to reflect the sun's light. Similarly, the spirit soul can be considered sva-dåk, or self-enlightened, because he possesses characteristics by which he can brilliantly reflect the potency of the Personality of Godhead, thus illuminating his existential situation, just as a gold or silver dome shines due to its reflective properties. A nice example is given in this verse to illustrate the different characteristics of the body and soul. Fire, which burns and illuminates, is always different from that which is burned for illumination. It may be said, however, that fire is present in an unmanifest form within wood. Similarly, in the conditioned life of ignorance, the spirit soul is present, though unmanifest, within the body. The enlightened condition of the living entity can be compared to the act of arousing fire within wood. Just as fire quickly burns wood to ashes, similarly the spirit soul, when enlightened, burns to ashes the darkness of ignorance. We are conscious of the body; therefore it may be said that the body is illuminated by consciousness, which is the energy, or symptom, of the spirit soul. Identifying the body and soul as one is just as foolish as considering fire and wood to be the same. In both cases, the intimate circumstantial connection between fire and wood or between the soul and the body does not alter the fact that fire is different from wood or that the soul is always different from the body.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Just as fire may appear differently as dormant, manifest, weak, brilliant and so on, according to the condition of the fuel, similarly, the spirit soul enters a material body and accepts particular bodily characteristics.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Although fire may appear and disappear within a particular object, the element fire always exists. Similarly, the eternal soul appears within a suitable body and then disappears from that body, but the soul always exists. Just as fire is different from its fuel, the soul is different from the body. A match makes a tiny fire, whereas the explosion of a huge gasoline tank will send flames shooting up into the sky. But still, fire is one. Similarly, one spirit soul may appear in the body of Brahmä and another in the body of an ant, but the spirit soul is qualitatively the same in every body. Because of ignorance we impose the bodily characteristics upon the soul, and thus we say that a particular person is American, Russian, Chinese, African or Mexican or that he is old or young. Although such designations certainly apply to the body, they do not apply to the spirit soul, which is described here as paraù, or a transcendental entity. As long as the bewildered spirit soul remains inimical to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the designations of the gross and subtle bodies will wrap themselves around him, keeping him in darkness. If one intellectually identifies oneself with various materialistic philosophies of life, he becomes covered by the subtle mind. Ultimately everything that exists is part and parcel of the Absolute Truth, Lord Kåñëa. When the living entity realizes this, he becomes nirupädhi, or free from material designations. This is his constitutional position.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> The subtle and gross material bodies are created by the material modes of nature, which expand from the potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Material existence occurs when the living entity falsely accepts the qualities of the gross and subtle bodies as being his own factual nature. This illusory state, however, can be destroyed by real knowledge.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Regarding the analogy comparing fire and its fuel to the soul and the body, one may argue that to some extent fire is dependent upon its fuel and cannot exist without it. Since we do not experience the existence of fire independent of fuel, one may therefore still question how it is possible for the living entity to exist separately from the body, become covered by it and eventually become free from it. Only through the Supreme Personality of Godhead's knowledge potency (vidyä) can one clearly understand the nature of the living entity. By vidyä, or real knowledge, one may cut material existence to pieces and even in this lifetime experience spiritual reality. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, our material existence is an artificial imposition. By the Lord's inconceivable potency of nescience, the qualities of gross and subtle material forms are psychologically imposed upon the living being, and because of misidentification with the body, the living entity initiates a series of illusory activities. As explained in the previous chapter, the present material body is like a tree that produces the karmic seed of the next body. However, this cycle of ignorance can be cut to pieces by the transcendental knowledge explained by the Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> Unfortunately, the conditioned souls, being inimical to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, do not accept the perfect knowledge spoken by the Lord. Instead they remain absorbed in gross and subtle illusion. But if the living entity accepts the Lord's knowledge, his whole situation can be rectified, and he can return to his original, eternal, blissful life of perfect knowledge in the direct association of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word yathä-kramam ("step by step") means that after first realizing oneself to be different from the gross material body one should then progressively detach oneself from material mental activities. In this verse etad vastu-buddhim means seeing the material world as existing independently rather than correctly seeing all things as emanations of the Absolute Truth. When one correctly identifies oneself as eternal spiritual form, one achieves the real fruit of knowledge. The Lord is eternally manifest in His eternal form, and the living entity is similarly manifest in his eternal form as the loving servitor of the Lord. When we falsely assume that temporary, illusory material objects are real, knowledge of our eternal spiritual form is covered by ignorance. If, however, one meditates upon the Lord's supreme presence within everything, one can return to the normal, blissful state of spiritual life. Every human being should seriously endeavor to understand the Absolute Truth, as indicated in this verse by the word jijïäsayä.</div>

From the spiritual master transcendental knowledge, like fire, is spread to the disciple. Just as friction between two sticks of firewood produces fire, similarly, bona fide contact between the spiritual master, who is the representative of Kåñëa, and a sincere disciple produces the fire of knowledge. When the disciple takes shelter of the lotus feet of the spiritual master, he automatically acquires perfect knowledge of his original, spiritual form.</div>

<div class="Translation"> By submissively hearing from an expert spiritual master, the expert disciple develops pure knowledge, which repels the onslaught of material illusion arising from the three modes of material nature. Finally this pure knowledge itself ceases, just as fire ceases when the stock of fuel has been consumed.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The Sanskrit word vaiçäradé means "that which is derived from the expert [viçärada]." Perfect transcendental knowledge comes from the expert spiritual master, and when such knowledge is heard by the expert disciple, it curbs the waves of material illusion. Since the Lord's illusory energy acts eternally within the material world, there is no possibility of destroying illusion. One may, however, destroy the presence of illusion within one's own heart. To accomplish this the disciple must become expert in pleasing the expert spiritual master. As one advances to the perfectional stage of Kåñëa consciousness, experiencing the presence of the Lord everywhere, one's attention shifts to the transcendental platform. At that time, pure knowledge itself, one's constant technical awareness of illusion, diminishes, just as fire diminishes and is extinguished after consuming its stock of fuel. Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted from several Vedic scriptures to show that mäyä, or material illusion, is just like a witch who always haunts the conditioned souls. Mäyä offers the conditioned souls whatever they like within the three modes of nature, but such offerings are all just like fire that burns the heart to ashes. Therefore, one must understand that the material world is a hellish place, offering a permanent situation to no one. Externally we experience many things, and internally we contemplate our experience, formulating plans for future action. Thus internally and externally we are victims of ignorance. Real knowledge comes from the Vedas, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form of perfect wisdom. If we become fully Kåñëa conscious, taking complete shelter of the Lord, there will be no scarcity of pleasure, because the Lord is the reservoir of all pleasure, and His devotees freely move within that reservoir.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear Uddhava, I have thus explained to you perfect knowledge. There are philosophers, however, who challenge My conclusion. They state that the natural position of the living entity is to engage in fruitive activities, and they see him as the enjoyer of the happiness and unhappiness that accrue from his own work. According to this materialistic philosophy, the world, time, the revealed scriptures and the self are all variegated and eternal, existing as a perpetual flow of transformations. Knowledge, moreover, cannot be one or eternal, because it arises from the different and changing forms of objects; thus knowledge itself is always subject to change. Even if you accept such a philosophy, My dear Uddhava, there will still be perpetual birth, death, old age and disease, since all living entities must accept a material body subject to the influence of time.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In this verse, according to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, Lord Kåñëa speaks the following to Uddhava. "My dear Uddhava, I have clearly established the actual goal of life in the instructions I have just imparted to you. There are those, however, who challenge My conclusion, especially the followers of Jaimini Kavi. If you are favorable to their understanding and thus do not accept My instructions, then kindly hear the following explanation. "According to the followers of Jaimini, the living entity is originally and naturally a performer of fruitive activities, and his happiness and distress are derived from the fruits of his own work. The world in which the living entities find their enjoyment, the time during which they enjoy, the revealed scriptures that explain the means for achieving enjoyment, and the subtle bodies through which the living entities experience enjoyment all exist not only in manifold variety but also eternally.</div>
<div class="First"> "The living entity need not develop detachment from material sense gratification, either by seeing the temporariness of individual material objects and situations or by seeing the material world as an illusory creation (mäyä). According to such materialistic philosophy, material objects such as garlands, sandalwood or beautiful women are temporary in specific manifestations but perpetually exist through the natural flow of creation and destruction. In other words, although a particular woman's form is temporary, there will eternally be beautiful women within the material world. Thus, by carefully executing fruitive rituals according to religious scriptures, one can maintain enjoyable contact with women and wealth life after life. In this way one's sense gratification will be eternal.</div>
<div class="First"> "The Jaimini philosophers further say that there never was a time when the world did not exist as it does today, which implies that there is no supreme controller who has created it. They claim that the arrangement of this world is real and appropriate and thus is not illusory. Moreover, they say that there is no eternal knowledge of an original perpetual form of the soul. In fact, they say, knowledge arises not from some absolute truth but from the differences among material objects. Knowledge therefore is not eternal and is subject to change. The assumption hidden in this statement is that there is no spirit soul who possesses eternal, constant knowledge of a single, unchanging reality. Rather, the nature of consciousness or knowledge is that it undergoes constant transformation. They state, however, that eternality is not refuted by the perpetually transforming nature of consciousness. Consciousness perpetually exists, they say, but not in the same form.</div>
<div class="First"> "Thus, the followers of Jaimini conclude that the transformation of knowledge does not negate its eternality; rather, they state that knowledge eternally exists within the perpetual nature of its transformation. They therefore naturally come to the path of regulated sense gratification rather than the path of renunciation, for in the state of mukti, or liberation, the living entity would not have any material senses, and thus the transformation of material understanding would not be possible. Such philosophers consider that the achievement of an unchanging state of mukti would stunt or paralyze the natural activity of the living entity and thus would not be in his self-interest. The path of nivåtti (aiming toward renunciation and transcendence of the material world) is naturally not interesting to such materialistic philosophers. Accepting for argument's sake the validity of such materialistic philosophy, one can easily demonstrate that the path of regulated sense gratification brings many unwanted and miserable results to the living entity. Therefore even from a materialistic viewpoint, detachment is desirable. Material time is divided into different sections such as days, weeks, months and years, and by material time the living entity is repeatedly forced to undergo the miseries of birth, death, old age and disease. That such real miseries occur everywhere throughout the universe is well known." In this way, states Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, Lord Kåñëa has pointed out the defect of materialistic philosophy to Uddhava.</div>
<div class="First"> We may further elaborate that if one falsely accepts the atheistic philosophy of Jaimini and his innumerable modern followers. then the living entity perpetually remains entangled in the anguish of birth, death, old age and disease. This bogus, atheistic philosophy encourages material gratification as the only logical goal of life, but the living entity will inevitably commit mistakes in the execution of regulated sense gratification and eventually go to hell. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa, personally tells Uddhava that this materialistic philosophy is false and irrelevant to the actual self-interest of the living entity.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Although the performer of fruitive activities desires perpetual happiness, it is clearly observed that materialistic workers are often unhappy and only occasionally satisfied, thus proving that they are not independent or in control of their destiny. When a person is always under the superior control of another, how can he expect any valuable results from his own fruitive actions?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Although materialistic persons reject Kåñëa consciousness and instead pursue temporary sense gratification, even that sense gratification is often beyond their reach. If a person could really control his destiny, why would he create problems for himself? No intelligent person would impose death, old age or disease upon himself or his loved ones. One should recognize that these unwanted miseries are forced upon one by a higher power. Since we are all obviously under superior control, the atheistic philosophy advising one to simply perform fruitive activities and create a happy life is most imperfect. Due to the influence of time, happiness and misery are created. When a woman becomes pregnant, her husband, relatives and friends eagerly await the birth of the child. As time passes and the child is born, everyone feels great happiness. But as the child grows into old age and eventually dies, that same passage of time is a cause of suffering. Ignorant persons vainly seek help from scientists who work feverishly and fruitlessly in their laboratories to stop death. In modern times, inventions have been created to eliminate the inconveniences of life, but the maintenance and production of such conveniences has proven to be unbearably inconvenient for hundreds of millions of people throughout the world. Only the most foolish person will propose that there is no superior controller and that one can achieve favorable results by expert performance of material activities. Ultimately all material activities are useless because they end in annihilation. If one is driving a car but has only limited control, the situation is most dangerous and must lead inevitably to disaster. Similarly, although we are trying to direct the material body to happiness, we are not in full control of the bodily demands, and therefore there will inevitably be disaster.

<div class="Translation"> It is observed within the material world that sometimes even an intelligent person is not happy. Similarly, sometimes even a great fool is happy. The concept of becoming happy through expertly performing material activities is simply a useless exhibition of false egotism.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> It may be argued that an intelligent person can expertly perform pious activities within the material world and thus never experience suffering, since unhappiness is caused by sinful or impious activities. However, we often observe great suffering even among pious, intelligent persons, because they sometimes fail in the execution of their duty and sometimes consciously or unconsciously perform a forbidden activity. With this argument the Lord refutes the theory that simply on the strength of material piety one may remain perpetually happy without Kåñëa consciousness. On the other hand, we observe that even the most foolish or sinful persons sometimes experience happiness, because even those completely dedicated to sin sometimes accidentally perform pious activities by inadvertently traveling through a holy place or helping a saintly person. The material creation of God is so complex and bewildering that even those dedicated to piety sometimes commit sins, and even those dedicated to sinful life sometimes perform pious actions. Therefore, within the material world we do not find absolute happiness or unhappiness. Rather, every conditioned soul is hovering in confusion, without perfect knowledge. Piety and sin are relative material ideas that bestow relative happiness and unhappiness. Absolute happiness is experienced on the spiritual platform in full Kåñëa consciousness, or love of God. Thus material life is always ambiguous and relative, whereas Kåñëa consciousness is the actual platform of perfect happiness.</div>

<div class="First"> If the so-called intelligent materialists know the means of achieving happiness and destroying unhappiness, then they should deliver people from inevitable death. The scientists are busily working to solve this problem, but since they have completely failed, it is understood that they are not actually intelligent and that they do not know the means of achieving happiness and eliminating misery. It is most foolish to think that one can be happy with an ax hanging over one's neck. Lord Kåñëa says in Bhagavad-gétä, måtyuù sarva-haraç cäham: [Bg. 10.34] "I Myself come before you as death and take everything away." We should not blindly ignore the disaster of material life, but should instead accept the Lord's causeless mercy, which He so magnanimously offers in His incarnation as Caitanya Mahäprabhu,. We should surrender to the lotus feet of Lord Caitanya, who offers the real means for achieving unqualified happiness: the chanting of the holy names of the Lord. This is the Lord's desire, and it is in our own self-interest to take up this process.</div>

If one is sitting in one's living room with a deadly snake at one's side, knowing that at any moment the poisonous fangs might pierce the flesh, how can one sit peacefully and watch television or read a book? Similarly, unless one is more or less crazy, one cannot be enthusiastic or even peaceful in material life.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura comments as follows on this verse. "Ordinarily, if there is no specific impediment, agricultural endeavors will yield their fruits. If, however, there is a defect in the seed, or if the soil is too salty or barren, or if there is drought, plague, excessive rain or heat out of season, or if there are disturbances caused by animals, birds or insects, then agricultural activities will not yield the desired harvest. Similarly, those who are expert in analyzing the material world see that the heavenly situations offered in the Vedas are not basically different from life on the earth. By the interaction of conditioned souls there will inevitably be jealousy as one becomes distinguished as superior and another as inferior. By the power of time these positions are reversed, and therefore violence and intrigue disturb life even on the heavenly planets. In fact, the attempt to promote oneself to the heavenly planets is itself full of problems and disturbances. One should therefore understand that the kingdom of God, Vaikuëöha, is transcendental to the limitations and disturbances imposed by the laws of material nature in this world. If one wrongly concludes that such imperfections are also present in the kingdom of God, then one will be polluted by material contamination."</div>

<div class="Translation"> If a human being is engaged in sinful, irreligious activities, either because of bad association or because of his failure to control his senses, then such a person will certainly develop a personality full of material desires. He thus becomes miserly toward others, greedy and always anxious to exploit the bodies of women. When the mind is so polluted one becomes violent and aggressive and without the authority of Vedic injunctions slaughters innocent animals for sense gratification. Worshiping ghosts and spirits, the bewildered person falls fully into the grip of unauthorized activities and thus goes to hell, where he receives a material body infected by the darkest modes of nature. In such a degraded body, he unfortunately continues to perform inauspicious activities that greatly increase his future unhappiness, and therefore he again accepts a similar material body. What possible happiness can there be for one who engages in activities inevitably terminating in death?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In the Vedic analysis of civilized life there are two paths. One who takes to the path of nivåtti-märga immediately renounces material sense gratification and purifies his existence by performance of austerity and devotional activities. On the path of pravåtti-märga one furnishes a steady supply of sense objects to the senses, but one consumes such sense objects under strict regulations and through ritualistic ceremonies, thus gradually purifying the heart and satiating the material senses. Unfortunately, as explained in this and the previous verse, the path of pravåtti-märga is extremely volatile because rather than becoming detached, the living entity often becomes uncontrolled and fully addicted to further sense gratification. In the previous verse the path of regulated, authorized sense gratification was described, and in this verse the path of unauthorized, demoniac sense gratification is described. In this verse, the words saìgäd asatäà väjitendriyaù are very significant. One may fall down into sinful life by bad association, or even in good association one may fail to control his senses. Ultimately each living entity is responsible for his existential situation. The word adharma-rataù in this verse indicates those engaged in excessive sex life, meat-eating, drinking and other inauspicious activities that transgress the codes of civilized human life. Being in the mode of ignorance, these persons develop such a cruel mentality that they do not consider any festive occasion complete without the consumption of large quantities of meat obtained by slaughtering helpless animals. Eventually such persons become influenced by ghosts and spirits, who deprive them of all ability to discriminate between right and wrong. Losing all sense of decency, they become fit candidates for entrance into the darkest modes of material existence. Sometimes these lusty, intoxicated carnivores, considering themselves pious, pray to God in a useless way. Afflicted by innumerable material desires, they rotate from one material body to another without experiencing true happiness. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has noted that material life is so disturbing that even if one is allowed to live for an entire day of Brahmä—approximately 8,640,000,000 years—one will eventually be afflicted by the fear of death. In fact, Brahmä himself is disturbed by fear of death, what to speak of tiny human beings who live a paltry seventy or eighty years at most. Thus, as stated here, kià sukhaà martya-dharmiëaù: what possible happiness can one find within the painful grip of material illusion?</div>

<div class="Translation"> The material senses create material activities, either pious or sinful, and the modes of nature set the material senses into motion. The living entity, being fully engaged by the material senses and modes of nature, experiences the various results of fruitive work.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> It has been explained in the previous verses that the living entity under the control of fruitive activities is pushed down into a hellish condition of life. In this verse the exact nature of the living entity's dependence on fruitive activities is described. One can observe that one's activities are performed by the material senses and that the living entity himself is merely conscious of such activities. One may be worshiping the demigods, enjoying sex or performing agricultural or intellectual activities, but in all cases the material senses are performing the work.</div>
<div class="First"> One may argue that the spirit soul initiates the activities of the senses and thus is the ultimate doer, but such false egotism is negated in this verse by the statement guëäù såjanti karmäëi guëo 'nusåjate guëän. The three modes of nature—goodness, passion and ignorance—stimulate the functions of the material senses, and the living entity, coming under the control of a particular mode of nature, merely experiences the good and bad results of his work. This does not negate the concept of free will, since the living entity chooses to associate with different modes of nature. By one's eating, speaking, sexual activities, occupation, etc., one associates with various modes of nature and acquires a particular mentality. But in all cases the modes of nature themselves are acting, not the living entity. The word asau in this verse indicates that the living entity falsely considers himself to be the performer of work carried out by nature. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (3.27):</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">kartäham iti manyate</div>
<div class="First"> "The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself to be the doer of activities, which are in actuality carried out by nature." The conditioned soul can be liberated simply by giving up this false egoistic conception of life and taking to the devotional service of the Lord, by which the living entity, or marginal potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, escapes the disturbing influence of the external potency called mäyä. In the devotional service of the Lord the liberated entity realizes his actual form of eternity, knowledge and bliss. It is natural to perform activities with a desire to achieve a good result. The best results, however, can be attained by one who engages in the devotional service of the Lord with a desire to be reinstated in his constitutional position as the Lord's loving servant. In this way the tendency to exploit one's own activities for a particular result can be purified; then the modes of nature and the material senses will no longer engage the living entity in illusion. The living entity is by nature blissful, and when his illusion ceases, all suffering comes to an end. The liberated soul is then fit to reside in Vaikuëöha, the kingdom of God.</div>

<div class="Translation"> As long as the living entity thinks that the modes of material nature have separate existences, he will be obliged to take birth in many different forms and will experience varieties of material existence. Therefore, the living entity remains completely dependent on fruitive activities under the modes of nature.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word guëa-vaiñamyam indicates forgetfulness of Lord Kåñëa, which causes one to see material varieties as separate states of existence. The living entity, being attracted to material varieties and having faith in them, is forced to experience these varieties in different material bodies, such as those of demigods, pigs, businessmen, insects, and so on. According to the karma-mémäàsä philosophers, there is no transcendental living entity who is the background of all existence. They accept material variety as the final reality. However, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa, is the actual basis of everything. Everything is within Him, and He is within everything. A pure devotee of the Lord sees Kåñëa everywhere and sees all of the variegated modes of nature as the potency of Lord Kåñëa. One who does not see Lord Kåñëa will certainly see material variegatedness as the supreme reality. Such vision is called mäyä, or gross illusion, and is similar to the vision of an animal. Päratantryam means one will remain caught in the web of fruitive activities unless one gives up this superficial, separatist vision.</div>

<div class="First"> The living entity is bound in the network of illusion, but although he can understand that he is dependent upon superior powers, he does not want to serve the Supreme Lord. He thus becomes filled with fear of life itself. Desiring material sense gratification, the living entity, like the demon Kaàsa, always fears destruction of his material arrangement. Remaining addicted to the flavors of material nature, one gradually sinks down into an irrational form of life.</div>
<div class="First"> Mäyä has two potencies—the first covers the living entity, and the second throws him down into a hellish condition of life. When one is covered by mäyä, one loses all power of discrimination, and mäyä then throws such a fool into the darkness of ignorance. When one wrongly considers oneself to be independent of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa, one becomes a worshiper of temporary material objects, hoping to enjoy material sense gratification, and as one grows older, one's life becomes filled with fear and anxiety. A conditioned soul considers himself to be in control of his life, but since he does not have any actual controlling potency, his situation is contradictory and not at all pleasing. As all of one's material possessions are taken away by time, one becomes filled with lamentation. All in all, material life is truly abominable, and it is only because of dense illusion that we accept it as satisfactory.</div>

<div class="First"> One can experience the potency of the Personality of Godhead by observing how different species of life—demigods, human beings, animals, fish, birds, insects, plants, etc.—gradually evolve their natures and activities. Each species of life executes a particular process of sense gratification, and this function is called the dharma of the species. Lacking knowledge of the Personality of Godhead, ordinary persons catch a glimpse of the Lord's potencies in the above-mentioned manifestations. Çréla Madhväcärya has cited the following information from the Tantra-bhägavata. The Lord is called käla, or time, because He is the mover and controller of all material qualities. Because He is complete and perfect, He is called ätmä, or the Self; and He is the personification of all knowledge. The word svabhäva indicates that the Lord fully controls His own destiny; and as the maintainer of everyone He is called dharma. One on the liberated platform can achieve unlimited bliss by worshiping the Personality of Godhead, whereas those who are ignorant of the Lord try to find meaning by concocting other objects of worship. If one stubbornly imagines that anything is independent of the Lord, one will remain in the grip of the illusory network of the Lord's potency. Seeing the inevitability of the destruction of material things, one is constantly fearful and perpetually laments in the darkness of ignorance. In such darkness there is no question of happiness. Therefore, one should never think that anything is independent of the Personality of Godhead. As soon as one considers anything to be independent of the Lord, one is immediately gripped by the Lord's illusory network, called mäyä. One should always remain humble and obedient to the Personality of Godhead, even when one is liberated, and thus one will achieve the supreme spiritual happiness.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Çré Uddhava said: O my Lord, a living entity situated within the material body is surrounded by the modes of nature and the happiness and distress that are born of activities caused by these modes. How is it possible that he is not bound by this material encirclement? It may also be said that the living entity is ultimately transcendental and has nothing to do with the material world. Then how is he ever bound by material nature?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Due to the influence of the modes of nature the material body generates fruitive activities, which in turn generate material happiness and distress. This material chain reaction is indicated by the word deha-jeñu. The Personality of Godhead has shown Uddhava that the actual goal of life is liberation, not sense gratification. Although the Lord has indicated that the living entity is liberated by devotional service performed with knowledge and renunciation, Uddhava apparently does not understand the specific means of perfection. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, Uddhava's question implies that we observe even in the activities of liberated souls such external activities as eating, sleeping, walking, hearing, speaking, etc., which are functions of the gross and subtle bodies. Thus, if even liberated souls are situated within the gross and subtle material bodies, then how are they not bound by the material modes of nature? If it is argued that the living entity is like the sky, which never mixes with any other object and therefore is not bound, then one may ask how such a transcendental living entity can ever be bound by material nature. In other words, how would material existence be possible? In order to completely clarify the path of Kåñëa consciousness, Uddhava presents this question to the supreme spiritual authority, Lord Kåñëa. In the kingdom of mäyä there are innumerable speculations about the Supreme Lord, who is variously described as nonexistent, or as possessing material qualities, or as being devoid of all qualities, or as being a neuter object like a eunuch. But through mundane speculation it is not possible to understand the nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore Uddhava wants to clear the path of spiritual liberation so that people can actually understand that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As long as one is affected by the modes of nature, perfect understanding is not possible. Lord Kåñëa will now describe to Uddhava further details of spiritual emancipation on the road back home, back to Kåñëa.</div>

I am not able to understand, therefore, the actual situation of the living entity. You, my Lord, are the best of those who are expert in answering philosophical questions. Please explain to me the symptoms by which one can tell the difference between a living entity who is eternally liberated and one who is eternally conditioned.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In previous verses Lord Kåñëa has explained to Uddhava that an eternally liberated soul is beyond the three modes of material nature. Since a liberated soul is considered to be beyond even the superior mode of goodness, how can he be recognized? By false identification with the modes of nature, which produce one's own material body, one is bound by illusion. On the other hand, by transcending the modes of nature, one is liberated. However, in ordinary activities—such as eating, evacuating, relaxing, sitting and sleeping—a liberated soul and a conditioned soul appear to be the same. Therefore Uddhava is inquiring, "By what symptoms can I recognize that one living entity is performing such external activities without false ego, and by what symptoms can I recognize one who is working under the illusory bondage of material identification? This is difficult, because the ordinary bodily functions of liberated and conditioned personalities appear similar." Uddhava has approached the Supreme Personality of Godhead, taking Him as his personal spiritual master, and wants to be enlightened about how to understand the differences between material and spiritual life.</div>
<div class="First"> Since the living entity is sometimes called eternally conditioned, how could he ever be considered eternally liberated, or vice versa? This is an apparent contradiction, which will be cleared up by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="First"> Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Tenth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Nature of Fruitive Activity."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 11. The Symptoms of Conditioned and Liberated Living</div>
<div class="First"> Entities</div>
<div class="First"> In this chapter, Lord Çré Kåñëa describes to Uddhava the difference between conditioned and liberated living entities, the characteristics of a saintly person and the different aspects of the practice of devotional service. In the previous chapter Uddhava had presented questions regarding conditioned and liberated souls. In His replies, the almighty Lord Çré Kåñëa states that although the spirit soul is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, on account of his infinitesimal nature, he falls into contact with the material energy, which causes him to accept the covering designations of the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. Thus the soul has been bound up since time immemorial. But when he achieves the shelter of pure devotional service, he becomes designated as eternally liberated. Transcendental knowledge is therefore the cause of the living entity's liberation, and ignorance is the cause of his bondage. Both knowledge and ignorance are produced by the mäyä energy of Lord Çré Kåñëa and are His eternal potencies. The living entities who become attracted to the modes of nature are bewildered by false ego, which causes them to see themselves as the enjoyers of misery, confusion, happiness, distress, danger, and so on. In this way, they meditate upon such states of being, although in the real, or spiritual, world these things do not exist. Both the jéva (individual soul) and the Supersoul reside within the same body. The difference between them is that the almighty Supersoul, being fully cognizant, does not indulge in enjoying the fruits of material work but remains simply as a witness, whereas the infinitesimal conditioned jéva, being ignorant, suffers the consequences of his own work. The liberated jéva, in spite of being within a material body because of the remaining reactions of his past activities, does not become disturbed by the happiness and suffering of the body. He sees such bodily experiences in the same way that a person who has just awakened from a dream sees his dream experiences. On the other hand, although the conditioned living entity is by nature not the enjoyer of the happiness and misery of the body, he imagines himself to be the enjoyer of his bodily experiences, just as a person in a dream imagines his dream experiences to be real. Just as the sun reflected upon water is not actually bound up in the water, and just as the air is not confined to some particular segment of the sky, similarly a detached person takes advantage of his broad outlook on the world to cut off all his doubts with the sword of appropriate renunciation, yukta-vairägya. Since his life force, senses, mind and intelligence have no tendency to fix themselves on sense objects, he remains liberated even while situated within the material body. Regardless of whether he is harassed or worshiped, he remains equipoised. He is therefore considered liberated even in this life. A liberated person has nothing to do with the piety and sin of this world, but rather sees everything equally. A self-satisfied sage does not praise or condemn anyone. He does not speak uselessly to anyone and does not fix his mind on material things. Rather, he is always merged in meditation upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, so in the eyes of fools he seems to be a speechless, crazy person. Even if someone has studied or even taught all the different Vedic literatures, if he has not developed pure attraction to the service of the Personality of Godhead, he has accomplished nothing beyond his own labor. One should study only those scriptures in which the nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, His enchanting pastimes and the nectarean topics of His various incarnations are scientifically discussed; thus one gains the highest good fortune. However, by studying scriptures other than these one simply acquires misfortune.</div>
<div class="First"> With full determination one should properly understand the identity of the soul and give up false identification with this material body. He may then offer his heart at the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, Çré Kåñëa, the reservoir of all love, and attain real peace. When the mind is carried away by the three modes of nature, it can no longer meditate properly on the transcendental Supreme Truth. After many lifetimes, faithful persons who have performed Vedic sacrifices for acquiring religiosity, economic development and sense gratification finally engage in hearing, chanting and constantly thinking of the Supreme Lord's all-auspicious pastimes, which purify the entire universe. Such persons then achieve the association of a bona fide spiritual master and the saintly devotees. After that, by the mercy of the spiritual master they begin to follow the paths set out by the standard authorities of spiritual life, the mahäjanas, and become actually perfect in realization of their own true identity.</div>
<div class="First"> Having heard these instructions from Lord Kåñëa, Uddhava further desired to understand the characteristics of a factually saintly person and the different aspects of devotional practice. Lord Kåñëa replied that a real sädhu, or Vaiñëava, is qualified with the following characteristics. He is merciful, nonenvious, always truthful, self-controlled, faultless, magnanimous, gentle, clean, nonpossessive, helpful to all, peaceful, dependent on Kåñëa alone, free from lust, devoid of material endeavor, steady, in control of the six enemies of the mind, moderate in eating, never bewildered, always respectful to others, never desirous of respect for himself, sober, compassionate, friendly, poetic, expert and silent. The principal characteristic of a sädhu is that he takes shelter of Kåñëa alone. One who engages exclusively in Kåñëa's service and understands Him as the limitless, indwelling Lord who comprises eternity, knowledge and bliss, is the topmost devotee. The practice of devotional service includes sixty-four kinds of activities. Among these are: (1-6) seeing, touching, worshiping, serving, glorifying and offering obeisances to the Deity of the Lord and His pure devotees; (7) developing attachment for hearing the chanting of the Lord's qualities, pastimes, and so on; (8) remaining always in meditation upon the Lord; (9) offering everything one acquires to the Lord; (10) accepting oneself to be the Lord's servant; (11) offering the Lord one's heart and soul; (12) engaging in glorification of the Lord's birth and activities; (13) observing holidays related to the Lord; (14) performing festivals in the Lord's temple in the company of other devotees, and with music, singing and dancing; (15) celebrating all varieties of yearly functions; (16) offering foodstuffs to the Lord; (17) taking initiation according to the Vedas and tantras; (18) taking vows related to the Lord; (19) being eager to establish Deities of the Lord; (20) endeavoring either alone or in association with others in constructing, for the service of the Lord, vegetable and flower gardens, temples, cities, and so on; (21) humbly cleansing the temple of the Lord; and (22) rendering service to the Lord's house by painting it, washing it with water and decorating it with auspicious designs.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Uddhava, due to the influence of the material modes of nature, which are under My control, the living entity is sometimes designated as conditioned and sometimes as liberated. In fact, however, the soul is never really bound up or liberated, and since I am the Supreme Lord of mäyä, which is the cause of the modes of nature, I also am never to be considered liberated or in bondage.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In this chapter the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, explains the different characteristics of conditioned and liberated life, the symptoms by which one can recognize saintly persons, and the various processes of devotional service to the Lord. In the previous chapter, Uddhava inquired from the Lord how conditioned and liberated life are possible. The Lord now replies that Uddhava's question is somewhat superficial, since the pure spirit soul is never entangled in the material energy of the Lord. The living entity imagines a false connection with the three modes of nature and accepts the material body as the self. The living entity therefore suffers the consequences of his own imagination, just as one suffers the illusory activities of a dream. This does not indicate that the material world is illusory in the sense that it is nonexistent. The material world is certainly real, being the potency of the Personality of Godhead, and the living entity, being the superior potency of God, is also real. But the living entity's dream of being part and parcel of the material world is an illusion that drags him into the contradictory state called material conditioned life. The living entity is never actually baddha, or bound up, since he merely imagines a false connection with the material world. Because there is ultimately no permanent connection between the living entity and matter, there is no actual liberation. The living entity, being eternally transcendental to the inferior material energy of the Lord, is eternally liberated. Lord Kåñëa reveals that in one sense the living entity is factually not bound up and thus cannot be liberated. But in another sense, the terms bondage and liberation can be conveniently applied to indicate the particular situation of the individual soul, who is the marginal potency of the Lord. Although the individual soul is never actually bound to matter, he suffers the reactions of material nature because of false identification, and thus the term baddha, or "bound up," may be used to indicate the nature of a living entity's experience within the inferior energy of the Lord. Since baddha describes a false situation, freedom from such a false situation may also be described as mokña, or liberation. Therefore the terms bondage and liberation are acceptable if one understands that such terms only refer to temporary situations created by illusion and do not refer to the ultimate nature of the living entity. In this verse Lord Kåñëa states, guëasya mäyä-mülatvän na me mokño na bandhanam: the terms liberation and bondage can never be applied to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, since He is the Absolute Truth and the supreme controller of everything. Lord Kåñëa is eternally the supreme transcendental entity, and He can never be bound by illusion. It is the duty of the illusory potency of the Personality of Godhead to attract the living entities to ignorance by creating the false impression of a blissful existence separate from Lord Kåñëa. The illusory conception of existence apart from the Personality of Godhead is called mäyä, or material illusion. Since Lord Kåñëa is the supreme absolute controller of mäyä, there is no possibility that mäyä could have any influence over the Personality of Godhead. Thus the term bandhanam, or "bondage," cannot be applied to the eternal, blissful and omniscient Personality of Godhead. The term mokña, or "liberation," indicating freedom from bandhana, is equally irrelevant to the Lord. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has commented on this verse as follows. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is endowed with great spiritual potencies. Because of mundane concoction, the conditioned soul imagines that the Absolute Truth is devoid of variegated spiritual potencies by which He may enjoy blissful life. Although the living entity is the spiritual potency of the Lord, he is presently situated in the inferior, illusory potency, and by engaging in mental speculation he becomes bound in conditioned life. Liberation means that the living entity should transfer himself to the spiritual potency of the Lord, which can be divided into three categories—hlädiné, the potency of bliss; sandhiné, the potency of eternal existence; and saàvit, the potency of omniscience. Since the Personality of Godhead is eternally endowed with a pure existence of bliss and knowledge, He is never conditioned or liberated. The living entity, however, being entangled in the Lord's material potency, is sometimes conditioned and sometimes liberated. The neutral, original state of the three modes of nature is called mäyä. When the three modes of nature interact, one of them will become powerful, subordinating the other two modes until another mode becomes prominent. In this way, the three can be distinguished in their variety of manifestation. Although the threefold material potency expands from the Personality of Godhead, the Lord Himself in His personal form is the actual abode of the three spiritual potencies, namely eternality, bliss and knowledge. If one desires to become free from the entanglement of conditioned life within the material sky, called the kingdom of mäyä, one must come to the spiritual sky, wherein the living entities are filled with bliss, possess eternal spiritual bodies and engage in the loving devotional service of the Lord. By developing one's eternal, spiritual form in the loving service of the Lord, one immediately transcends the duality of conditioned life and impersonal liberation and can directly experience the spiritual potencies of the Lord. At that time there is no possibility of false identification with the material world. Realizing oneself to be eternal spirit soul, the living entity can understand that he is never truly connected to matter, because he is part of the superior energy of the Lord. Therefore, both material bondage and liberation are ultimately meaningless within the reality of the spiritual sky. The living entity is the marginal potency of the Lord and should exercise his free will to engage in the pure devotional service of the Lord. By reviving one's eternal, spiritual body one can understand oneself to be a minute particle of the spiritual potency of the Lord. In other words, the living entity is a minute particle of eternity, bliss and omniscience, and thus in full Kåñëa consciousness there is no possibility of his being carried away by the illusion of the three modes of nature. In conclusion, it may be stated that the individual living entity is never actually entangled in matter and is thus not liberated, although his illusory state may be accurately described as entangled and liberated. On the other hand, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally situated in His own spiritual potencies and can never be described as being bound up, and thus there is no meaning to the concept of the Lord's freeing Himself from such a nonexistent condition.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Just as a dream is merely a creation of one's intelligence but has no actual substance, similarly, material lamentation, illusion, happiness, distress and the acceptance of the material body under the influence of mayä are all creations of My illusory energy. In other words, material existence has no essential reality.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word deha-äpattiù indicates that the living entity falsely identifies himself with the external material body and thus transmigrates from one body to another. Äpatti also indicates great suffering or misfortune. Because of such false identification under the influence of illusion, the living entity experiences the miserable symptoms described here. Mäyä means the false concept that anything can exist without Lord Kåñëa or for any purpose other than the pleasure of the Supreme Lord. Although the conditioned living entities are trying to enjoy material sense gratification, the result is always painful, and such painful experiences turn the conditioned soul back toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, the ultimate purpose of the material creation is to bring the living entity back to the loving devotional service of the Lord. Therefore, even the sufferings of the material world may be seen as the transcendental mercy of the Personality of Godhead. The conditioned soul, imagining that material objects are meant for his personal enjoyment, bitterly laments the loss of such objects. In this verse, the example is given of a dream in which the material intelligence creates many illusory objects. Similarly, our polluted material consciousness creates the false impression of material sense gratification, but this phantasmagoria, being devoid of Kåñëa consciousness, has no real existence. By surrendering to polluted material consciousness, the living entity is afflicted with innumerable troubles. The only solution is to see Lord Kåñëa within everything and everything within Lord Kåñëa. Thus, one understands that Lord Kåñëa is the supreme enjoyer, the proprietor of everything and the well-wishing friend of all living beings.</div>
<div class="First"> In material illusion there is no understanding of one's eternal, spiritual body, nor is there knowledge of the Absolute Truth. Therefore, material existence, even in its most sophisticated or pious form, is always foolishness. One should not misunderstand the example of the dream to mean that the material world has no real existence. Material nature is the manifestation of the Lord's external potency, just as the spiritual sky is the manifestation of the Lord's internal potency. Although material objects are subject to transformation and thus have no permanent existence, the material energy is real because it comes from the supreme reality, Lord Kåñëa. It is only our false acceptance of the material body as the factual self and our foolish dream that the material world is meant for our pleasure that have no real existence. They are merely mental concoctions. One should cleanse oneself of material designations and wake up to the all-pervading reality of the Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa.</div>

<div class="First"> By the expansion of vidyä, or knowledge, a conditioned soul is liberated from the clutches of mäyä, and similarly, by the expansion of avidyä, or ignorance, the conditioned soul is driven further into illusion and bondage. Both knowledge and ignorance are products of the mighty potency of the Personality of Godhead. The living being is bound by illusion when he considers himself the proprietor of the subtle and gross material bodies. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé the living entity may be designated as jéva-mäyä, whereas matter is called guëa-mäyä. The living entity places his living potency (jéva-mäyä) in the grip of the mundane qualitative potency (guëa-mäyä) and falsely dreams that he is part and parcel of the material world. Such an artificial mixture is called illusion or ignorance. When all of the Lord's potencies are correctly perceived in their proper categories, the living entity is liberated from material bondage and returns to his blissful eternal residence in the spiritual sky.</div>
<div class="First"> The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not different from His potencies, yet He is always above them as the supreme controller. The Supreme Personality of Godhead may be designated as mukta, or liberated, only to indicate that He is eternally free from material contamination and never to indicate that the Lord has been freed from actual entanglement in a material situation. According to Çréla Madhväcärya, vidyä indicates the goddess of fortune, the internal potency of the Lord, whereas avidyä indicates Durgä, the external potency of the Lord. Ultimately, however, the Personality of Godhead can transform His potencies according to His own desire, as explained by Çréla Prabhupäda in his commentary on Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.3.34), "Because the Lord is the absolute Transcendence, all of His forms, names, pastimes, attributes, associates and energies are identical with Him. His transcendental energy acts according to His omnipotency. The same energy acts as His external, internal and marginal energies, and by His omnipotency He can perform anything and everything through the agency of any of the above energies. He can turn the external energy into internal by His will." Çréla Çrédhara Svämé notes in this regard that although the Lord has explained in the first verse of this chapter that the living entity is never actually in bondage, and therefore never actually liberated, one may apply the terms bondage and liberation if one remembers that the living entity is eternally a transcendental fragment of the Personality of Godhead. Further, one should not misinterpret the words mäyayä me vinirmite to indicate that both material bondage and liberation are temporary states, being creations of the potency of the Lord. Therefore, the term ädye, or "primeval and eternal" is used in this verse. The vidyä and avidyä potencies of the Lord are stated to be creations of mäyä because they carry out the functions of the Lord's potencies. The vidyä potency engages the living entities in the Lord's pastimes, whereas the avidyä potency engages the living entities in forgetting the Lord and merging into darkness. Actually, both knowledge and ignorance are eternal alternatives of the marginal potency of the Lord, and in this sense it is not incorrect to state that the living entity is either eternally conditioned or eternally liberated. The term vinirmite, or "produced," in this case indicates that the Lord expands His own energy as knowledge and ignorance, which display the functions of the Lord's internal and external potencies. Such potential exhibitions may appear and disappear in different times, places and circumstances, but material bondage and spiritual freedom are eternal options of the marginal potency of the Lord.</div>

<div class="First"> Just as the sun reveals itself through its own light or covers itself by creating clouds, the Personality of Godhead reveals and covers Himself by knowledge and ignorance, which are expansions of His potency. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (7.5):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">apareyam itas tv anyäà</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">yayedaà dhäryate jagat</div>
<div class="First"> "Besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine, consisting of all living entities who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe." Çréla Prabhupäda states in connection with this verse: "The Supreme Lord Kåñëa is the only controller, and all living entities are controlled by Him. These living entities are His superior energy because the quality of their existence is one and the same with the Supreme, but they are never equal to the Lord in quantity of power." Because of quantitative inferiority of potency, the living entity becomes covered by mäyä and is again liberated by surrendering to the Lord. The word aàça, or "part and parcel" is also mentioned in Bhagavad-gétä (15.7): mamaiväàço jéva-loke jéva-bhütaù sanätanaù. The living entity is aàça, or a minute particle, and therefore subject to liberation and bondage. As stated in the Viñëu Puräëa:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">viñëu-çaktiù parä proktä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kñetra-jïäkhyä tathä parä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">avidyä-karma-saàjïänyä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tåtéyä çaktir iñyate</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">[Cc. Madhya 6.154]</div>
<div class="First"> "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu, possesses His superior internal potency as well as the potency called kñetrajïä çakti. This kñetrajïä çakti is also spiritual potency, but it is sometimes covered by the third, or material, potency called ignorance. Thus because of the various stages of covering, the second, or marginal, potency is manifested in different evolutionary phases." Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura has written that the living entity has been executing fruitive activities since time immemorial. Thus his conditioned life may be called beginningless. Such conditioned life, however, is not endless, since the living entity may achieve liberation through the loving devotional service of the Lord. Since the living entity may acquire liberation, Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura states that his liberated life begins at a certain point but is endless, because liberated life is understood to be eternal. In any case, one who has achieved the shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, may be understood to be eternally liberated, since such a person has entered into the eternal atmosphere of the spiritual sky. Since there is no material time in the spiritual sky, one who has achieved his eternal spiritual body on Lord Kåñëa's planet is not subject to the influence of time. His eternal blissful life with Kåñëa is not designated in terms of material past, present and future and is therefore called eternal liberation. Material time is conspicuous by its absence in the spiritual sky, and every living entity there is eternally liberated, having attained the supreme situation. Such liberation can be achieved by vidyä, or perfect knowledge, which is understood in three phases called Brahman, Paramätmä and Bhagavän, as described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam. The ultimate phase of vidyä, or knowledge, is to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-gétä such knowledge is called räja-vidyä, or the king of all knowledge, and it awards the supreme liberation.</div>

<div class="First"> In verse 36 of the previous chapter, Uddhava inquired about the different symptoms of liberated and conditioned life. Çréla Çrédhara Svämé explains that the characteristics of bondage and liberation may be understood in two divisions—as the difference between the ordinary conditioned soul and the eternally liberated Personality of Godhead, or as the difference between conditioned and liberated living entities in the jéva category. The Lord will first explain the difference between the ordinary living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which may be understood as the difference between the controlled and the controller.</div>

<div class="Translation"> By chance, two birds have made a nest together in the same tree. The two birds are friends and are of a similar nature. One of them, however, is eating the fruits of the tree, whereas the other, who does not eat the fruits, is in a superior position due to His potency.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The example of two birds in the same tree is given to illustrate the presence within the heart of the material body of both the individual soul and the Supersoul, the Personality of Godhead. Just as a bird makes a nest in a tree, the living entity sits within the heart. The example is appropriate because the bird is always distinct from the tree. Similarly, both the individual soul and the Supersoul are distinct entities, separate from the temporary material body. The word balena indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is satisfied by His own internal potency, which consists of eternality, omniscience and bliss. As indicated by the word bhüyän, or "having superior existence," the Supreme Lord is always in a superior position, whereas the living entity is sometimes in illusion and sometimes enlightened. The word balena indicates that the Lord is never in darkness or ignorance, but is always full in His perfect, blissful consciousness.</div>
<div class="First"> Thus, the Lord is niranna, or uninterested in the bitter fruits of material activities, whereas the ordinary conditioned soul busily consumes such bitter fruits, thinking them to be sweet. Ultimately, the fruit of all material endeavor is death, hut the living entity foolishly thinks material things will bring him pleasure. The word sakhäyau, or "two friends," is also significant. Our real friend is Lord Kåñëa, who is situated within our heart. Only He knows our actual needs, and only He can give us real happiness. Lord Kåñëa is so kind that He patiently sits in the heart, trying to guide the conditioned soul back home, back to Godhead. Certainly no material friend would remain with his foolish companion for millions of years, especially if his companion were to ignore him or even curse him. But Lord Kåñëa is such a faithful, loving friend that He accompanies even the most demoniac living entity and is also in the heart of the insect, pig and dog. That is because Lord Kåñëa is supremely Kåñëa conscious and sees every living entity as part and parcel of Himself. Every living being should give up the bitter fruits of the tree of material existence. One should turn one's face to the Lord within the heart and revive one's eternal loving relationship with one's real friend, Lord Kåñëa. The word sadåçau, or "of similar nature," indicates that both the living entity and the Personality of Godhead are conscious entities. As part and parcel of the Lord we share the Lord's nature, but in infinitesimal quantity. Thus the Lord and the living entity are sadåçau. A similar statement is found in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad (4.6):</div>

<div class="Translation"> The bird who does not eat the fruits of the tree is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who by His omniscience perfectly understands His own position and that of the conditioned living entity, represented by the eating bird. That living entity, on the other hand, does not understand himself or the Lord. He is covered by ignorance and is thus called eternally conditioned, whereas the Personality of Godhead, being full of perfect knowledge, is eternally liberated.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word vidyä-maya in this verse indicates the internal potency of the Lord and not the external potency, mahä-mäyä. Within the material world there is vidyä, or material science, and avidyä, or material ignorance, but in this verse vidyä means the internal spiritual knowledge by which the Personality of Godhead is fixed in omniscience. The example of two birds in a tree, which is given in many Vedic literatures, demonstrates the statement nityo nityänäm: there are two categories of eternal living entities, namely the Supreme Lord and the minute jéva soul. The conditioned jéva soul, forgetting his identity as an eternal servant of the Lord, tries to enjoy the fruits of his own activities and thus comes under the spell of ignorance. This bondage of ignorance has existed since time immemorial and can be rectified only by one's taking to the loving devotional service of the Lord, which is full of spiritual knowledge. In conditioned life the living entity is forced by the laws of nature to engage in pious and impious fruitive activities, but the liberated position of every living entity is to offer the fruits of his work to the Lord, the supreme enjoyer. It should be understood that even when the living entity is in a liberated condition, his knowledge is never equal in quantity to that of the Personality of Godhead. Even Lord Brahmä, the supreme living entity within this universe, acquires only partial knowledge of the Personality of Godhead and His potencies. In Bhagavad-gétä (4.5), the Lord explains His superior knowledge to Arjuna:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bahüni me vyatétäni</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">janmäni tava cärjuna</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">täny ahaà veda sarväëi</div>

<div class="First"> "The Blessed Lord said: Many, many births both you and I have passed. I can remember all of them, but you cannot, O subduer of the enemy!" The term baddha, or "bound," is also understood to refer to the living entity's eternal dependence upon the Lord, either in the conditioned or liberated state. In the kingdom of mäyä the living entity is bound to the cruel laws of birth and death, whereas in the spiritual sky the living entity is fixed in a bond of love to the Lord. Liberation means freedom from the miseries of life, but never freedom from one's loving relationship with Lord Kåñëa, which is the essence of one's eternal existence. According to Çréla Madhväcärya, the Lord is the only eternally free living entity, and all other living entities are eternally dependent and bound to the Lord, either through blissful loving service or through the bondage of mäyä. The conditioned soul should give up tasting the bitter fruits of the tree of material existence and turn to his dearmost friend, Lord Kåñëa, who is sitting within his heart. There is no pleasure equal to or greater than the pleasure of pure devotional service to Lord Kåñëa, and by tasting the fruit of love of Kåñëa, the liberated living entity enters the ocean of happiness.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In Lord Kåñëa's discussion of the different characteristics of liberated and conditioned souls, the Lord first clarified the distinction between the eternally liberated Personality of Godhead and the marginal potency, the innumerable jévas, who are sometimes conditioned and sometimes liberated. In this and the next nine verses, the Lord describes the different symptoms of liberated and conditioned jéva souls. In a dream one sees oneself in an imaginary body, but upon waking one gives up all identification with that body. Similarly, one who has awakened to Kåñëa consciousness no longer identifies with the gross or subtle material bodies, nor does he become affected by the happiness and distress of material life. On the other hand, a foolish person (kumati) does not awaken from the dream of material existence and is afflicted with innumerable problems due to false identification with the gross and subtle material bodies. One should become situated in one's eternal spiritual identity (nitya-svarüpa). By properly identifying oneself as the eternal servant of Kåñëa, one becomes relieved of his false material identity, and therefore the miseries of illusory existence immediately cease, just as the anxiety of a troublesome dream ceases as soon as one awakens to his normal, pleasant surroundings. It should be understood, however, that the analogy of awakening from a dream can never be applied to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is never in illusion. The Lord is eternally awake and enlightened in His own unique category called viñëu-tattva. Such knowledge is easily understood by one who is vidvän, or enlightened in Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="First"> "One who is in knowledge of the Absolute Truth, O mighty-armed, does not engage himself in the senses and sense gratification, knowing well the difference between work in devotion and work for fruitive results." The material body always interacts with the sense objects, for in order to survive the body must eat, drink, speak, sleep, and so on, but an enlightened person who knows the science of Kåñëa consciousness never thinks, "I am accepting these sense objects as my property. They are meant for my pleasure." Similarly, if the body performs a wonderful activity, a Kåñëa conscious person does not become proud, nor is he depressed by the failure of the body to function in a particular way. In other words, Kåñëa consciousness means giving up identification with the gross and subtle material bodies. One should see them as the external energy of the Lord, working under the direction of the Lord's empowered representative mäyä. One absorbed in fruitive activities works under the jurisdiction of mahä-mäyä, or the external illusory potency, and experiences the miseries of material existence. On the other hand, a devotee works under the internal potency, called yoga-mäyä, and remains satisfied by offering his loving service to the Lord. In either case, the Lord Himself, by His multifarious potencies, is the ultimate performer of action. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, one who claims to be transcendental to the bodily concept of life, but at the same time remains under the influence of material desire and mental transformation, is understood to be a cheater and the lowest type of conditioned soul.</div>

A self-realized soul, however, studies the inevitable defeat and suffering of ordinary persons and does not make the mistake of trying to enjoy the bodily functions even slightly. He instead remains a detached witness, merely engaging his senses in the normal functions of bodily maintenance.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is Lord Kåñëa, and there is no possibility of any existence separate from Lord Kåñëa. Such expert knowledge cuts all doubts to pieces. As stated here, prakåti-stho 'py asaàsaktaù: like the sky, the sun or the wind, one who is self-realized is not entangled, though situated within the material creation of the Lord. Nänätva, or "material variety," refers to one's material body, the bodies of others and the unlimited paraphernalia for bodily sense gratification, both physical and mental. By awakening to Kåñëa consciousness, one completely retires from illusory sense gratification and becomes absorbed in the progressive realization of the soul situated within the body. As revealed in the example of the two birds in a tree, both the individual soul and the Personality of Godhead are completely separate from the gross and subtle material bodies. If one turns one's face to the Lord, recognizing one's eternal dependence on Him, there will be no further suffering or anxiety, even though one is still situated within the material world. The unlimited experiences of material objects only increase one's anxiety, whereas perception of the Absolute Truth, Çré Kåñëa, immediately brings one to the platform of peace. Thus one who is intelligent retires from the world of matter and becomes a fully self-realized Kåñëa conscious person.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Sometimes for no apparent reason one's body is attacked by cruel people or violent animals.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> If one does not become angry when attacked for no apparent reason, and if one does not become enlivened when glorified or worshiped, then one has passed the test of self-realization and is considered fixed in spiritual intelligence. Uddhava asked Lord Kåñëa, kair vä jïäyeta lakñaëaiù: by what symptoms can a self-realized person be recognized? Just as Lord Kåñëa enlightened Arjuna, He now explains the same subject matter to Uddhava. In this verse the Lord describes symptoms by which it is very easy to recognize a saintly person, for a normal person becomes furious when criticized or attacked and overwhelmed with joy when glorified by others. There is a similar statement by Yäjïavalkya to the effect that one who is actually intelligent does not become angry though pricked with thorns and does not become satisfied at heart merely by being worshiped with auspicious paraphernalia such as sandalwood.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, this verse describes a type of discipline recommended for the jïäna-yogés, who by intelligence try to understand that they are not their material bodies. One who is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, however, accepts and rejects material things in terms of their usefulness in the loving service of Lord Kåñëa. One who is trying to preach Kåñëa consciousness should be seen as very intelligent and not jaòa-vat, or stunted, as described here. Although a devotee of the Lord does not act, speak or contemplate for his personal sense gratification, he remains very busy working, speaking and meditating in the devotional service of the Lord. The devotee makes elaborate plans to engage all the fallen souls in Lord Kåñëa's service so they can be purified and go back home, back to Godhead. Merely rejecting material things is not perfect consciousness. One must see everything as the property of the Lord and meant for the Lord's pleasure. One busily engaged in spreading the Kåñëa consciousness movement has no time to make material distinctions and thus automatically comes to the liberated platform.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> If through meticulous study one becomes expert in reading Vedic literature but makes no endeavor to fix one's mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then one's endeavor is certainly like that of a man who works very hard to take care of a cow that gives no milk. In other words, the fruit of one's laborious study of Vedic knowledge will simply be the labor itself. There will be no other tangible result.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains that the word pare ("the Supreme") in this verse indicates the Supreme Personality of Godhead rather than the impersonal Brahman, because Lord Kåñëa, the speaker of these instructions, makes references in later verses to His personality as the Supreme. An impersonal interpretation in this case would be eka-deçänvaya uttara-çlokärtha-tätparya-virodhaù, or a contradictory interpretation that creates illogical conflict with other çlokas (verses) spoken in the same context. It requires great endeavor to take care of a cow. One must either grow food grains to feed the cow or maintain suitable pastures. If the pasture is not properly maintained, poisonous weeds will grow, or snakes will multiply, and there will be danger. Cows are infected by many types of diseases and bugs and must be regularly cleaned and disinfected. Similarly, fences must be maintained around the cow pasture, and there is even more work to be done. If the cow gives no milk, however, then one certainly performs hard labor with no tangible result. Laborious effort is also required to learn the Sanskrit language well enough to discern the subtle and esoteric meaning of the Vedic mantras. If after such great labor one does not understand the spiritual body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which is the source of all happiness in life, and if one does not surrender to the Lord as the supreme shelter of all things, then one has certainly labored hard with no tangible result other than his own labor. Even a liberated soul who has given up the bodily concept of life will fall down if he does not take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The word niñëäta, or "expert," indicates that one must ultimately achieve the goal of life; otherwise one is not expert. As stated by Caitanya Mahäprabhu, premä pum-artho mahän: the actual goal of human life is love of Godhead, and no one can be considered expert without achieving this goal.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> My dear Uddhava, that man is certainly most miserable who takes care of a cow that gives no milk, an unchaste wife, a body totally dependent on others, useless children or wealth not utilized for the right purpose. Similarly, one who studies Vedic knowledge devoid of My glories is also most miserable.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> A human being is actually learned or expert when he understands that all material objects perceived through the various senses are expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that nothing exists without the support of the Supreme Lord. In this verse, through various examples, it is concluded that the power of speech is useless if not engaged in the support of the Supreme Lord. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, this verse implies that all of the functions of the various senses are useless if they are not engaged in the glorification of God. Indeed, the avadhüta brähmaëa previously stated to King Yadu that if the tongue is not controlled, one's entire program of sense control is a failure. One cannot control the tongue unless he vibrates the glories of the Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> The example of the milkless cow is significant. A gentleman never kills a cow, and therefore when a cow becomes sterile and no longer gives milk, one must engage in the laborious task of protecting her, since no one will purchase a useless cow. For some time, the greedy owner of a sterile cow may continue thinking, "I have already invested so much money in taking care of this cow, and certainly in the near future she will again become pregnant and give milk." But when this hope is proven futile, he becomes neglectful and indifferent to the health and safety of the animal. Because of such sinful neglect, he must suffer in the next life, after having already suffered because of the sterile cow in the present life.</div>
<div class="First"> Similarly, although a man may discover that his wife is neither chaste nor affectionate, he may be so eager to get children that he goes on taking care of such a useless wife, thinking, "I will teach my wife the religious duties of a chaste woman. By hearing historical examples of great women surely her heart will change, and she will become a wonderful wife to me." Unfortunately, the unchaste wife in many cases does not change and also gives a man many useless children who are just as foolish and irreligious as she. Such children never give any happiness to the father, yet the father tediously labors to take care of them.</div>
<div class="First"> Also, one who has accumulated wealth by the mercy of God must be vigilant to give in charity to the right person and for the right cause. If such a right person or cause appears and one hesitates and selfishly does not give in charity, one loses his reputation, and in the next life he will be poverty-stricken. One who fails to give properly in charity spends his life anxiously protecting his wealth, which ultimately brings him no fame or happiness.</div>
<div class="First"> The previous examples are given to illustrate the uselessness of laboriously studying Vedic knowledge that does not glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé comments that the spiritual vibration of the Vedas is meant to bring one to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa. Many processes for achieving the Supreme Truth are recommended in the Upaniñads and other Vedic literatures, but because of their innumerable and seemingly contradictory explanations, commentaries and injunctions, one cannot achieve the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, merely by reading such literature. If, however, one understands Çré Kåñëa to be the ultimate cause of all causes and reads the Upaniñads and other Vedic literature as glorification of the Supreme Lord, then one can actually become fixed at the Lord's lotus feet. For example, His Divine Grace Çréla Prabhupäda translated and commented upon Çré Éçopaniñad in such a way that it brings the reader closer to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Undoubtedly, the lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa are the only reliable boat by which to cross the turbulent ocean of material existence. Even Lord Brahmä has stated in the Tenth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam that if one gives up the auspicious path of bhakti and takes to the fruitless labor of Vedic speculation, one is just like a fool who beats empty husks in hopes of getting rice. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé recommends that one completely ignore dry Vedic speculation because it does not bring one to the point of devotional service to the Absolute Truth, Lord Çré Kåñëa.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear Uddhava, an intelligent person should never take to literatures that do not contain descriptions of My activities, which purify the whole universe. Indeed, I create, maintain and annihilate the entire material manifestation. Among all My pastime incarnations, the most beloved are Kåñëa and Balaräma. Any so-called knowledge that does not recognize these activities of Mine is simply barren and is not acceptable to those who are actually intelligent.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The words lélävatärepsita-janma are very significant here. The Lord's incarnation for executing wonderful pastimes is called lélävatära, and such wonderful forms of Viñëu are glorified by the names Rämacandra, Nåsiàhadeva, Kürma, Varäha, and so on. Among all such lélävatäras, however, the most beloved, even to this day, is Lord Kåñëa, the original source of the viñëu-tattva. The Lord appears in the prison house of Kaàsa and is immediately transferred to the rural setting of Våndävana, where He exhibits unique childhood pastimes with His cowherd boyfriends, girl friends, parents and well-wishers. After some time, the Lord's pastimes are transferred to Mathurä and Dvärakä, and the extraordinary love of the inhabitants of Våndävana is exhibited in their anguished separation from Lord Kåñëa. Such pastimes of the Lord are épsita, or the reservoir of all loving exchanges with the Absolute Truth. The pure devotees of the Lord are most intelligent and expert and do not pay any attention to useless, fruitless literatures that neglect the highest truth, Lord Kåñëa. Although such literatures are very popular among materialistic persons all over the world, they are completely neglected by the community of pure Vaiñëavas. In this verse the Lord explains that the literatures approved for the devotees are those that glorify the Lord's pastimes as the puruña-avatära and the lélävatäras, culminating in the personal appearance of Lord Kåñëa Himself, as confirmed in Brahma-saàhitä (5.39):</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Although in previous verses Lord Kåñëa has described the life-style and approach of the impersonal philosophers who meditate on the distinction between matter and spirit, the Lord here rejects the path of jïäna, or speculation, and comes to the final conclusion, bhakti-yoga. The path of jïäna is interesting only to one who does not know that Lord Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä (7.19):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bahünäà janmanäm ante</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">jïänavän mäm prapadyate</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">väsudevaù sarvam iti</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sa mahätmä su-durlabhaù</div>
<div class="First"> The words väsudevaù sarvam iti, or "Väsudeva is everything," are similar to the words sarva-ge found in this verse. One should know why the Personality of Godhead is all-pervading. The first verse of Çrémad-Bhägavatam states, janmädy asya yataù: [SB 1.1.1] the Supreme Lord is the source of everything. And as stated in the previous verse of this chapter, He creates, maintains and annihilates everything. Thus the Lord is not all-pervading in the manner of air or sunlight; rather, the Lord is all-pervading as the absolute controller who holds in His hands the destiny of every living entity. Everything is ultimately an expansion of Kåñëa, and therefore there is really no other object of meditation besides Kåñëa. Meditation upon any other object is also meditation on Kåñëa but is imperfectly performed, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä by the word avidhi-pürvakam. The Lord also states in the Gétä that all living entities are on the path back home, back to Godhead. Because of ignorance, however, some of them go backward or stop along the way, foolishly thinking that their journey is finished, when in fact they are suspended in one of the minor potencies of the Supreme Lord. If one wants to intimately understand the nature of the Absolute Truth, one must take to the path of love of Godhead. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (18.55):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yävän yaç cäsmi tattvataù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tato mäà tattvato jïätvä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">viçate tad-anantaram</div>
<div class="First"> "One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service. And when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God."</div>
<div class="First"> The words nänätva-bhramam in this verse indicate false identification with the gross and subtle material bodies. The word bhramam indicates a mistake; it can also mean "wandering" or "rotating." The conditioned living entity, because of his mistake of falling into illusion, is wandering through a succession of material bodies, sometimes appearing as a demigod and sometimes as a worm in stool. The word upärameta means that one should stop such fruitless wandering and fix one's mind on the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Lord, who is the true object of everyone's love. Such a conclusion is not sentimental but is the result of keen analytic intelligence (jijïäsayä). Thus after elaborately explaining to Uddhava many aspects of analytic knowledge, the Lord now comes to the ultimate conclusion, Kåñëa consciousness, pure love of Godhead. Without such love there is no question of eternally fixing one's mind on the Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> Quoting from the Viveka, Çréla Madhväcärya states that nänätva-bhramam indicates the following illusions: considering the living entity to be the Supreme; considering all living entities to be ultimately one entity without separate individuality; considering that there are many Gods; thinking that Kåñëa is not God; and considering that the material universe is the ultimate reality. All of these illusions are called bhrama, or mistakes, but such ignorance can be eliminated at once by the chanting of the holy names of Kåñëa: Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear Uddhava, if you are not able to free your mind from all material disturbance and thus absorb it completely on the spiritual platform, then perform all your activities as an offering to Me, without trying to enjoy the fruits.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> If one offers one's activities to Lord Kåñëa without trying to enjoy the results, one's mind becomes purified. When the mind is purified, transcendental knowledge automatically manifests, since such knowledge is a by-product of pure consciousness. When the mind is absorbed in perfect knowledge, it can be raised to the spiritual platform, as described in Bhagavad-gétä (18.54):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">brahma-bhütaù prasannätmä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na çocati na känkñati</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">samaù sarveñu bhüteñu</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mad-bhaktià labhate paräm</div>
<div class="First"> "One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me." By absorbing the mind in the transcendental form of Lord Kåñëa, one can surpass the stage of ordinary transcendental knowledge, by which one simply distinguishes oneself from the gross and subtle material bodies. Spiritually enriched by loving devotional service to the Lord, the mind is completely purified of all tinges of illusion. Through intense concentration on one's relationship with the Personality of Godhead one comes to the highest standard of knowledge and becomes an intimate associate of the Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="First"> By offering one's activities to the Personality of Godhead, one purifies one's mind to some extent and thus comes to the preliminary stage of spiritual awareness. Yet even then one may not be able to fix one's mind completely on the spiritual platform. At that point one should realistically assess one's position, noting the lingering material contamination within the mind. Then, as stated in this verse, one should intensify one's practical devotional work in the service of the Lord. If one artificially considers oneself to be supremely liberated or if one becomes casual on the path of spiritual advancement, there is serious danger of a falldown.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the Lord previously explained to Uddhava jïäna-miçrä bhakti, or devotional service mixed with the impure desire to enjoy transcendental knowledge. In this verse the Lord clearly reveals that transcendental knowledge is an automatic by-product of loving service to the Lord, and in the next verse the Lord begins His explanation of pure devotional service, which is completely sufficient for self-realization. The desire to enjoy spiritual knowledge is certainly a material desire, since the goal is one's personal satisfaction and not the pleasure of the Supreme Lord. Therefore Lord Kåñëa here warns Uddhava that if one is not able to fix one's mind in trance on the spiritual platform, then one should not go on simply theoretically discussing what is Brahman and what is not Brahman. Rather, one should engage in practical devotional service to the Supreme Lord, and then spiritual knowledge will automatically awaken in one's heart. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (10.10):</div>

<div class="First"> Similarly, in the Tenth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam Lord Brahmä warns that one should not neglect the auspicious path of bhakti and instead take up the useless labor of mental speculation. By mere philosophical speculation one cannot fix one's mind on the spiritual platform. Many great philosophers throughout history had abominable personal habits, which proves that they could not fix themselves on the spiritual platform by mere speculation on philosophical categories. If one is not fortunate enough to have executed devotional service to the Lord in one's past life, and if one is therefore addicted to mere speculation on the differences between matter and spirit, one will not be able to fix one's mind on the spiritual platform. Such a person should give up useless speculation and engage in the practical work of Kåñëa consciousness, absorbing himself twenty-four hours a day in the mission of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In such missionary work for the Lord's sake, one should never try to enjoy the fruits of one's work. Even though the mind is not completely pure, if one offers the fruits of one's work to the Lord, the mind will quickly come to the standard of pure desirelessness, in which one's only desire is the Lord's satisfaction.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Jéva Gosvämé states that if one does not have faith in the personal form and activities of the Personality of Godhead, one will not have the spiritual strength to remain perpetually on the transcendental platform. In this verse the Lord is definitely bringing Uddhava, and all living entities, to the conclusion of all philosophy—pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa.</div>
<div class="First"> In this regard, Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura points out that one who is bewildered by false ego may not want to offer his activities to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even though this is the actual way of rising above the influence of the modes of material nature. Because of ignorance one does not know that he is the eternal servant of Kåñëa and instead is attracted by the duality of material illusion. One cannot become free from such illusion by theoretical speculation, but if one offers one's work to the Personality of Godhead, one will clearly understand his eternal, transcendental position as a servant of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear Uddhava, narrations of My pastimes and qualities are all-auspicious and purify the entire universe. A faithful person who constantly hears, glorifies and remembers such transcendental activities, who through dramatic performances relives My pastimes, beginning with My appearance, and who takes full shelter of Me, dedicating his religious, sensual and occupational activities for My satisfaction, certainly obtains unflinching devotional service to Me, the eternal Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Those who have faith only in the impersonal effulgent aspect of the Supreme Lord and those who have faith only in the localized Supersoul, the perfect object of mystic meditation located in the heart of every living entity, are considered to be limited and imperfect in their transcendental realization. The process of mystic meditation and impersonal philosophical speculation are both devoid of actual love of God and therefore cannot be considered to be the perfection of human life. Only one who places full faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes qualified to go back home, back to Godhead. Lord Kåñëa's pastimes of stealing butter from the elderly gopés, enjoying life with His cowherd boyfriends and the young gopés, playing His flute and engaging in the räsa dance, etc., are all-auspicious spiritual activities, and they are fully described in the Tenth Canto of this work. There are many authorized songs and prayers glorifying these pastimes of the Lord, and by constantly chanting them one will automatically be fixed in smaraëam, or remembrance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord exhibited His opulences upon His birth in Kaàsa's prison and at the birth ceremony subsequently performed by Nanda Mahäräja in Gokula. The Lord further performed many adventurous activities, such as chastising the serpent Käliya and many other irresponsible demons. One should regularly take part in the ceremonies commemorating Kåñëa's pastimes, such as the Janmäñöamé celebration glorifying the Lord's birth. On such days one should worship the Deity of Lord Kåñëa and the spiritual master and thus remember the Lord's pastimes.</div>
<div class="First"> The word dharma in this verse indicates that one's religious activities should always be in connection with Kåñëa. Therefore, one should give charity in the form of food grains, clothing, etc., to the Vaiñëavas and brähmaëas, and whenever possible one should arrange for the protection of cows, who are very dear to the Lord. The word käma indicates that one should satisfy one's desires with the transcendental paraphernalia of the Lord. One should eat mahä-prasädam, food offered to the Deity of Lord Kåñëa, and one should also decorate oneself with the Lord's flower garlands and sandalwood pulp and should place the remnants of the Deity's clothing on one's body. One who lives in a luxurious mansion or apartment should convert his residence into a temple of Lord Kåñëa and invite others to come, chant before the Deity, hear Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam and taste the remnants of the Lord's food, or one may live in a beautiful temple building in the community of Vaiñëavas and engage in the same activities. The word artha in this verse indicates that one who is inclined toward business should accumulate money to promote the missionary work of the Lord's devotees and not for one's personal sense gratification. Thus one's business activities are also considered to be devotional service to Lord Kåñëa. The word niçcaläm indicates that since Lord Kåñëa is eternally fixed in perfect knowledge and bliss, there is no possibility of disturbance for one who worships the Lord. If we worship anything except the Lord, our worship may be disturbed when our worshipable deity is placed in an awkward position. But because the Lord is supreme, our worship of Him is eternally free of disturbance.</div>
<div class="First"> One who engages in hearing, glorifying, remembering and dramatically recreating the pastimes of the Lord will soon be freed from all material desire. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé mentions in this connection that one who is advanced in Kåñëa consciousness may specifically be attracted to the pastimes of a devotee in the spiritual world who serves the Lord in a particular way. An advanced devotee in this world may desire to serve the Lord in the same way and thus may take pleasure in dramatically reliving the service of his worshipable devotee-master in the spiritual world. Also, one may take pleasure in spiritual festivals, performances of particular pastimes of Lord Kåñëa, or activities of other devotees of the Lord. In this way, one can continually increase one's faith in the Personality of Godhead. Those who have no desire to hear, glorify or remember the transcendental activities of the Lord are certainly materially polluted and never achieve the highest perfection. Such persons spoil the opportunity of human life by devoting themselves to fleeting mundane topics that produce no eternal benefit. The real meaning of religion is to constantly serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose form is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge. One who has taken full shelter of the Lord is completely uninterested in impersonal speculations about the nature of God and uses his time to advance more and more in the unlimited bliss of pure devotional service.</div>

<div class="Translation"> One who has obtained pure devotional service by association with My devotees always engages in worshiping Me. Thus he very easily goes to My abode, which is revealed by My pure devotees.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In the previous verses Lord Kåñëa has emphasized the value of surrendering to Him in loving service. One may ask how such surrender or devotion is actually achieved. The Lord gives the answer in this verse. One must live in a society of devotees, and thus automatically one will be engaged twenty-four hours a day in the various processes of devotional service, beginning with çravaëam, kértanam and smaraëam (hearing, glorifying and remembering the Lord) [SB 7.5.23]. The pure devotees of the Lord can reveal the spiritual world by their transcendental sound vibration, making it possible for even a neophyte devotee to experience the Lord's abode. Being thus enlivened, the neophyte makes further progress and gradually becomes qualified to personally serve the Personality of Godhead in the spiritual world. By constantly associating with devotees and learning from them about devotional science, one quickly achieves a deep attachment for the Lord and the Lord's service, and such attachment gradually matures into pure love of Godhead. Foolish persons say that the various mantras composed of names of God, as well as all other mantras, are merely material creations with no special value, and therefore any so-called mantra or mystical process will ultimately produce the same result. To refute such superficial thinking, the Lord here describes the science of going back home, back to Godhead. One should not accept the bad association of impersonalists, who state that the holy name, form, qualities and pastimes of the Lord are mäyä, or illusion. Mäyä is actually an insignificant potency of the almighty Personality of Godhead, and if one ignorantly tries to elevate illusion above the Absolute Truth, one will never experience love of Godhead and will be cast into deep forgetfulness of the Lord. One should not associate with those who are envious of the fortunate devotees who are going back to Godhead. Such envious persons deride the abode of the Lord, which is revealed by the pure devotees to those who have faith in the Lord's message. Envious persons create disturbances among the people in general, who should take shelter of the faithful devotees of the Lord. Unless people hear from pure devotees, it is impossible for them to understand that there is a Supreme Personality of Godhead eternally existing in His own abode, which is self-luminous, full of bliss and knowledge. In this verse, the importance of saìga, association, is clearly explained.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Çré Uddhava said: My dear Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, what type of person do You consider to be a true devotee, and what type of devotional service is approved by great devotees as worthy of being offered to Your Lordship? My dear ruler of the universal controllers, O Lord of Vaikuëöha and almighty God of the universe, I am Your devotee, and because I love You I have no other shelter than You. Therefore please explain this to me.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In the previous verse it was stated that one can achieve the Lord's supreme abode by associating with devotees. Therefore, Uddhava naturally inquires about the symptoms of a distinguished devotee whose association can promote one to the kingdom of God. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé notes that the Personality of Godhead knows who is actually a sincere devotee because the Lord is always attached to His loving servitors. Similarly, pure devotees can expertly explain the proper methods of devotional service to Lord Kåñëa because they are already absorbed in love of Kåñëa. Uddhava herein requests Lord Kåñëa to describe the qualities of a devotee and asks the Lord to explain the devotional service that the devotees themselves approve as worthy to be offered to the Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura remarks that the word puruñädhyakña indicates that Lord Kåñëa is the supreme ruler of the universal controllers headed by Mahä-Viñëu, and thus the Lord possesses infinite sovereignty. The term lokädhyakña indicates that Lord Kåñëa is the ultimate supervising authority of all of the Vaikuëöha planets, and therefore the Lord is unlimitedly glorious and perfect. Uddhava further addresses Lord Kåñëa as jagat-prabhu, because even in the illusory material world the Lord exhibits His unlimited mercy by personally incarnating to uplift the conditioned souls. The word praëatäya ("Your surrendered devotee") indicates that Uddhava is not proud like ordinary fools who do not enjoy bowing down to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, Uddhava mentions that he is anuraktäya, or completely bound in love to Lord Kåñëa, because unlike other great devotees such as Arjuna, who sometimes worshiped demigods in order to comply with social customs or to show respect for their positions in the scheme of planetary management, Uddhava never worshiped any demigods. Therefore, Uddhava is prapannäya, or completely surrendered to Lord Kåñëa, having no other shelter.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The pure devotees of the Lord propagate devotional service all over the world, and therefore, although separate from the personal form of the Lord, they are considered to be manifestations of God's mercy and potency. As stated in Caitanya-caritämåta (Antya 7.11): kåñëa-çakti vinä nahe tära pravartana.</div>
<div class="First"> The Lord is like the sky (vyoma) because although expanded everywhere, He is not entangled in anything. He is prakåteù paraù, or completely transcendental to material nature. The Lord is fully self-satisfied and is therefore indifferent to the affairs of the material world. Still, because of His causeless mercy, the Lord desires to expand pure devotional service, and for this reason He incarnates within the material world to uplift the fallen conditioned souls.</div>
<div class="First"> The Lord descends in selected spiritual bodies to please His loving devotees. Sometimes He appears in His original form as Kåñëa. And even Kåñëa Himself appears in different forms to special devotees so that they may fully develop their loving sentiments for Him. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé gives several examples of the Lord's special mercy upon His devotees. Lord Kåñëa personally went to the home of Jämbavän and there displayed a form with slightly angry glances. In that form, the Lord enjoyed a fight with His devotee. The Lord displayed His form as Dattätreya to Atri Muni and similarly bestowed special mercy upon Lord Brahmä, the demigods, Akrüra and innumerable other devotees. And in Våndävana the Lord displayed His most beautiful form as Govinda to the fortunate inhabitants.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted from the Prakäça-saàhitä as follows. "The Lord accepts different spiritual bodies according to the desire of His devotees. For example, the Lord agreed to become the son of Vasudeva and Devaké. Thus, although Lord Kåñëa has an eternal, blissful spiritual form, He appears to enter within the body of His devotee who becomes His mother. Although we speak of the Lord's 'taking on a body,' the Lord does not change His form, as do the conditioned souls, who must change their material bodies. The Lord appears in His own eternally unchangeable forms. Lord Hari always appears in the forms that are especially desired by His loving devotees, and never in other forms. However, if one thinks that the Lord, in the manner of an ordinary person taking birth, becomes the physical son of Vasudeva or other devotees, then one is victimized by illusion. The Lord merely expands His spiritual potency, causing His pure devotees to think, 'Kåñëa is now my son.' One should understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead never accepts or rejects a material body, nor does He ever give up His eternal spiritual forms; rather, the Lord eternally manifests His blissful bodies according to the loving sentiments of His eternal pure devotees."</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Jéva Gosvämé mentions that the word vyoma also indicates the Lord's name of Paravyoma, or the Lord of the spiritual sky. One should not misinterpret this verse to mean that Lord Kåñëa is impersonal, like the material sky, or that the form of Kåñëa is merely another selected incarnation equal to any other. Such casual and whimsical speculations cannot be accepted as actual spiritual knowledge. Çré Kåñëa is the original Personality of Godhead (kåñëas tu bhagavän svayam [SB 1.3.28]), and the Lord has explained elaborately in Bhagavad-gétä that He is the original source of everything. Therefore, the pure devotees of the Lord are eternally engaged, in full knowledge and bliss, in loving service to the Lord's original form as Kåñëa. The whole purpose of Çrémad-Bhägavatam is to arouse our love for Lord Kåñëa, and one should not foolishly misunderstand this great purpose.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: O Uddhava, a saintly person is merciful and never injures others. Even if others are aggressive he is tolerant and forgiving toward all living entities. His strength and meaning in life come from the truth itself, he is free from all envy and jealousy, and his mind is equal in material happiness and distress. Thus, he dedicates his time to work for the welfare of all others. His intelligence is never bewildered by material desires, and he has controlled his senses. His behavior is always pleasing, never harsh and always exemplary, and he is free from possessiveness. He never endeavors in ordinary, worldly activities, and he strictly controls his eating. He therefore always remains peaceful and steady. A saintly person is thoughtful and accepts Me as his only shelter. Such a person is very cautious in the execution of his duties and is never subject to superficial transformations, because he is steady and noble, even in a distressing situation. He has conquered over the six material qualities—namely hunger, thirst, lamentation, illusion, old age and death. He is free from all desire for prestige and offers honor to others. He is expert in reviving the Kåñëa consciousness of others and therefore never cheats anyone. Rather, he is a well-wishing friend to all, being most merciful. Such a saintly person must be considered the most learned of men. He perfectly understands that the ordinary religious duties prescribed by Me in various Vedic scriptures possess favorable qualities that purify the performer, and he knows that neglect of such duties constitutes a discrepancy in one's life. Having taken complete shelter at My lotus feet, however, a saintly person ultimately renounces such ordinary religious duties and worships Me alone. He is thus considered to be the best among all living entities.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Verses 29-31 describe twenty-eight qualities of a saintly person, and verse 32 explains the highest perfection of life. According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, the seventeenth quality (mat-çaraëa, or taking complete shelter of Lord Kåñëa) is the most important, and the other twenty-seven qualities automatically appear in one who has become a pure devotee of the Lord. As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (5.18.12), yasyästi bhaktir bhagavaty akiïcanä sarvair guëais tatra samäsate suräù. The twenty-eight saintly qualities may be described as follows.</div>
<div class="First"> (1) Kåpälu. A devotee cannot tolerate seeing the world merged in ignorance and suffering the whiplashes of mäyä. Therefore he busily engages in distributing Kåñëa consciousness and is called kåpälu, or merciful. (2) Akåta-droha. Even if someone is offensive toward a devotee, a devotee does not become offensive in return. Indeed, he never acts against the interest of any living entity. One may argue that great Vaiñëava kings, such as Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira and Parékñit Mahäräja, executed many criminals. However, when justice is properly administered by the state, sinful, destructive persons actually benefit from their punishment because they become freed from the severe karmic reactions to their illicit activities. A Vaiñëava ruler gives punishment not out of envy or malice, but in faithful obedience to the laws of God. The Mäyävädé philosophers who want to kill God by imagining that He does not exist are certainly kåta-droha, or most injurious to themselves and others. The impersonalist imagines that he himself is supreme and thus creates a most dangerous situation for himself and his followers. Similarly, the karmés, who are dedicated to material sense gratification, are also killers of the self, because by their absorption in material consciousness they lose all chance of experiencing the Absolute Truth and the truth of their own self. Therefore, all living entities who come under the control of materialistic regulations and duties are unnecessarily harassing themselves and others, and a pure Vaiñëava feels great compassion and concern for them. A devotee never uses his mind, body or words to perform any act harmful to the welfare of any living entity. (3) Titikñu. A devotee forgives and forgets any offense against himself. A Vaiñëava is personally detached from his material body, which is made of pus, stool, blood, and so on. Therefore the devotee is able to overlook the obnoxious behavior he sometimes meets with in the course of preaching work and always deals with people as a perfect gentleman. A Vaiñëava loudly chants the holy name of the Lord and tolerates and forgives those fallen conditioned souls who are unable to reciprocate properly with a pure devotee. (4) Satya-sära. A devotee always remembers that he is the eternal servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is omniscient, the reservoir of all pleasure and the ultimate enjoyer of all activities. By avoiding activities outside devotional service, a devotee remains fixed in the truth, does not uselessly waste time and thus becomes bold, powerful and steady. (5) Anavadyätmä. A devotee knows that the material world is a temporary phantasmagoria and therefore does not envy anyone in any material situation. He never tries to agitate others or criticize them unnecessarily. (6) Sama. A devotee remains steady and equal in material happiness or distress, fame or infamy. His actual wealth is his consciousness of Kåñëa, and he understands that his real self-interest lies outside the scope of material nature. He does not become excited or depressed by external events, but remains fixed in consciousness of the omnipotency of Lord Kåñëa. (7) Sarvopakäraka. Neglecting one's selfish desires and working for the satisfaction of others is called paropakära, whereas causing trouble to others for one's personal gratification is called paräpakära. A devotee always works for the pleasure of Lord Kåñëa, who is the resting place of all living entities, and thus a devotee's activities are ultimately pleasing to everyone. Devotional service to Lord Kåñëa is the perfectional stage of welfare work, since Lord Kåñëa is the supreme controller of everyone's happiness and distress. Foolish persons under the influence of false egotism, considering themselves to be the ultimate well-wishers of others, execute superficial materialistic activities rather than attending to the eternal happiness of others. Because a devotee remains pure and engages in missionary activities, he is everyone's best friend. (8) Kämair ahata-dhé. Ordinary persons see all material things as objects for their personal gratification and thus try to acquire or control them. Ultimately a man wants to possess a woman and enjoy sex gratification with her. The Supreme Lord supplies the desired fuel that causes the fire of lust to burn painfully in one's heart, but the Lord does not give self-realization to such a misguided person. Lord Kåñëa is transcendental and neutral, but if one is eager to exploit the Lord's creation, the Lord gives one facility through mäyä, and one becomes cheated of real happiness by entangling himself in the false role of a great and lusty enjoyer of the world. On the other hand, one who has taken full shelter of Kåñëa is enriched with perfect knowledge and bliss and is not cheated by the seductive appearances of the material world. A pure devotee does not follow the path of the foolish deer, which is seduced by the hunter's horn and killed. A devotee is never attracted by the sensuous entreaties of a beautiful woman, and he avoids hearing from bewildered karmés about the so-called glories of material acquisition. Similarly, a pure devotee is not bewildered by aroma or taste. He does not become attached to sumptuous eating, nor does he spend the whole day making arrangements for bodily comfort. The only actual enjoyer of God's creation is the Lord Himself, and the living entities are secondary enjoyers who experience unlimited pleasure through the Lord's pleasure. This perfect process of experiencing pleasure is called bhakti-yoga, or pure devotional service, and a devotee never sacrifices his auspicious position of steady intelligence, even in the face of so-called material opportunity.</div>
<div class="First"> (9) Dänta. A devotee is naturally repelled by sinful activities and controls his senses by dedicating all his acts to Kåñëa. This requires steady concentration and a cautious mentality.</div>
<div class="First"> (lo) Mådu. A materialistic person will always see people as friends or enemies and thus will sometimes justify cruel or small-minded behavior in order to subdue his opponents. Since a devotee has taken shelter of Lord Kåñëa, he does not consider anyone his enemy and is never disturbed by the tendency to desire or enjoy the suffering of others. Thus he is mådu, or gentle and sublime.</div>
<div class="First"> (11) Çuci. A devotee never touches that which is impure or improper, and simply by remembering such a pure devotee, one is freed from the tendency to sin. Because of his perfect behavior, a devotee is called çuci, or pure. (12) Akiïcana. A devotee is free from possessiveness and is not eager to enjoy or renounce anything, since he considers everything to be Lord Kåñëa's property.</div>
<div class="First"> (13) Anéha. A devotee never acts on his own behalf, but rather for the service of Lord Kåñëa. He is therefore aloof from ordinary, worldly affairs. (14) Mita-bhuk. A devotee accepts material sense objects only as far as necessary, to keep himself healthy and fit in Lord Kåñëa's service. He is therefore not entangled by his sense activities and never injures his self-realization. When necessary, a devotee can give up anything for Lord Kåñëa's service, but he does not accept or reject anything for his personal prestige.</div>
<div class="First"> (15) Çänta. Those trying to exploit the Lord's creation are always disturbed. A devotee, however, is detached from such pointless activities and understands sense gratification to be diametrically opposed to his self-interest. Being always engaged according to the Lord's desire, he remains peaceful. (16) Sthira. Remembering that Lord Kåñëa is the basis of everything, a devotee does not become fearful or impatient.</div>
<div class="First"> (17) Mat-çaraëa. A devotee does not take pleasure in anything except serving Lord Kåñëa and is constantly attentive in the execution of his duties. A devotee knows that only Lord Kåñëa can protect him and engage him in useful work.</div>
<div class="First"> (18) Muni. A devotee is thoughtful and through intelligent contemplation avoids becoming distracted from his spiritual advancement. By intelligence he is freed from doubts about Lord Kåñëa and confronts all problems in life with steady Kåñëa consciousness.</div>
<div class="First"> (19) Apramatta. One who forgets the Supreme Lord is more or less crazy, but a devotee remains sane by offering his activities to Lord Kåñëa. (20) Gabhérätmä. As a devotee merges into the ocean of Kåñëa consciousness, his own consciousness becomes deeper and deeper; ordinary, superficial persons hovering on the material platform cannot fathom the extent of a devotee's awareness.</div>
<div class="First"> (21) Dhåtimän. By controlling the urges of the tongue and genitals the devotee remains steady and patient and does not impulsively change his position.</div>
<div class="First"> (22) Jita-ñaò-guëa. By spiritual knowledge, a devotee is able to conquer the pushings of hunger, thirst, lamentation, illusion, old age and death. (23) Amäné. A devotee is not puffed up, and even if he is famous, he does not take such fame very seriously.</div>
<div class="First"> (24) Mäna-da. A devotee offers all respects to others, since everyone is part and parcel of Lord Kåñëa.</div>
<div class="First"> (25) Kalya. A devotee is expert in making people understand the truth of Kåñëa consciousness.</div>
<div class="First"> (26) Maitra. A devotee does not cheat anyone by encouraging them in the bodily concept of life; rather, by his missionary work a devotee is the true friend of everyone.</div>
<div class="First"> (27) Käruëika. A devotee tries to make people sane and thus is most merciful. He is para-duùkha-duùkhé, or one who is unhappy to see the unhappiness of others.</div>
<div class="First"> (28) Kavi. A devotee is expert in studying the transcendental qualities of Lord Kåñëa and is able to show the harmony and compatibility of the Lord's apparently contradictory qualities. This is possible through expert knowledge of the absolute nature of the Lord. Lord Caitanya is softer than a rose and harder than a thunderbolt, but these opposing qualities can easily be understood in terms of the Lord's transcendental nature and purpose. One who is always able to understand the truth of Kåñëa consciousness, without opposition or confusion, is called kavi, or most learned. The position of those on the spiritual path can be understood in terms of their development of the qualities mentioned above. Ultimately, the most important quality is to take shelter of Lord Kåñëa, since the Lord can award all good qualities to His sincere devotee. In the lowest stage of devotional service one acts with a desire to enjoy sense gratification but at the same time tries to offer the fruits to the Lord. This stage is called karma-miçrä bhakti. As one gradually purifies himself in devotional service, he becomes detached through knowledge and gains relief from anxiety. In this stage he becomes attached to transcendental knowledge, and therefore this stage is called jïäna-miçrä bhakti, or devotional service to Lord Kåñëa with a desire to enjoy the fruits of transcendental knowledge. But because pure love for Kåñëa is actually the greatest happiness and the natural position of the living entity, a sincere devotee gradually overcomes his desire to enjoy sense gratification and knowledge and comes to the stage of pure devotional service, which is devoid of personal desire. Na karmäëi tyajed yogé karmabhis tyajyate hi saù: "The yogé should not give up his work, but rather should cultivate detachment by which his material activities will automatically vanish." In other words, one should continue to perform one's prescribed duties, even imperfectly. If one is sincere about advancing in Kåñëa consciousness, then by the strength of bhakti-yoga his activities will gradually be transformed into pure loving service. There are innumerable examples of fruitive workers, mental speculators and materialistic devotees who became perfect by the strength of devotional service. By rendering loving service to Kåñëa, one automatically experiences the greatest pleasure of life and is endowed with perfect knowledge. There is nothing lacking in the process of pure devotional service, and there is no need for any extraneous endeavor to acquire sense pleasure or philosophical satisfaction. One must be completely convinced that simply by serving Kåñëa one will get all perfection in life. Even if one lacks some or all of the above-mentioned qualities, one should sincerely engage in Lord Kåñëa's service, and gradually one's character will become perfect. One who is a sincere devotee of Lord Kåñëa will develop all godly qualities by the mercy of the Lord, and one who is already serving the Lord with the above-mentioned qualities is to be understood as the greatest devotee. As indicated in verse 32, a pure devotee of the Lord is fully aware of the pious advantages of executing duties within the varëäçrama system, and he is similarly aware of the harmful mistake of neglecting such duties. Still, having full faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a devotee gives up all ordinary social and religious activities and engages fully in devotional service. He knows that Lord Kåñëa is the ultimate source of everything and that all perfection comes from Lord Kåñëa alone. Because of his extraordinary faith, the devotee is called sattama, or the best among all living beings.</div>
<div class="First"> As explained by Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé in Upadeçämåta, a devotee who has not yet developed the good qualities mentioned above but is nevertheless sincerely endeavoring for Kåñëa consciousness should receive the mercy of superior Vaiñëavas. One should not necessarily accept intimate association with such an aspirant to pure devotional service, but one should be confident that by chanting the holy names of Kåñëa such a person will eventually attain all perfection. One can imagine the beauty of a society filled with saintly persons, as described in these verses. The wonderful Kåñëa conscious qualities mentioned above are the basis of a peaceful and prosperous society, and if everyone takes to the loving service of Lord Kåñëa, then certainly the present atmosphere of fear, violence, lust, greed and insanity can be replaced by a celestial situation in which all leaders and citizens will be happy. The essential points here are mat-çaraëa ("one should take full shelter of Lord Kåñëa") and mäà bhajeta ("one should worship the Lord through the authorized process"). In this way the entire world can become sattama, or most perfect.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, although yävän indicates that Lord Kåñëa cannot be limited by time or space, He becomes limited by the love of His pure devotees. For example, Lord Kåñëa never steps one foot out of Våndävana, because of the intense love of its inhabitants for Him. In this way, the Lord comes under the control of His devotees' love. The word yaù indicates that Kåñëa is the Absolute Truth who appears as the son of Vasudeva, or as Çyämasundara. Yädåça indicates that the Lord is ätmäräma, or completely self-satisfied, and also äpta-käma, or "one who automatically fulfills all of His desires." Still, being affected by the love of His devotees, the Lord sometimes appears to be anätmäräma, or dependent on the love of His devotees, and anäptakäma, unable to achieve His desire without the cooperation of His devotees. Actually, the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, is always independent, but He reciprocates the intense love of His devotees and thus appears to be dependent on them, just as He apparently became dependent on Nanda Mahäräja and Yaçodä during His childhood pastimes in Våndävana. The word ajïätvä ("inexperienced, lacking knowledge") indicates that sometimes a devotee may not have a proper philosophical understanding of the Personality of Godhead or due to love may temporarily forget the Lord's</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">position. In Bhagavad-gétä (11.41) Arjuna says,</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sakheti matvä prasabhaà yad uktaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">he kåñëa he yädava he sakheti</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ajänatä mahimänaà tavedaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mayä pramädät praëayena väpi</div>
<div class="First"> "I have in the past addressed You as 'O Kåñëa,' 'O Yädava,' 'O my friend,' without knowing Your glories. Please forgive whatever I may have done in madness or in love." Arjuna's words ajänatä mahimänam have the same meaning as Kåñëa's words ajïätvä mäm in this verse of the Bhägavatam. Both indicate incomplete understanding of Kåñëa's glories. In Bhagavad-gétä Arjuna says, praëayena: his forgetfulness of Kåñëa's supreme position was caused by his love for Him. In this verse, Kåñëa excuses such lapses on the part of His devotees with the words ajïätvä mäm, which indicate that even though devotees may not fully appreciate His exalted position, Kåñëa accepts their loving service. Thus this verse clearly reveals the supreme position of bhakti. Lord Kåñëa also states in Bhagavad-gétä (11.54):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhaktyä tv ananyayä çakya</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">aham evaà-vidho 'rjuna</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">jïätum drañöuà ca tattvena</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">praveñöuà ca parantapa</div>
<div class="First"> "My dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I am, standing before you, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of My understanding."</div>
<div class="First"> Although one may develop innumerable saintly qualities, without love of Kåñëa one will not achieve complete success. One must understand the Personality of Godhead as He is and love Him. Even if one is not capable of analytically understanding the position of God, if one simply loves Kåñëa, then one is certainly perfect. Many of the residents of Våndävana had no idea that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, nor did they know of Kåñëa's potencies or incarnations. They simply loved Kåñëa with their hearts and souls, and therefore they are considered most perfect.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> My dear Uddhava, one can give up false pride and prestige by engaging in the following devotional activities. One may purify oneself by seeing, touching, worshiping, serving, and offering prayers of glorification and obeisances to My form as the Deity and to My pure devotees. One should also glorify My transcendental qualities and activities, hear with love and faith the narrations of My glories and constantly meditate on Me. One should offer to Me whatever one acquires, and accepting oneself as My eternal servant, one should give oneself completely to Me. One should always discuss My birth and activities and enjoy life by participating in festivals, such as Janmäñöamé, which glorify My pastimes. In My temple, one should also participate in festivals and ceremonies by singing, dancing, playing musical instruments and discussing Me with other Vaiñëavas. One should observe all the regularly celebrated annual festivals by attending ceremonies, pilgrimages and making offerings. One should also observe religious vows such as Ekädaçé and take initiation by the procedures mentioned in the Vedas, Païcarätra and other, similar literatures. One should faithfully and lovingly support the installation of My Deity, and individually or in cooperation with others one should work for the construction of Kåñëa conscious temples and cities as well as flower gardens, fruit gardens and special areas to celebrate My pastimes. One should consider oneself to be My humble servant, without duplicity, and thus should help to clean the temple, which is My home. First one should sweep and dust thoroughly, and then one should further cleanse with water and cow dung. Having dried the temple, one should sprinkle scented water and decorate the temple with mandalas. One should thus act just like My servant. A devotee should never advertise his devotional activities; therefore his service will not be the cause of false pride. One should never use lamps that are offered to Me for other purposes simply because there is need of illumination, and similarly, one should never offer to Me anything that has been offered to or used by others. Whatever is most desired by one within this material world, and whatever is most dear to oneself—one should offer that very thing to Me. Such an offering qualifies one for eternal life.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In these eight verses Lord Kåñëa ends His discussion of saintly qualities in general and describes the specific characteristics of the devotees of the Lord. Lord Kåñëa has clearly described both here and in Bhagavad-gétä that the ultimate goal of life is to surrender fully to Him and become His pure devotee. Herein the Lord elaborately describes the process of devotional service. One should offer everything that one acquires to the Lord, thinking, "Lord Kåñëa has sent these things so that I may serve Him nicely." One ultimately should understand that the minute spirit soul is part and parcel of Lord Kåñëa, and thus one should surrender one's very self to the Lord. Just as an ordinary servant is meek and submissive to his master, similarly, a devotee should always be submissive to his spiritual master, who is a representative of Lord Kåñëa. He should realize how his body and mind are purified simply by his seeing the spiritual master or by accepting on his head the water offered to the spiritual master. It is emphasized in these verses that one should attend Vaiñëava festivals. As far as possible, large festivals should be held all over the world so that people can gradually learn how to perfect human life. The words mamärcä-sthäpane çraddhä are significant. Here Lord Kåñëa states that one should have faith in His Deity worship, since the Lord is personally present as the Deity. The words udyänopavanäkréòa-pura-mandira-karmaëi indicate that there should be a serious endeavor to construct beautiful temples and Vaiñëava cities with ample parks, orchards and flower gardens. An outstanding example of such endeavors can be presently seen in India at the Mäyäpur Candrodaya Mandira.</div>
<div class="First"> The words dépävalokaà me nopayuïjyän niveditam indicate that one may never use the Deity's paraphernalia for sense gratification. If there is a shortage of electricity or lights, one may not use the Deity's lamps, nor should one ever offer to Lord Kåñëa paraphernalia previously offered to or used by others. In these verses, the importance of Deity worship and Vaiñëava festivals is emphasized in many ways. Lord Kåñëa promises that whoever sincerely performs these activities will certainly go back home, back to Godhead (tad änantyäya kalpate). One should offer his most dear possession to Lord Kåñëa, not that which is superfluous or unwanted. If one is most attached to his family, one should see that his family is engaged in Lord Kåñëa's service. If one is most attached to money, that should be given for propagating Kåñëa consciousness. And if one considers one's intelligence to be most valuable, he should preach Kåñëa consciousness with great logic and reason. If we offer our most valuable possessions to Lord Kåñëa, we will automatically become dear to the Lord and go back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="First"> Unless one understands that Lord Kåñëa is all-pervading and that everything is resting within the Lord, one's Kåñëa consciousness is third class and materialistic. It is clearly stated in all Vedic literatures that the Supreme Absolute Truth is the source of everything. Everything is within Him, and He is within everything. To avoid a materialistic conception of Lord Kåñëa, one should not think that the Lord exists only in a particular time and place. Rather, one should understand that He exists at all times and in all places and that one may search for and find Lord Kåñëa within all things. The word püjä-padäni indicates that Lord Kåñëa is all-pervading, but this does not mean that all things are Lord Kåñëa. Lord Kåñëa speaks this verse to clarify His supremacy as the all-pervading Personality of Godhead and to show the path of complete self-realization.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Significantly, the Lord emphasizes in these three verses that one should worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is expanded within all living beings. It is not recommended that one accept any material or spiritual object other than the Lord as supreme. By maintaining steady consciousness of the Lord in His all-pervading feature, one can remain in a worshipful mood twenty-four hours a day. Thus, one will naturally try to engage all material and spiritual elements in the loving service of Lord Kåñëa. If because of ignorance one forgets the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one may become inclined to worship powerful material phenomena independent of the Supreme Lord, or one may foolishly consider oneself to be supreme. One should remain sane and accept the worshipable presence of the Supreme Lord within everything.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The Lord has previously explained that He appears in different transcendental forms to His pure devotees so that they may unlimitedly increase their love of Godhead. Here is given a general description of the four-armed Näräyaëa form, which pervades the material world as Supersoul, or Paramätmä. The pure devotees, however, do not meditate upon the Lord within the heart but rather render active service to a specific form of the Lord, such as Räma or Kåñëa, and thus perfect their realization of Bhagavän, or the Supreme Lord, who engages in transcendental pastimes with His devotees in the spiritual world. Yet even within the material world one can spiritualize one's existence by seeing the Supreme Lord within everything and worshiping Him by constant meditation. As mentioned in the previous verses, one should also go to the temple and specifically worship the Deity and participate in spiritual festivals. One should not be puffed up and claim that because one is meditating on the Lord within nature there is no need to go to the temple. Temple worship has been repeatedly emphasized by the Lord Himself. The word samähita in this verse indicates samädhi. If one very carefully worships the Deity or hears and chants about the pastimes of Lord Kåñëa, one is certainly in samädhi. By worshiping and glorifying the Lord twenty-four hours a day one becomes a liberated soul and gradually rises completely beyond the influence of the material creation. The living entity is called ätmä, or eternal soul, because of his relationship with the Paramätmä, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By worshiping the Lord, our eternal nature revives, and as we increase our enthusiasm and steadiness in devotional service, material existence fades away.</div>

<div class="First"> The word iñöä-pürtena, which means "sacrificial performances and pious works," does not indicate deviation from the pure devotional service of the Lord. Lord Kåñëa, or Viñëu, is called Yajïa, or the Lord of sacrifice, and in Bhagavad-gétä (5.29) Lord Kåñëa says, bhoktäraà yajïa-tapasäm: "I am the actual enjoyer of all sacrifice." The highest sacrifice is to chant the holy names of the Lord, and by taking shelter of the Lord's names, one will acquire unflinching devotion and realized knowledge of the Absolute Truth. A realized devotee is very attentive in his devotional service, taking it as his life and soul. He keeps himself fit for devotional service by constantly worshiping and glorifying the lotus feet of the spiritual master and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such hari-näma-kértana and guru-püjä are the only practical methods by which one can achieve pure devotional service. When hari-kértana is expanded, it is called kåñëa-saìkértana. One should not dry up by performing unauthorized austerities or sacrifices; rather, one should engage with all enthusiasm in the great sacrifice of çré-kåñëa-saìkértana, which enables one to easily achieve the highest perfection of human life.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear Uddhava, I am personally the ultimate shelter and way of life for saintly liberated persons, and thus if one does not engage in My loving devotional service, which is made possible by associating with My devotees, then for all practical purposes, one possesses no effective means for escaping from material existence.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa has described to Uddhava the characteristics of jïäna-yoga and bhakti-yoga, both of which are considered to be spiritual processes. Now, however, Lord Kåñëa clearly indicates that bhakti-yoga is the only real means to totally free oneself from material existence, and that bhakti-yoga is not possible without sat-saìga, or association with other Vaiñëavas. On the path of bhakti-miçra jïäna, or speculation on the Absolute Truth mixed with devotion, one is still affected by the three modes of material nature. The pure soul, liberated from all material qualities, has no tendency or desire to engage in philosophical speculation, severe austerities or impersonal meditation. The pure soul simply loves Kåñëa and wants to serve Him constantly. Jévera 'svarüpa' haya-kåñëera 'nitya-däsa.' [Cc. Madhya 20.108]. Pure devotional service to the Lord is called kevala-bhakti, whereas devotional service mixed with speculative propensities is called guëa-bhüta-bhakti, or devotional service polluted by the material modes of nature. One who is actually intelligent does not make a show of philosophical wizardry but rather discerns the superiority of pure love of Godhead and takes to the path of kevala-bhakti. One who emphasizes so-called intellectual achievements is actually less intelligent, because such a person is more attracted to intelligence than to the pure soul, which is superior. It should be understood, however, that pure devotional service is not nonphilosophical or anti-intellectual. The Absolute Truth is far more extensive than partial truth. Therefore, one who is in full knowledge of Lord Kåñëa has the greatest facility to engage in philosophical analysis, since a pure devotee is working with the entire range of conceptual categories. Those who do not know Lord Kåñëa are attracted to the impersonal Brahman or the localized Paramätmä, but they are not aware of the ultimate category of understanding called Bhagavän, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lacking knowledge of Bhagavän, such imperfect philosophers certainly do not understand the expansion, interaction and withdrawal of the Lord's innumerable potencies and thus cannot fully analyze them. By faithfully accepting everything Lord Kåñëa speaks as the absolute truth, one comes to the mature platform of philosophy and achieves perfect knowledge. In addition to philosophical or intellectual understanding, pure devotional service also awards all other benefits in life, both material and spiritual; therefore one who for any purpose whatsoever accepts a process other than devotional service has unfortunately misunderstood the nature of pure devotional service to Lord Kåñëa. It is emphasized here that one must cultivate devotional service in the association of other devotees. On the other hand, the jïäna-yoga process is cultivated alone, because it is difficult for even two mental speculators to be in the same place without their association degenerating into constant quarrel. Other processes of self-realization are compared to the nipples on a goat's neck. They look just like breast nipples, but they will not give any milk whatsoever. In this regard Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has quoted the following verses, spoken by Çré Uddhava, Çukadeva Gosvämé and Närada Muni respectively.</div>

<div class="First"> If, as stated in this verse, it is generally (präyeëa) impossible to escape material bondage without devotional service in the association of devotees, one can simply imagine the probabilities of liberation in Kali-yuga without the Kåñëa consciousness movement. The chances are certainly zero. One may concoct a type of liberation on the mental platform, or one may live in a so-called spiritual society of mutual flattery, but if one actually wants to go back home, back to Godhead, and see with spiritual eyes the beautiful kingdom of God called Kåñëaloka, one must take to Lord Caitanya's movement and worship Lord Kåñëa in the association of the bhakta-gaëa, the devotees of the Lord.</div>

<div class="First"> It is stated in the First Chapter of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.1.8), brüyuù snigdhasya çiñyasya guravo guhyam apy uta: a bona fide spiritual master naturally reveals all transcendental secrets to a sincere disciple. Çré Uddhava had completely surrendered to Lord Kåñëa, and then only could the Lord explain such mysteries to him, because without complete faith the transmission of spiritual knowledge is impossible. Other processes of self realization, such as philosophical speculation, are imperfect and unsteady because the performer has personal desires, and there is no definite procedure by which to obtain the full mercy of the Supreme Lord. On the other hand, association with the pure devotees of the Lord is a self-sufficient process that is guaranteed to award the desired result. One must only learn how to associate with the pure devotees and one's life will be perfect. That is the sum and substance of this chapter.</div>
<div class="First"> Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Eleventh Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Symptoms of Conditioned and Liberated Living Entities."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 12. Beyond Renunciation and Knowledge</div>
<div class="First"> In this chapter the glories of holy association and the superexcellence of the pure love of the residents of Våndävana are described. The association of saintly devotees destroys the soul's attachment to material life and is capable of bringing even the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, under one's control. Neither yoga, Säìkhya philosophy, ordinary religious duties, study of scriptures, austerities, renunciation, works of iñöä and pürtam, charity, vows of fasting, worship of the Deity, secret mantras, visiting of holy places, nor adherence to any major or minor regulative principles can effect the same result. In every age there are demons, monsters, birds and animals who are in the modes of passion and ignorance, and there are also human beings in the categories of businessmen, women, workers, outcastes, and so on, who cannot study the Vedic scriptures. Nevertheless, by the purifying effect of the association of devotees they may all achieve the supreme abode of the Personality of Godhead, whereas without such saintly association, even those very seriously endeavoring in yoga, Säìkhya study, charity, vows and practice of the renounced order of life may remain incapable of attaining the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="First"> The young damsels of Vraja, ignorant of the true identity of Lord Kåñëacandra, considered Him to be their paramour who would give them pleasure. Yet by the power of their constant association with Çré Kåñëa, they attained to the supreme Absolute Truth, which even great demigods like Brahmä cannot achieve. The young women of Våndävana displayed such deep attachment to Lord Kåñëa that their minds, which were overflowing with the ecstasy of being with Him, perceived an entire night spent in His company as just a fraction of a second. However, when Akrüra took Çré Kåñëa along with Baladeva to Mathurä, the gopés then thought each night without Him to be equal in duration to a millennium of the demigods. Being tormented by separation from Lord Kåñëa, they could not imagine anything that could give them satisfaction other than His return. This is the incomparable excellence of the gopés' pure love of God.</div>
<div class="First"> The Supreme Lord, Çré Kåñëa, after imparting these instructions to Uddhava, advised that for the sake of attaining the Absolute Truth, Uddhava should give up all consideration of religion and irreligion as promulgated in the çrutis and småtis and instead take shelter of the example of the women of Våndävana.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Uddhava, by associating with My pure devotees one can destroy one's attachment for all objects of material sense gratification. Such purifying association brings Me under the control of My devotee. One may perform the añöäìga-yoga system, engage in philosophical analysis of the elements of material nature, practice nonviolence and other ordinary principles of piety, chant the Vedas, perform penances, take to the renounced order of life, execute sacrificial performances and dig wells, plant trees and perform other public welfare activities, give in charity, carry out severe vows, worship the demigods, chant confidential mantras, visit holy places or accept major and minor disciplinary injunctions, but even by performing such activities one does not bring Me under his control.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The commentary of Çréla Jéva Gosvämé on these two verses can be summarized as follows. One may serve the devotees of the Lord through ceremonial worship or by actually associating with them. Association with pure devotees is sufficient for self-realization because one can learn everything about spiritual advancement from such devotees. With perfect knowledge one can achieve all that one desires, for the process of devotional service immediately brings the blessings of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Pure devotional service is transcendental to the modes of nature, and therefore it appears mysterious to the souls conditioned by those modes. In the previous chapter Lord Kåñëa stated, haviñägnau yajeta mäm: "One may worship Me in fire by offering oblations of ghee." (SB 11.11.43) Also, in verse 38 of the previous chapter it was mentioned that one should construct parks, recreational places, orchards, vegetable gardens, and so on. These serve to attract people to the temples of Kåñëa, where they may directly engage in chanting the holy name of the Lord. Such construction projects may be understood as pürtam, or public welfare activities. Although Lord Kåñëa mentions in these two verses that association with His pure devotees is far more powerful than processes such as yoga, philosophical speculation, sacrifices and public welfare activities, these secondary activities also please Lord Kåñëa, but to a lesser extent. Specifically, they please the Lord when performed by devotees rather than by ordinary materialistic persons. Therefore the comparative term yathä ("according to proportion") is used. In other words, such practices as sacrifice, austerity and philosophical study may help one become fit for rendering devotional service, and when such activities are performed by devotees aspiring for spiritual advancement, they become somewhat pleasing to the Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> One may study the example of vratäni, or vows. The injunction that one should fast on Ekädaçé is a permanent vow for all Vaiñëavas, and one should not conclude from these verses that one may neglect the Ekädaçé vow. The superiority of sat-saìga, or association with pure devotees, in awarding the fruit of love of Godhead does not mean that one should give up other processes or that these secondary processes are not permanent factors in bhakti-yoga. There are many Vedic injunctions instructing one to execute the agnihotra sacrifice, and the modern-day followers of Caitanya Mahäprabhu also occasionally execute fire sacrifices. Such sacrifice is recommended by the Lord Himself in the previous chapter, and therefore it should not be given up by the devotees of the Lord. By performing Vedic ritualistic and purificatory processes, one is gradually elevated to the platform of devotional service, whereupon one is able to directly worship the Absolute Truth. One Vedic injunction states, "The result awarded for fasting continuously for one month on six different occasions can easily be achieved simply by accepting a handful of rice offered to Lord Viñëu. This facility is especially offered in the Kali-yuga." Nevertheless, regulated fasting on Ekädaçé is not an impediment to spiritual advancement. Rather, it is a perpetual aspect of devotional service and can be considered an auxiliary principle supporting the main principle of worshiping Lord Kåñëa and His devotees. Because such secondary principles help one become fit for executing the primary processes of devotional service, they are also greatly beneficial. Therefore, such secondary principles are widely mentioned throughout Vedic literature. It may be concluded that such secondary principles are essential for advancement in Kåñëa consciousness, and therefore one should never give up the principle of vrata, the execution of prescribed vows.</div>
<div class="First"> In the previous chapter Çréla Çrédhara Svämé mentioned that the words äjïäyaivaà guëän doñän (SB 11.11.32) indicate that a devotee should select Vedic principles that do not conflict with his service to the Lord. Many of the elaborate Vedic ceremonies and complicated procedures for fasting, demigod worship and yoga practice cause great disturbance to the supreme process of çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù [SB 7.5.23], hearing and chanting about the Lord; therefore they are rejected by the Vaiñëavas. However, the processes helpful to devotional service should be accepted. The example can be given of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, who was instructed by the dying Bhéñmadeva. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.9.27) Bhéñma instructs King Yudhiñöhira in däna-dharma, or public acts of charity, räja-dharma, or the duties of a king, mokña-dharma, or duties for salvation, stré-dharma, or duties for women, and ultimately bhägavata-dharma, or pure devotional service to the Lord. Bhéñma did not limit his discussion to bhägavata-dharma, because Lord Kåñëa gave Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira the devotional service of acting as a king, and to execute his service Yudhiñöhira Mahäräja required extensive knowledge of civic affairs. However, one who is not rendering such prescribed devotional service in society should not unnecessarily involve himself in the material world, even by practice of Vedic rituals. Nothing should distract him from the ultimate goal of satisfying Lord Kåñëa.</div>
<div class="First"> The principle of not giving up prescribed vows may be further illustrated by the example of Mahäräja Ambaréña. In the Ninth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam we find that although Mahäräja Ambaréña performed elaborate Vedic sacrifices, his goal was always the satisfaction of the Lord. The citizens in his kingdom did not desire to go to heaven, because they were always hearing about the glories of Vaikuëöha. Ambaréña Mahäräja, along with his queen, observed the vow of Ekädaçé and Dvädaçé for one year. Since Ambaréña Mahäräja is considered to be a great jewel among Vaiñëavas, and since his behavior was always exemplary, it is definitely concluded that such vows as fasting on Ekädaçé are imperative for Vaiñëavas. It is further stated in Vedic literature, "If due to negligence a Vaiñëava does not fast on Ekädaçé, then his worship of Lord Viñëu is useless, and he will go to hell." The members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness fast from grains and beans on Ekädaçé, and this vow should always be observed by all of its members. If one falsely thinks that one may obtain the association of Lord Kåñëa merely by great austerities, brilliant studies in Sanskrit literature, magnanimous acts of charity, etc., one's Kåñëa consciousness will be distorted and weakened. One should remember the example of Lord Caitanya, who practiced Kåñëa consciousness by constantly hearing and chanting about Lord Kåñëa. If by fasting, study, austerity or sacrifice one becomes more fit to participate in the saìkértana movement of Lord Caitanya, then such activities are also pleasing to Lord Kåñëa. But the Lord clearly explains here that such activities can never become central in the practice of bhakti-yoga. They must remain in an auxiliary relationship to the supreme process of sat-saìga, or association with pure devotees who hear and chant the glories of the Lord. Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted from Vedic literature that if one offends the Lord's devotees and does not learn to associate with them, Lord Viñëu personally places barriers in the path of such a person so that he may not enter into the Lord's company.</div>

<div class="Translation"> In every yuga many living entities entangled in the modes of passion and ignorance gained the association of My devotees. Thus, such living entities as the Daityas, Räkñasas, birds, beasts, Gandharvas, Apsaräs, Nägas, Siddhas, Cäraëas, Guhyakas and Vidyädharas, as well as such lower-class human beings as the vaiçyas, çüdras, women and others, were able to achieve My supreme abode. Våträsura, Prahläda Mahäräja and others like them also achieved My abode by association with My devotees, as did personalities such as Våñaparvä, Bali Mahäräja, Bäëäsura, Maya, Vibhéñaëa, Sugréva, Hanumän, Jämbavän, Gajendra, Jaöäyu, Tulädhära, Dharma-vyädha, Kubjä, the gopés in Våndävana and the wives of the brähmaëas who were performing sacrifice.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The Lord has mentioned devotees such as the gopés in Våndävana and also demons like Bäëäsura to illustrate how He comes under the control of those who surrender to Him. It is understood that devotees like the gopés and others mentioned here obtained pure love of Kåñëa, whereas the demons generally obtained only salvation. Many demons were purified by association with devotees and came to accept devotional service to the Lord as the most important among the various activities in their lives, but the exalted devotees like Prahläda and Bali Mahäräja know nothing except devotional service, which they accept as their very life. Still, the reformed demons are also mentioned so that readers of Çrémad-Bhägavatam will understand the enormous benefits one may achieve by associating with devotees of the Lord. The demon Våträsura was the pious King Citraketu in his previous life, during which he associated with Çré Närada Muni, Çré Aìgirä Muni and Lord Saìkarñaëa. Prahläda Mahäräja, being the son of Hiraëyakaçipu, is considered a Daitya, or demon. Yet while still in the womb of his mother, Kayädhü, he associated with Närada Muni by sound vibration. The demon Våñaparvä was abandoned by his mother at birth, but he was raised by a muni and became a devotee of Lord Viñëu. Bali Mahäräja associated with his grandfather Prahläda and also with Lord Vämanadeva. Bali Mahäräja's son, Bäëäsura, was saved by association with his father and Lord Çiva. He also associated with Lord Kåñëa personally when the Lord cut off all but two of his one thousand arms, which had been awarded as a benediction by Lord Çiva. Understanding the glories of Lord Kåñëa, Bäëäsura also became a great devotee. The demon Maya Dänava constructed an assembly house for the Päëòavas and also associated with Lord Kåñëa Himself, eventually achieving the shelter of the Lord. Vibhéñaëa was a pious-natured demon, the brother of Rävaëa, and he associated with Hanumän and Rämacandra.</div>
<div class="First"> Sugréva, Hanumän, Jämbavän and Gajendra are examples of animals who achieved the mercy of the Lord. Jämbavän, or Åkñaräja, was a member of a race of monkeys. He personally associated with Lord Kåñëa, fighting with Him over the Syamantaka jewel. The elephant Gajendra in a previous life had association with devotees, and at the end of his life as Gajendra he was personally saved by the Lord. Jaöäyu, the bird who at the cost of his own life assisted Lord Rämacandra, associated with Çré Garuòa and Mahäräja Daçaratha as well as other devotees in räma-lélä. He also personally met with Sétä and Lord Räma. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the association that the Gandharvas, Apsaräs, Nägas, Siddhas, Cäraëas, Guhyakas and Vidyädharas had with the devotees is not very prominent and does not need to be mentioned. Vaëikpatha is a vaiçya, and his story is mentioned in the Mahäbhärata in connection with the pride of Jäjali Muni. The importance of association with devotees is illustrated in the story of Dharma-vyädha, the nonviolent hunter, as described in the Varäha Puräëa. In a previous life he somehow became a brahma-räkñasa, or brähmaëa ghost, but was eventually saved. In a previous Kali-yuga he had the association of a Vaiñëava king named Väsu. The lady Kubjä associated directly with Lord Kåñëa, and in her previous birth she had associated with Çré Närada Muni The gopés of Våndävana rendered service to saintly persons in their previous births. Having had ample association with devotees, they became gopés in Våndävana in their next lives and associated with the eternally liberated gopés who had descended there. They also had association with Tulasé-devé, or Våndä-devé. The wives of the brähmaëas performing sacrifice had association with women sent by Lord Kåñëa to sell flower garlands and betel nuts and heard about the Lord from them.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The persons I have mentioned did not undergo serious studies of the Vedic literature, nor did they worship great saintly persons, nor did they execute severe vows or austerities. Simply by association with Me and My devotees, they achieved Me.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Study of the Vedic literature, worship of those who teach the çruti-mantras, acceptance of vows and austerities, etc., as mentioned previously, are helpful processes that please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this verse, however, the Lord again explains that all such processes are secondary to the essential process of associating with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His pure devotees. By other processes one may gain the association of the Lord and His devotees, which will actually give the perfection of life. The word mat-saìgät can also be read as sat-saìgät, with the same meaning. In the reading mat-saìgät ("from association with Me"), mat is also understood to indicate "those who are Mine," or the devotees. Çréla Çrédhara Svämé mentions that a pure devotee can advance in Kåñëa consciousness by his own association, since simply by associating with his own activities and consciousness, he associates with the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The inhabitants of Våndävana, including the gopés, cows, unmoving creatures such as the twin arjuna trees, animals, living entities with stunted consciousness such as bushes and thickets, and snakes such as Käliya, all achieved the perfection of life by unalloyed love for Me and thus very easily achieved Me.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Although innumerable living entities achieved liberation by association with the Lord and His devotees, many such personalities also executed other processes such as austerity, charity, philosophical speculation, and so on. As we have already explained, such procedures are secondary. But the inhabitants of Våndävana such as the gopés did not know anything except Lord Kåñëa, and their whole purpose in life was simply to love Lord Kåñëa, as indicated here by the words kevalena hi bhävena. Even the trees, bushes and hills such as Govardhana loved Lord Kåñëa. As the Lord explains to His brother, Çré Baladeva, in the Tenth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (10.15.5):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">aho amé deva-varämarärcitaà</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">tamo-'pahatyai taru-janma yat-kåtam</div>
<div class="First"> "My dear brother Baladeva, just see how these trees are bowing down with their branches and offering obeisances to Your lotus feet, which are worshipable even by the demigods. Indeed, My dear brother, You are the Supreme God, and thus these trees have produced fruits and flowers as an offering to You. Although a living entity takes birth as a tree due to the mode of ignorance, certainly by such a birth in Våndävana these trees are destroying all darkness in their lives by serving Your lotus feet." Although many living entities achieved the mercy of Lord Kåñëa by associating with the Lord and His devotees in various ways, those who take Lord Kåñëa as everything are situated in the highest process of spiritual realization. Therefore the Lord has not bothered to mention in this verse those who achieved perfection through mixed processes, but rather glorifies the unalloyed devotees of Våndävana, headed by the gopés, who knew nothing but Lord Kåñëa. The residents of Våndävana were so satisfied in their relationships with Lord Kåñëa that they did not pollute their loving service with mental speculation or fruitive desires. The gopés served Lord Kåñëa in the conjugal rasa, or relationship, whereas according to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura the cows loved Lord Kåñëa in vätsalya-rasa, or the love of parents for a child, because the cows were always supplying milk to child Kåñëa. Unmoving objects like Govardhana Hill and other hills and mountains loved Lord Kåñëa as a friend, and the ordinary animals, trees and bushes of Våndävana loved Lord Kåñëa in däsya-rasa, or with love of a servant for his master. Snakes like Käliya also developed this love in servitude, and after relishing their loving service to Lord Kåñëa, all of them went back home, back to Godhead. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, all those inhabitants of Våndävana should be considered eternally liberated souls, as expressed by the word siddhäù, which means "having achieved the perfection of life."</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa here explains that it is very difficult to achieve His personal association, even for one who seriously endeavors to reach the Absolute Truth. The inhabitants of Våndävana, such as the gopés and cows, were always living with Lord Kåñëa, and thus their association is called sat-saìga. Anyone who is favorably living with the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes sat, or eternal, and thus the association of such a person can immediately award others pure devotional service to the Lord. There is an austerity called cändräyaëa, a fast in which one's intake of food is diminished by one mouthful each day as the moon wanes and increased in the same way as the moon waxes. Similarly, there are painstaking ritualistic sacrifices and grueling studies of the Sanskrit Vedic mantras, which one may also teach to others. All these tedious activities cannot award the highest perfection of life unless one gets the causeless mercy of the pure devotees of the Lord.

<div class="Translation"> The residents of Våndävana, headed by the gopés, were always completely attached to Me with deepest love.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> This verse especially describes the sentiments of the cowherd girls of Våndävana, the gopés, and Lord Kåñëa here reveals the incomparable love they felt for Him. As explained in the Tenth Canto, Lord Kåñëa's uncle Akrüra, sent by Kaàsa, came to Våndävana and took Kåñëa and Balaräma back to Mathurä for a wrestling event. The gopés loved Lord Kåñëa so much that in His absence their consciousness was completely absorbed in spiritual love. Thus their Kåñëa consciousness is considered the highest perfectional stage of life. They were always expecting that Lord Kåñëa would finish His business of killing demons and return to them, and therefore their anxiety was an extremely moving, heartrending display of love. Anyone desiring true happiness must take to the devotional service of the Lord in the spirit of the gopés, giving up everything for the pleasure of the Supreme Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Dear Uddhava, all of those nights that the gopés spent with Me, their most dearly beloved, in the land of Våndävana seemed to them to pass in less than a moment. Bereft of My association, however, the gopés felt that those same nights dragged on forever, as if each night were equal to a day of Brahmä.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Çrédhara Svämé comments as follows. "The gopés suffered extreme anxiety in the absence of Lord Kåñëa, and though outwardly appearing bewildered, they actually achieved the highest perfectional stage of samädhi. Their consciousness was intensely and intimately attached to Lord Kåñëa, and by such Kåñëa consciousness their own bodies seemed very far away from them, even though people normally consider their body to be their closest possession. In fact, the gopés did not think about their own existence. Although a young woman normally considers her husband and children to be her dearmost possessions, the gopés did not even consider the existence of their so-called families. Nor could they think of this world or life after death. Indeed, they were not at all aware of these things. Just like great sages who become detached from the names and forms of the material world, the gopés could not think of anything, because they were rapt in loving remembrance of Lord Kåñëa. Just as rivers enter the ocean, similarly, the gopés completely merged into consciousness of Lord Kåñëa through intense love."</div>
<div class="First"> Thus a day of Brahmä seemed like a single moment for the gopés when Lord Kåñëa was present with them, and a single moment seemed like a day of Brahmä when Lord Kåñëa was absent. The Kåñëa consciousness of the gopés is the perfection of spiritual life, and the symptoms of such perfection are described here.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> My dear Uddhava, just as great sages in yoga trance merge into self-realization, like rivers merging into the ocean, and are thus not aware of material names and forms, similarly, the gopés of Våndävana were so completely attached to Me within their minds that they could not think of their own bodies, or of this world, or of their future lives. Their entire consciousness was simply bound up in Me.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The words svam ätmänam adas tathedam indicate that while for ordinary persons one's personal body is the most near and dear thing, the gopés considered their own bodies to be distant and remote, just as a yogé in samädhi trance considers ordinary things around his physical body or his physical body itself to be most remote. When Kåñëa played on His flute late at night, the gopés immediately forgot everything about their so-called husbands and children and went to dance with Lord Kåñëa in the forest. These controversial points have been clearly explained in the book Kåñëa, by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda. The basic explanation is that Lord Kåñëa is the source of everything, and the gopés are the Lord's own potency. Thus there is no discrepancy or immorality in the almighty Personality of Godhead's loving affairs with His own manifest potency, the gopés, who happen to be the most beautiful young girls in the creation of God. There is no illusion on the part of the gopés, for they are so attracted to Lord Kåñëa that they do not care to think of anything else. Since all existence is situated within the body of Lord Kåñëa, there is no loss for the gopés when they concentrate on the Lord. It is the nature of very deep love to exclude all objects except the beloved. However, in the material world, where we try to love a limited temporary object such as our nation, family or personal body, our exclusion of other objects constitutes ignorance. But when our love is intensely concentrated on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the origin of everything, such concentration cannot be considered ignorance or small-mindedness.</div>
<div class="First"> The example of the sages in samädhi is given here only to illustrate exclusive concentration on a single object. Otherwise, there is no comparison between the ecstatic love of the gopés and the dry meditation of the yogés, who merely try to understand that they are not their material bodies. Since the gopés had no material bodies to become detached from and were personally dancing with and embracing the Absolute Truth, one can never compare the exalted position of the gopés to that of mere yogés. It is stated that the bliss of impersonal Brahman realization cannot be compared to even an atomic fragment of the blissful ocean of love of Kåñëa. Intimate attachment is like a strong rope that binds the mind and heart. In material life we are bound to that which is temporary and illusory, and therefore such binding of the heart causes great pain. However, if we bind our minds and hearts to the eternal Lord Kåñëa, the reservoir of all pleasure and beauty, then our hearts will expand unlimitedly in the ocean of transcendental bliss. One should understand that the gopés were not in any way inclined toward impersonal meditation, in which one denies the reality of variegated creation. The gopés did not deny anything; they simply loved Kåñëa and could not think of anything else. They only rejected whatever impeded their concentration on Lord Kåñëa, cursing even their own eyelids, which blinked and thus removed Kåñëa from their sight for a split second. Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé has stated that all sincere devotees of the Lord should have the courage to remove from their lives anything that impedes their progressive march back home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The words asvarüpa-vidaù ("not understanding My actual position or form") indicate that the lovely gopés were so completely absorbed in conjugal love for Lord Kåñëa that they were not aware of the Lord's unlimited potencies as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains this and other meanings of the word asvarüpa-vidaù. In Sanskrit the word vid also means "to acquire." Thus, asvarüpa-vidaù indicates that the gopés, like other pure devotees of the Lord, were not interested in achieving särüpya-mukti, the liberation of acquiring a bodily form similar to the Lord's. Were the gopés to obtain a bodily form like the Lord's, how could the Lord execute His conjugal pastimes of dancing with the gopés and embracing them? Since the gopés had realized their eternal spiritual forms as servitors of the Lord, the word svarüpa also may indicate their own spiritual bodies, and thus asvarüpa-vidaù means that the gopés never thought, as materialists do, of their own bodily beauty. Although the gopés are the most beautiful girls in the Lord's creation, they never thought of their own bodies but rather were always meditating on the transcendental body of Lord Kåñëa. Although we cannot imitate the gopé's exalted conjugal feelings, we can follow their superb example of practical Kåñëa consciousness. They naturally took shelter of Lord Kåñëa and achieved the highest perfection of life.</div>

<div class="First"> Çré Uddhava inquired from Lord Kåñëa about the symptoms of saintly persons and liberated souls, and the Lord has replied in terms of different levels of spiritual advancement, distinguishing between those who are able to understand Lord Kåñëa to be the principal goal of life and those loving devotees who accept Lord Kåñëa and devotional service to Him as the only goal of life. Lord Kåñëa also mentioned that He is captured by His loving devotees and even by those who sincerely associate with His loving devotees. Among all the devotees, the gopés of Våndävana were described by the Lord as having achieved such a rare state of pure devotional service that Lord Kåñëa personally feels constantly indebted to them. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, Lord Kåñëa previously kept the gopés' love for Him concealed in His heart because of its confidential nature and the Lord's own gravity. Finally, however, even Lord Kåñëa could not remain silent about the intense love of the gopés, and thus in these verses the Lord reveals to Uddhava how the gopés loved Him in Våndävana and brought Him fully under their control. The Lord would relax in secret places with the loving gopés, and by conjugal spontaneous affection the greatest love was exchanged between them. As explained by the Lord in Bhagavad-gétä, one cannot achieve the perfection of life merely by renouncing the material world or by executing ordinary, sectarian religious principles. One must actually understand the identity of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and by associating with His pure devotees one must learn to love the Lord in His personal, original form. This love may be expressed in either the conjugal, paternal, fraternal or serving rasa, or relationship. The Lord has elaborately explained to Uddhava the system of philosophical analysis of the material world, and now He clearly concludes that it is useless for Uddhava to waste time in fruitive activities or mental speculation. Actually, Lord Kåñëa is hinting that Uddhava should assimilate the example of the gopés and try to advance further in Kåñëa consciousness by following in the footsteps of the cowherd damsels of Vraja. Any conditioned soul who is unsatisfied with the cruel laws of nature, which impose disease, old age and death, should understand that Lord Kåñëa can deliver all living beings from the problems of material existence. There is no need to entangle oneself in unauthorized, sectarian rituals, injunctions or prohibitions. One should simply surrender to Lord Kåñëa, following the example of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, who is Lord Kåñëa Himself. By the authorized regulated process of bhakti-yoga, Kåñëa consciousness, one easily achieves spiritual perfection.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In the first verse of the Tenth Chapter of this canto, the Lord stated that one should take shelter of Him and execute one's duties within the varëäçrama system without material desire. Uddhava interpreted this statement as recommending karma-miçrä bhakti, or devotional service mixed with a tendency toward fruitive activities. It is a fact that until one understands Lord Kåñëa to be everything, it is not possible to retire from ordinary, worldly duties. Rather, one is encouraged to offer the fruits of such work to the Lord. In verse 4 of the Tenth Chapter, the Lord recommended that one retire from worldly duties and systematically cultivate knowledge, accepting Him as the Supreme. Uddhava understood this instruction to indicate jïäna-miçrä bhakti, or devotional service to the Lord mixed with the secondary desire to accumulate knowledge. Beginning with verse 35 of the Tenth Chapter, Uddhava inquired about the process of material conditioning and liberation from material life. The Lord replied elaborately, stating that without devotional service the process of philosophical speculation can never be perfected. In Chapter Eleven, verse 18, the Lord emphasized the importance of faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and in verse 23 Kåñëa extensively widened His discussion of devotional service, emphasizing that one should be faithful and hear and chant the glories of the Lord. The Lord concluded that both the development and perfection of devotional service depend on association with the devotees. In verse 26 of the Eleventh Chapter, Uddhava inquired about the actual ways and means of devotional service and about the symptoms of devotional perfection. And in verse 48 Lord Kåñëa stated that unless one takes to the process of devotional service, one's attempt for liberation will be useless. One must associate with the devotees of the Lord and follow in their footsteps. Finally, in verse 14 of this chapter the Lord categorically rejected the paths of fruitive activities and mental speculation and in verse 15 recommended that one exclusively surrender unto Him with all one's heart.</div>
<div class="First"> Having received such elaborate and technical instructions on the perfection of life, Uddhava is bewildered, and his mind is afflicted with doubt about what he should actually do. Lord Kåñëa has described many procedures and the results of such procedures, all of which ultimately lead to the single goal of Lord Kåñëa Himself. Uddhava therefore desires that Lord Kåñëa state in simple terms what should be done. Arjuna makes a similar request of the Lord at the beginning of the Third Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, Uddhava is stating here, "My dear friend Kåñëa, first You recommended that I perform worldly activities within the varëäçrama system, and then You advised that I reject such activities and take to the path of philosophical research. Now rejecting the path of jïäna, You recommend that I simply surrender unto You in bhakti-yoga. If I accept Your decision, in the future You may again go back to Your original point and recommend worldly activities." By his boldness in disclosing his mind, Uddhava reveals his intimate friendship with Lord Kåñëa.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura comments as follows on the dialogue between Lord Kåñëa and Uddhava. Uddhava was bewildered and doubtful because Lord Kåñëa explained many different processes such as devotional service, speculative knowledge, renunciation, mystic yoga, austerities, pious duties, and so on. However, all of these processes are meant to help the living entities obtain the shelter of Lord Kåñëa, and ultimately no Vedic process should be understood in any other way. Thus Lord Kåñëa explained the entire Vedic system, placing everything in proper order. In fact, Lord Kåñëa was surprised that Uddhava foolishly thought that he was meant to practice every process, as if each method were meant simply for him. Lord Kåñëa therefore wants to inform His devotee, "My dear Uddhava, when I told you that analytic knowledge is to be practiced, pious duties are to be performed, devotional service is obligatory, yoga procedures must be observed, austerities are to be executed, etc., I was instructing all living entities, using you as My immediate audience. That which I have spoken, am speaking now and will speak in the future should be understood as guidance for all living entities in different situations. How could you possibly think that you were meant to practice all of the different Vedic processes? I accept you as you are now, My pure devotee. You are not supposed to execute all of these processes." Thus according to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the Lord, with lighthearted and encouraging words, reveals to Uddhava the deep purpose behind the variety of Vedic procedures.</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa became manifest from the mouth of Lord Brahmä in the form of the Vedas. The word vivara-prasüti in this verse also indicates that the Lord is manifest within the ädhärädi-cakras situated within the body of Lord Brahmä. The word ghoñeëa means "subtle sound," and guhäà praviñöaù also indicates that Lord Kåñëa enters within the ädhära-cakra. The Lord can further be perceived within other cakras such as the maëipüraka-cakra, located around the navel, and the viçuddhi-cakra. The Sanskrit alphabet is composed of short and long vowels, and consonants pronounced with high and low tones, and utilizing these vibrations the different branches of Vedic literatures are manifested as a gross form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to Bhagavad-gétä, such literatures deal mostly with the three modes of material nature: traiguëya-viñayä vedä nistrai-guëyo bhavärjuna. Çréla Çrédhara Svämé explains that due to the control of the illusory energy, mäyä, the Personality of Godhead appears to the conditioned souls as part of the material universe. The imagined imposition of gross and subtle material qualities on the Personality of Godhead is called avidyä, or ignorance, and through such ignorance the living entity considers himself to be the doer of his own activities and becomes bound up in the network of karma. The Vedas therefore order an entangled soul to observe positive and negative injunctions to purify his existence. These procedures are called pravåtti-märga, or the path of regulated fruitive activities. When one has purified one's existence, one gives up this gross stage of fruitive activities because it is detrimental to the practice of pure devotional service. By firm faith one may then worship the Personality of Godhead. One who has developed perfect Kåñëa consciousness no longer has to perform ritualistic duties. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, tasya käryaà na vidyate. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, this verse may be understood in another way. The word jéva indicates Lord Kåñëa, who gives life to the residents of Våndävana, and vivara-prasüti indicates that although Lord Kåñëa eternally performs His pastimes in the spiritual world, beyond the vision of the conditioned souls, He also enters within the material universe to display these same pastimes. The words guhäà praviñöaù indicates that after displaying such pastimes, the Lord withdraws them and enters into His unmanifest pastimes, or those pastimes not manifest to the conditioned souls. In this case, mäträ indicates the transcendental senses of the Lord, svara indicates the Lord's transcendental sound vibration and singing, and the word varëa indicates the transcendental form of the Lord. The word sthaviñöha, or "gross manifestation," means that the Lord becomes manifest in the material world even to those devotees who are not completely advanced in Kåñëa consciousness and whose vision is not completely purified. Mano-maya indicates that somehow or other Lord Kåñëa is to be kept within one's mind; and for the nondevotees Lord Kåñëa is sükñma, or most subtle, because He cannot be known. Thus different äcäryas have glorified Lord Kåñëa in different ways through the transcendental sound vibration of this verse.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa here explains the most confidential meaning of Vedic knowledge. The Vedas first regulate ordinary material work and channel the fruits into ritualistic sacrifices, which ostensibly reward the performer with future benefits. The real purpose of these sacrifices, however, is to accustom a materialistic worker to offering the fruits of his work to a superior Vedic authority. An expert fruitive worker gradually exhausts the possibilities of material enjoyment and naturally gravitates toward the superior stage of philosophical speculation on his existential situation. By increased knowledge, one becomes aware of the unlimited glories of the Supreme and gradually takes to the process of loving devotional service to the transcendental Absolute Truth. Lord Kåñëa is the goal of Vedic knowledge, as the Lord states in Bhagavad-gétä: vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù [Bg. 15.15]. The Lord gradually becomes manifest in the progression of Vedic rituals, just as fire is gradually manifest by the rubbing of firewood. The words haviñä samedhate ("the fire increases by addition of ghee") indicate that by the progressive advancement of Vedic sacrifice, the fire of spiritual knowledge gradually blazes, illuminating everything and destroying the chain of fruitive work. Lord Kåñëa considered Uddhava to be the most qualified person to hear this elaborate transcendental knowledge; therefore the Lord mercifully instructs Uddhava so that he may enlighten the sages at Badarikäçrama, thus fulfilling the purpose of the sages' lives.</div>

A Kåñëa conscious person sees the entire material world as a manifestation of the Lord's potencies. There is therefore no legitimate scope for material sense gratification, because everything is an expansion from the Supreme Personality of Godhead and belongs to Him. One who can understand the expansion of the Lord within subtle and gross material manifestations gives up his desire to live in this world. In the spiritual world everything is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge. The exclusive feature of the material world is that here the living entity dreams that he is lord. A sane person, giving up this hallucination, finds no attractive features in the kingdom of mäyä and therefore returns home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> When many seeds are placed in an agricultural field, innumerable manifestations of trees, bushes, vegetables and so on will arise from a single source, the soil. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who gives life to all and is eternal, originally exists beyond the scope of the cosmic manifestation. In the course of time, however, the Lord, who is the resting place of the three modes of nature and the source of the universal lotus flower, in which the cosmic manifestation takes place, divides His material potencies and thus appears to be manifest in innumerable forms, although He is one.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Véraräghaväcärya comments that one may question as to whom the cosmic manifestation, consisting of demigods, men, animals, plants, planets, space, etc., actually belongs. Lord Kåñëa now eradicates any doubt about the source of the cosmic manifestation. The word tri-våt indicates that the three modes of nature are not independent but are under superior control. The suffix våt means the vartanam, or "existence," of the three modes of material nature within the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Analyzing the term abja-yoni, ap indicates "water," and ja indicates "birth." Thus abja means the complex material universe, which sprouts from Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, who lies in the Garbhodaka Ocean. Yoni, or "source," indicates the Personality of Godhead, and thus abja-yoni means that the Lord is the source of all cosmic manifestations; indeed, all creation takes place within the Lord. Since the three modes of material nature are under the superior control of the Lord, material objects helplessly undergo creation and annihilation within the universal shell by the will of the Lord. The term avyakta indicates the Lord's subtle spiritual form, which exists alone before the material creation. The Lord's original form, being spiritual, does not undergo birth, transformation or death. It is eternal. In the course of time, the Lord's material potencies are divided and manifest as bodies, bodily paraphernalia, sense objects, bodily expansions, false ego and false proprietorship. Thus the Lord expands His conscious living potency called jéva-çakti, which is manifest in innumerable material forms such as those of men, demigods, animals, and so on. From the example of the seeds sown in an agricultural field, we can understand that innumerable manifestations may arise from a single source. Similarly, although the Lord is one, He becomes manifest in innumerable forms through the expansion of His different potencies.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Just as woven cloth rests on the expansion of lengthwise and crosswise threads, similarly the entire universe is expanded on the lengthwise and crosswise potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is situated within Him. The conditioned soul has been accepting material bodies since time immemorial, and these bodies are like great trees sustaining one's material existence. Just as a tree first blossoms and then produces fruit, similarly the tree of material existence, one's material body, produces the various results of material existence.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Before a tree produces fruit, blossoms appear. Similarly, the word puñpa-phale, according to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, indicates the happiness and distress of material existence. One's material life may appear to be blossoming, but ultimately there will appear the bitter fruits of old age, death and other catastrophes. Attachment to the material body, which is always inclined toward sense gratification, is the root cause of material existence, and it is therefore called saàsära-taru. The tendency to exploit the external energy of the Supreme Lord has existed since time immemorial, as expressed by the words puräëaù karmätmakaù. The material universe is an expansion of the illusory potency of the Supreme Lord and is always dependent on Him and nondifferent from Him. This simple understanding can relieve the conditioned souls from endless wandering in the unhappy kingdom of mäyä.</div>
<div class="First"> The word puñpa-phale may also be understood as meaning sense gratification and liberation. The tree of material existence will be further explained in the following verses.</div>

Two birds, namely the individual soul and the Supersoul, have made their nest in this tree, and the three types of bark are air, bile and mucus, the constituent elements of the body.

Rather, it is clearly stated by the words vidyä-kuöhäreëa that one should cultivate knowledge of the material world as described by Lord Kåñëa in this chapter. One should fully understand that each and every aspect of the material creation is the expansion of the illusory potency of the Lord. Such knowledge works as a sharpened ax to cut down the roots of material existence. In this way, even the stubborn subtle body, created by the three modes of nature, is cut to pieces, and one becomes apramatta, or sane and cautious in Kåñëa consciousness.</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa has clearly explained in this chapter that the cowherd damsels of Våndävana were not interested in an analytical approach to life. They simply loved Lord Kåñëa and could not think of anything else. Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu taught that all His devotees should follow in the footsteps of the cowherd damsels of Vraja in order to develop the highest intensity of selfless love of Godhead. Lord Kåñëa has elaborately analyzed the nature of the material world so that the conditioned souls, who are trying to enjoy it, can cut down the tree of material existence with this knowledge. The words sampadya cätmänam indicate that a person with such knowledge has no further material existence, because he has already achieved the Personality of Godhead. Such a person should not loiter in the kingdom of mäyä, perpetually refining his understanding of the illusory creation. One who has accepted Lord Kåñëa as everything may enjoy eternal bliss in the Lord's service. Yet even though he remains in this world, he has no more business with it and gives up the analytical procedures for negating it. Lord Kåñëa therefore tells Uddhava, tyajästram: "Give up the ax of analytic knowledge by which you have cut down your sense of proprietorship and residence in the material world." Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Twelfth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Beyond Renunciation and Knowledge."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 13. The Haàsa-avatära Answers the Questions of the Sons of</div>
<div class="First"> Brahmä</div>
<div class="First"> In this chapter, Lord Çré Kåñëa explains to Uddhava how human beings, overwhelmed by sense gratification, become bound by the three modes of nature, and how to renounce these modes. The Lord then describes how He appeared in His form of Haàsa before Brahmä and the four sages headed by Sanaka and revealed to them various confidential truths. The three modes-goodness, passion and ignorance-are related to material intelligence, not to the soul. One should conquer the lower modes of passion and ignorance by the mode of goodness, and then one must surpass the mode of goodness by acting in the transcendental mode of pure goodness. By associating with things in the mode of goodness, one becomes more fully situated in that mode. The three modes increase their different influences through various types of scripture, water, place, time, beneficiaries of activity, natures of activity, birth, meditation, mantras, purificatory rituals, and so on. Lacking discrimination, one identifies with the material body, and consequently the mode of passion, which produces misery, takes over the mind, which is normally in the mode of goodness. As the mind evolves its function of decision and doubt, it creates intolerable hankerings for sense gratification. Unfortunate persons who are bewildered by the urges of the mode of passion become the slaves of their senses. Even though they know that the eventual result of their work will be suffering, they cannot avoid engaging in such fruitive work. A discriminating person, on the other hand, keeps himself detached from the objects of the senses and, by utilizing appropriate renunciation, takes shelter of unalloyed devotional service. Lord Brahmä himself has no material cause. He is the cause of the creation of all living beings and is the greatest among all the demigods. Yet even Brahmä is always suffering agitation of the mind on account of the duties he has to perform; therefore, when he was questioned by his sons headed by Sanaka, who were born from his mind, about the means for driving away desires for sense gratification, he was incapable of giving them an answer. In order to receive some insight into this matter, he took shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whereupon the Supreme Lord appeared before him in the form of the swan incarnation, Lord Haàsa. Lord Haàsa proceeded to give instructions about the categorical identity of the self, the different states of consciousness (wakeful awareness, sleep and deep sleep) and the means for conquering over material existence. The sages headed by Sanaka became freed from all their doubts by hearing the words of the Lord and worshiped Him with pure devotion in mature love of God.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: The three modes of material nature, namely goodness, passion and ignorance, pertain to material intelligence and not to the spirit soul. By development of material goodness one can conquer the modes of passion and ignorance, and by cultivation of transcendental goodness one may free oneself even from material goodness.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Goodness in the material world never exists in a pure form. Therefore, it is common knowledge that on the material platform no one is working without personal motivation. In the material world goodness is always mixed with some amount of passion and ignorance, whereas spiritual, or purified, goodness (viçuddha-sattva) represents the liberated platform of perfection. Materially, one is proud to be an honest, compassionate man, but unless one is fully Kåñëa conscious one will speak truths that are not ultimately significant, and one will give mercy that is ultimately useless. Because the onward march of material time removes all situations and persons from the material stage, our so-called mercy and truth apply to situations that shortly will not exist. Real truth is eternal, and real mercy means to situate people in eternal truth. Still, for an ordinary person, cultivation of material goodness may be a preliminary stage on the road to Kåñëa consciousness. For example, it is stated in the Tenth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam that one who is addicted to meat-eating cannot understand the pastimes of Lord Kåñëa. By cultivation of the material mode of goodness, however, one may become a vegetarian and perhaps come to appreciate the sublime process of Kåñëa consciousness. Since it is clearly stated in Bhagavad-gétä that the material modes of nature constantly rotate, one must take advantage of an elevated position in material goodness to step onto the transcendental platform. Otherwise, as the wheel of time turns one will again go into the darkness of material ignorance.</div>

<div class="Translation"> When the living entity becomes strongly situated in the mode of goodness, then religious principles, characterized by devotional service to Me, become prominent. One can strengthen the mode of goodness by cultivation of those things that are already situated in goodness, and thus religious principles arise.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Since the three modes of material nature are constantly in conflict, vying for supremacy, how is it possible that the mode of goodness can subdue the modes of passion and ignorance? Lord Kåñëa here explains how one can be strongly fixed in the mode of goodness, which automatically gives rise to religious principles. In the Fourteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä, Lord Kåñëa elaborately explains the things that are in goodness, passion and ignorance. Thus, by choosing food, attitudes, work, recreation, etc., strictly in the mode of goodness, one will become situated in that mode. The usefulness of sattva-guëa, or the mode of goodness, is that it produces religious principles aimed at and characterized by devotional service to Lord Kåñëa. Without such devotional service to the Lord, the mode of goodness is considered useless and merely another aspect of material illusion. The word våddhät, or "strengthened, increased," indicates clearly that one should come to the platform of viçuddha-sattva, or purified goodness. The word våddhät indicates growth, and growth should not be stopped until full maturity is reached. The full maturity of goodness is called véçuddha-sattva, or the transcendental platform on which there is no trace of any other quality. In pure goodness all knowledge automatically manifests, and one can easily understand one's eternal loving relationship with Lord Kåñëa. That is the actual meaning and purpose of dharma, or religious principles.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Madhväcärya points out in this regard that an increase in the mode of goodness strengthens religious principles and the invigorated execution of religious principles strengthens the mode of goodness. In that way, one can advance higher and higher in the mode of spiritual happiness.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Until one revives one's direct knowledge of the spirit soul and drives away the illusory identification with the material body and mind caused by the three modes of nature, one must cultivate those things in the mode of goodness. By increasing the mode of goodness, one automatically can understand and practice religious principles, and by such practice transcendental knowledge is awakened.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> One who desires to cultivate the mode of goodness must consider the following points. One should study religious scriptures that teach detachment from mental speculation and material sense gratification, not scriptures that provide rituals and mantras to increase material ignorance. Such materialistic scriptures do not give attention to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus are basically atheistic. One should accept pure water for quenching thirst and cleaning the body. There is no need for a devotee to use colognes, perfume, whiskey, beer, etc., which are all polluted manifestations of water. One should associate with persons who are cultivating detachment from the material world and not with those who are materially attached or sinful in their behavior. One should live in a solitary place where devotional service is practiced and discussed among Vaiñëavas. One should not be spontaneously attracted to busy highways, shopping centers, sports stadiums, and so on. Concerning time, one should rise by four o'clock in the morning and utilize the auspicious brähma-muhürta to advance in Kåñëa consciousness. Similarly, one should avoid the sinful influence of hours such as midnight when ghosts and demons are encouraged to become active. Concerning work, one should execute one's prescribed duties, follow the regulative principles of spiritual life and utilize all of one's energy for pious purposes. Time should not be wasted in frivolous or materialistic activities, of which there are now literally millions in modern society. One can cultivate birth in the mode of goodness by accepting the second birth of initiation from a bona fide spiritual master and learning to chant the Hare Kåñëa mantra. One should not accept initiation or so-called spiritual birth in unauthorized mystical or religious cults in the modes of passion and ignorance. One should meditate upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the enjoyer of all sacrifices, and similarly, one should meditate on the lives of great devotees and saintly persons. One should not meditate on lusty women and envious men. Concerning mantras, one should follow the example of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu by chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra and not other songs, verses, poetry or mantras that glorify the kingdom of illusion. Purificatory rituals should be performed to purify the spirit soul and not to bring down material blessings on one's material household. One who increases the mode of goodness will certainly become fixed in religious principles, and automatically knowledge will arise. As knowledge increases one is able to understand the eternal spirit soul and the Supreme Soul, Lord Kåñëa. Thus the soul becomes free from the artificial imposition of the gross and subtle material bodies caused by the modes of material nature. Spiritual knowledge burns to ashes the material designations that cover the living entity, and one's real, eternal life begins.</div>

<div class="Translation"> In a bamboo forest the wind sometimes rubs the bamboo stalks together, and such friction generates a blazing fire that consumes the very source of its birth, the bamboo forest. Thus, the fire is automatically calmed by its own action. Similarly, by the competition and interaction of the material modes of nature, the subtle and gross material bodies are generated. If one uses his mind and body to cultivate knowledge, then such enlightenment destroys the influence of the modes of nature that generated one's body. Thus, like the fire, the body and mind are pacified by their own actions in destroying the source of their birth.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word guëa-vyatyaya-jaù is significant in this verse. Vyatyaya indicates change or inversion in the normal order of things. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has described the concept of vyatyaya by giving the Sanskrit synonym vaiñamya, which indicates inequality or disproportionate diversity. Thus, it is understood by the term guëa-vyatyaya-jaù that the body is generated by the unstable relationships of the three modes of material nature, which exist everywhere in constantly changing proportions. There is constant strife among the modes of nature. A good person is sometimes torn by passion, and a passionate person sometimes wants to give up everything and rest. An ignorant person may sometimes become disgusted with his depraved life, and a passionate person may sometimes indulge in bad habits in the mode of ignorance. Due to the interactive conflict of the modes of nature, one wanders throughout material nature creating one body after another by one's own work, karma. As it is said, variety is the mother of enjoyment, and the variety of material modes gives hope to the conditioned souls that by changing their material situation their unhappiness and frustration can be turned into happiness and satisfaction. But even if one acquires relative material happiness, that will soon be disturbed by the inevitable flux of the material modes.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The standard methods of enjoyment in the material world are sex, money and false prestige, all of which are obtained with great suffering and eventually lost. One engaged in material life suffers in the present and has only a very bleak future to look forward to in the continuing cycle of birth and death. Thus, how can human beings who have seen these things and know them very well continue to enjoy life like dogs, asses and goats? Often a dog will approach a bitch for sex, but the lady dog may not be attracted and will show her teeth, snarl and threaten the poor dog with serious injury. Still he goes about his business trying to get a little sex pleasure. Similarly, many times a dog risks being beaten or shot while stealing some food in a place where he knows he should not go. The ass is very attracted to the she-ass, but the lady ass often kicks him in the legs. Similarly, the ass's master gives the ass a handful of grass, which the poor ass could get anywhere, and then burdens him with great loads. The goat is generally raised for slaughter, and even when the goat is brought into the slaughterhouse he shamelessly goes after the lady goat to get sex pleasure. In this way, even at the risk of being shot, bitten, beaten and slaughtered, animals persist in their foolish sense gratification. How can an educated human being commit himself to such a condemned way of life, wherein the result is practically the same as that of the animals? If by cultivating the mode of goodness one's life is filled with happiness, enlightenment and future rewards, why would anyone cultivate the modes of passion and ignorance? This is Uddhava's question.</div>

<div class="First"> Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has quoted three verses from the Second Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam as follows. In the Ninth Chapter, verse 32, Lord Kåñëa blessed Brahmä with realized knowledge of the Lord's actual form, qualities and activities. In the Ninth Chapter, verse 37, the Lord ordered Brahmä to rigidly carry out the Lord's injunctions and affirmed that Brahmä would thus never be bewildered in his cosmic decision-making. In the Sixth Chapter, verse 34, Lord Brahmä assured his son Närada, "O Närada, because I have caught hold of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, with great zeal, whatever I say has never proved to have been false, nor is the progress of my mind ever deterred, nor are my senses ever degraded by temporary attachment to matter."</div>
<div class="First"> In the present verse in this Thirteenth Chapter of the Eleventh Canto, Lord Kåñëa states that Brahmä unfortunately did become bewildered by his creative functions, thus providing a grave lesson to all of the Lord's empowered representatives. Although one may be elevated to an exalted position in the Lord's transcendental service, at any moment there is danger of false pride polluting one's devotional mentality.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> My dear brähmaëas, if, when asking Me who I am, you believe that I am also a jéva soul and that there is no ultimate difference between us—since all souls are ultimately one without individuality—then how is your question possible or appropriate? Ultimately, what is the real situation or resting place both of yourselves and of Me?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Äçraya means "the resting place" or "shelter." Lord Kåñëa's question "That is our actual resting place or shelter?" means "What is our ultimate nature or constitutional position?" This is because no one can come to rest or be satisfied unless one is in one's natural position. The example is given that one may travel all over the world, but ultimately one becomes satisfied by returning to one's own home. Similarly, a crying child is satisfied when embraced by its own mother. By inquiring about the shelter or resting place of Himself and the brähmaëas, the Lord is indicating the eternal, constitutional position of every living entity</div>
<div class="First"> If Lord Kåñëa were also in the jéva category, and if all living entities including Him were thus equal, there would be no deep purpose in one living entity inquiring and another answering. Only one who is in a superior position can meaningfully answer important questions. It may be argued that the bona fide spiritual master answers all the questions of the disciple, and yet the guru is in the jéva category. The answer is that the bona fide spiritual master speaks not on his own behalf but as a representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is in the Viñëu category. A so-called guru speaking on his own behalf as a jéva soul is useless and is unable to meaningfully answer serious questions. Thus, the sages' question ko bhavän ("Who are You?") indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally an individual person. And because the sages headed by Lord Brahmä offered obeisances and worshiped the Lord, it is understood that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Brahmä, as the first created being in this universe, could not accept any other living entity except the Lord as worshipable.</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa's actual purpose is to explain the ultimate perfection of yoga, which the sages were desiring to know. If one becomes fixed in transcendental knowledge, the mutual attraction between the material mind and the material sense objects automatically ceases. The spiritual mind is not attracted to material objects of gratification, and thus by spiritualizing the mind, material existence automatically slackens. By questioning the propriety of the sages' question, the Lord is assuming the position of the spiritual master and preparing to give valuable instructions. One should never be envious of a bona fide spiritual master, especially if, as in the case of Lord Haàsa speaking to the sages headed by Brahmä and Sanaka-kumära, the guru is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.</div>

Thus, it appears that in asking My identity, you are merely speaking words, without any real meaning or purpose.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains this verse as follows. "In the previous verse Lord Kåñëa demonstrated that if the sages accepted the impersonal philosophy that all living beings are ultimately one in all respects, their question 'Who are You?' was meaningless, since there would be no philosophical basis to distinguish one manifestation of spirit soul from another. In this verse the Lord refutes the false identification with the material body composed of five elements. If the sages accepted the body as the self, then their question was meaningless, since they would have to ask, 'Who are you five?' If the sages replied that although the body is composed basically of five elements and these elements combine and thus form one unique substance, then the Lord has already replied by the words samäneñu ca vastutaù. The bodies of human beings, demigods, animals, etc., are all composed of the same five elements and are essentially the same. Therefore the question 'Who are You?' is ultimately meaningless. Thus, if one accepts either the theory that all living entities are ultimately the same or the theory that all living entities are ultimately nondifferent from their material bodies, in both cases the question of the sages is meaningless.</div>
<div class="First"> "The sages might argue that even among learned persons it is common practice to ask questions and give answers on many subjects as a part of normal life. The sages could point out that Lord Kåñëa also distinguished among them, by His saying vipräù, 'O brähmaëas,' and vaù, or 'your [question],' as expressed in this verse. In this way it is seen that the Lord also accepts the ordinary customs of questions and answers. To answer this argument, Lord Kåñëa states, väcärambho hy anarthakaù. The Lord states, 'My addressing you as brähmaëas is merely an exhibition of words if we are ultimately not different. I merely reciprocated with your approach to Me. Therefore, if we are ultimately one, neither My statement nor your question has any real meaning. I can conclude therefore by your question to Me that you are all not actually very intelligent. Therefore, why are you inquiring after ultimate knowledge? Aren't you all embarrassed?'"</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Madhväcärya points out in this regard that the question of the sages was not appropriate, since they had already seen their father, Lord Brahmä, worshiping the lotus feet of Lord Haàsa. Since their spiritual master and father was worshiping Lord Haàsa, they should have immediately understood the Lord's position, and their question is thus meaningless.</div>

<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa has already explained that if the sages consider all living entities to be the same, or if they consider the living entity to be the same as his body, then their question ("Who are You?") is inappropriate. Now the Lord refutes the conception that He is a Supreme God far beyond and different from everything within this world. Modern agnostic philosophers preach that God created the world and then retired or went away. According to them, God has no tangible connection with this world, nor does He interfere in human affairs. Ultimately, they claim, God is so great that He cannot be known; therefore no one should waste time trying to understand God. To refute such foolish ideas, the Lord here explains that since everything is the expansion of His potency, He is not different from anything. Nothing can exist separately from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus everything shares in the Lord's nature, although some manifestations are superior and others inferior. The Lord is testing the intelligence of the sages by pointing out various contradictions in their questions. Even if the Lord is supreme, He is not different from His creation; therefore, what is the meaning of the question "Who are You?" We can clearly see that the Lord is paving the way for a deep discussion of spiritual knowledge.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa in the form of Haàsa-avatära, on the pretext of finding contradictions in the simple inquiry of the sons of Brahmä ("Who are You?"), is actually preparing to teach the sages perfect spiritual knowledge, but only after first rejecting two false concepts of life, namely that all living entities are the same in all respects and that the living entity is identical with his outward or subtle body. Lord Kåñëa now answers the difficult question that puzzled even Lord Brahmä. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the sons of Lord Brahmä were thinking as follows. "Our dear Lord, if it is indeed true that we are unintelligent, still Your Lordship has stated that You are actually everything because everything is the expansion of Your potency. Therefore, You are also the mind and the sense objects, which are the subject matter of our question. The material sense objects always enter into the functions of the mind, and similarly, the mind always enters into the material sense objects. Thus, it is proper that we inquire from Your Lordship about the process by which the sense objects will no longer enter the mind and the mind will no longer enter the sense objects. Please be merciful and give us the answer." The Lord answers as follows. "My dear sons, it is a fact that the mind enters into the material sense objects and the sense objects into the mind. Thus, although the living entity is actually part and parcel of Me, being, as I am also, eternally conscious, and although the eternal form of the living entity is spiritual, in conditioned life the living entity artificially imposes upon himself the mind and sense objects, which act as covering designations of the eternal soul. Since it is the natural function of the material mind and sense objects to mutually interact, how can you possibly endeavor to prevent such a mutual attraction? Since both the material mind and sense objects are useless, they both should be completely given up, and thus automatically you will be free from all material duality."</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Çrédhara Svämé points out that the symptom of the material mind is the tendency to consider oneself to be the ultimate doer and enjoyer. Naturally, one with such a puffed-up mentality is helplessly attracted by the sense objects. One who considers himself to be the doer and enjoyer will be irresistibly attracted to the means for attaining sense gratification and false prestige, namely, exploitation of material objects. Above the material mind, however, is intelligence, which can perceive the existence of the eternal spirit soul. It is not possible to separate the material mind from the sense objects, because they naturally exist together. Therefore, by intelligence, one must realize one's eternal form as spirit soul, part and parcel of the Lord, and completely reject the bogus material mentality. One who revives his original spiritual mentality becomes automatically detached from material attraction. Therefore, one should cultivate knowledge of the falsity of sense gratification. When the mind or senses are attracted to material enjoyment, the superior intelligence must immediately detect such illusion. In this way, one should purify one's mentality. By devotional service to the Lord, such detachment and intelligence automatically awaken, and by full understanding of one's original spiritual form, one is properly situated in eternal consciousness.</div>

<div class="Translation"> A person who has thus achieved Me by understanding that he is not different from Me realizes that the material mind is lodged within the sense objects because of constant sense gratification, and that the material objects are existing prominently within the material mind. Having understood My transcendental nature, he gives up both the material mind and its objects.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The Lord again states here that it is most difficult to separate the material mind from its objects because the material mind by definition considers itself to be the doer and enjoyer of everything. It must be understood that giving up the material mind does not mean giving up all mental activities, but instead means purifying the mind and engaging one's enlightened mentality in the devotional service of the Lord. Since time immemorial the material mind and senses have been in contact with the sense objects; therefore, how is it possible for the material mind to give up its objects, which are the basis of its existence? And not only does the mind reach out to material objects, but also, because of the mind's desires, the material objects cannot remain out of the mind, helplessly entering at every moment. Thus, separation between the mind and sense objects is not actually feasible, nor does it serve any purpose. If one retains a material mentality, considering oneself to be supreme, one may renounce sense gratification, considering it to be ultimately the cause of unhappiness, but one will not be able to remain on such an artificial platform, nor will such renunciation serve any real purpose. Without surrender to the lotus feet of the Lord, mere renunciation cannot take one out of this material world.</div>
<div class="First"> Just as the sun's rays are part of the sun, the living entities are part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When the living entity is completely absorbed in his identity as the part and parcel of the Personality of Godhead, he becomes actually wise and easily gives up the material mind and sense objects. The word mad-rüpaù in this verse indicates absorption of the mind in the form, qualities, pastimes and associates of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Immersed in such ecstatic meditation, one should render devotional service to the Lord, and this will automatically drive away the influence of sense gratification. By himself, the living entity does not have the potency to give up his false identification with the material mind and sense objects, but by worshiping the Lord in the mood of being His eternal part-and-parcel servant, one is infused with the Lord's potency, which easily drives away the darkness of ignorance.</div>

<div class="First"> "One should know that wakefulness is born of the mode of goodness, dreams from the mode of passion, and deep dreamless sleep from the mode of ignorance. The fourth element, pure consciousness, is different from these three and pervades them." (SB 11.25.20) Real freedom means säkñitvena, or to exist as a witness to the functions of illusion. Such an advantageous position is achieved by development of Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The spirit soul is trapped in the bondage of material intelligence, which awards him constant engagement in the illusory modes of nature. But I am the fourth stage of consciousness, beyond wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep. Becoming situated in Me, the soul should give up the bondage of material consciousness. At that time, the living entity will automatically renounce the material sense objects and the material mind.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa now specifically answers the questions that the sages originally placed before Lord Brahmä. Ultimately, the spirit soul has nothing to do with the material sense objects and modes of nature. But because of one's false identification with the material body, the modes of nature are empowered to engage one in illusory occupations. By destroying this false identification with matter, the soul gives up the illusory occupations awarded by the modes of nature. It is clearly stated in this verse that the living entity is not empowered to independently free himself from illusion, but must situate himself in Kåñëa consciousness, in full awareness of the Supreme Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Çrédhara Svämé comments as follows. "How does material existence cause the bondage of the living entity, and how can such bondage be given up? The Lord explains this here by the word ahaìkära-kåtam. Because of false ego, one is bound up in the network of illusion. Artha-viparyayam indicates that although the living entity desires blissful life, eternity and knowledge, he adopts procedures that actually cover over his eternal, blissful nature and give him exactly the opposite result. The living entity does not want death and suffering, but these are actually the results of material existence, which is therefore useless for all practical purposes. An intelligent person should contemplate the unhappiness of material life and thus become situated in the transcendental Lord. The word saàsära-cintäm can be understood as follows. Saàsära, or material existence, indicates material intelligence, because material existence only occurs because of the living entity's false intellectual identification with the material world. Because of this misidentification, one becomes overwhelmed with saàsära-cintäm, anxiety to enjoy the material world. One should become situated in the Lord and give up such useless anxiety."</div>

<div class="First"> One who is not Kåñëa conscious cannot understand that everything is resting within Lord Kåñëa, and thus it is impossible for him to retire from material sense gratification. One may adopt a particular process of salvation and consider oneself to be "saved"; nevertheless, his material conditioning will remain and thus he will maintain his attachment to the material world. While one is dreaming he sometimes imagines that he has awakened from a dream and is experiencing normal consciousness. Similarly, one may consider oneself to be saved, but if he remains absorbed in making material value judgements between good and bad, without reference to devotional service to the Supreme Lord, he is understood to be a conditioned soul covered by the illusory identification with matter.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura comments as follows: "Although Lord Kåñëa in His form of Haàsa-avatära has condemned the intelligence that sees duality and separate values within the material world, the Vedas themselves institute the system of varëäçrama-dharma, by which the entire human society is divided into different castes, occupations and spiritual statuses. Therefore, how can the Lord recommend that one give up one's faith in this Vedic system? The answer is given in this verse as follows. The words anyeñäà bhävänäm, or 'of other states of existence,' refer to the innumerable divisions of false identification with the material body, mind, occupation, and so on. Such identification is illusion, and the material divisions of the varëäçrama system are certainly based on this illusion. The Vedic literatures promise heavenly rewards such as residence in upper planetary systems and prescribe the means to acquire such rewards. However, both the rewards and the means for achieving them are ultimately illusion. Since this world is the Lord's creation, one cannot deny that its existence is also real; yet the living entity who identifies the creations of this world as belonging to himself is certainly in illusion. The example may be given that horns are real and rabbits are real, but if one imagines a rabbit's horns, that is certainly illusion, though a rabbit's horns may occur in a dream. Similarly, the living entity dreams of a permanent relationship within the material world. One may dream that one is feasting on sumptuous sweet rice prepared with milk and sugar, but there is no actual nutritional value in the dream of royal feasting."</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura remarks in this regard that just as one soon forgets the experience of a dream after awakening, similarly, a liberated soul in Kåñëa consciousness does not see anything substantial in even the most exalted rewards offered by the Vedas, such as promotion to the heavenly planets. Therefore Lord Kåñëa advised Arjuna in Bhagavad-gétä to remain fixed in self-realization, without being deviated by fruitive rituals performed in the name of religion.</div>

<div class="Translation"> While awake the living entity enjoys with all of his senses the fleeting characteristics of the material body and mind; while dreaming he enjoys similar experiences within the mind; and in deep dreamless sleep all such experiences merge into ignorance. By remembering and contemplating the succession of wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep, the living entity can understand that he is one throughout the three stages of consciousness and is transcendental. Thus, he becomes the lord of the senses.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In verse 30 of this chapter Lord Kåñëa stated that one must retire from material duality by the proper means, which the Lord now explains. One may first consider the three phases of consciousness mentioned above and then understand one's own transcendental position as spirit soul. One experiences childhood, boyhood, adolescence, adulthood, middle age and old age, and throughout these phases one is experiencing things while awake and while dreaming. Similarly, one may, by careful intelligence, understand one's lack of consciousness during deep sleep, and thus through intelligence one may have experience of lack of consciousness.</div>
<div class="First"> One may argue that it is actually the senses that experience during wakefulness and that it is the mind that experiences during dreams. However, the Lord here states, indriyeçaù: the living entity is actually the lord of the senses and mind, although temporarily he has become a victim of their influence. By Kåñëa consciousness one may resume one's rightful position as master of the mental and sensory faculties. Also, since the living entity can remember his experiences in these three stages of consciousness, he is ultimately the experiencing agent or the seer of all phases of consciousness. He remembers, "I saw so many things in my dream, and then my dream ended and I didn't see anything. Now I'm waking up." This universal experience can be understood by everyone, and thus everyone can understand that one's actual identity is separate from the material body and mind.</div>

They can be compared to the streaking red line created by whirling a fiery stick. The spirit soul by nature exists in the single state of pure consciousness. However, in this world he appears in many different forms and stages of existence. The modes of nature divide the soul's consciousness into normal wakefulness, dreaming and dreamless sleep.

Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura comments as follows. "The living entity, while living in the external energy of the Lord, should give up any anxiety for sense gratification and should not act for his personal enjoyment. Rather, one should search out spiritual bliss through devotional service to the Supreme Lord. By reviving one's relationship with Lord Kåñëa, one will understand that if one accepts any material object for one's personal enjoyment, attachment will inevitably develop, and thus one will be bewildered by illusion.

It is common knowledge that at mundane social gatherings men become drunk and lose all awareness of their external situation.

At that time the body will automatically die according to destiny. The following doubt may then arise: If a Kåñëa conscious person pays proper attention to the maintenance of the body, is there danger of again becoming attached to it? Lord Kåñëa here states that one who is highly elevated in Kåñëa consciousness, having understood Lord Kåñëa to be the actual vastu, or reality, never again surrenders to the illusory identification with the material body, which is just like the body seen in a dream.</div>

<div class="Translation"> All superior transcendental qualities, such as being beyond the modes of nature, detached, the well-wisher, the most dear, the Supersoul, equally situated everywhere, and free from material entanglement—all such qualities, free from the transformations of material qualities, find their shelter and worshipable object in Me.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Because in the previous verse Lord Kåñëa explained His exalted nature, the sons of Brahmä might have slightly doubted the Lord's position, thinking that they had detected some pride within the Lord's mind. Therefore, they may have doubted the instructions they had just received from Lord Haàsa. Anticipating any such reluctance, the Lord immediately clarifies the situation in the present verse. The Lord explains that, unlike ordinary living entities even up to the standard of Brahmä, the Lord's transcendental body is not different from His eternal Self and has no material qualities such as false egotism. The Lord's transcendental form is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss, and is thus nirguëam, beyond the modes of nature. Because the Lord completely ignores the so-called enjoyment offered by the illusory energy, He is called nirapekñakam, and being the best well-wisher of His devotees, He is called suhådam. Priyam indicates that the Lord is the supreme lovable object and that He establishes wonderful affectionate relationships with His devotees. Sämya indicates that the Lord is neutral and detached in all material situations. These and other exalted qualities find their shelter and worshipable object in the Lord, who does not take material designations into consideration but awards His mercy to anyone who takes shelter of Him. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.16.26-30) mother Bhümi, the predominating deity of the earth, gives a list of some of the Lord's transcendental qualities, and even more are found in The Nectar of Devotion. Actually, the Lord's qualities are unlimited, but a small sample is given here simply to establish the Lord's transcendental position.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted from the Käla-saàhitä as follows. "The demigods are not actually perfectly endowed with transcendental qualities. Indeed, their opulences are limited, and therefore they worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, who is simultaneously free of all material qualities and completely endowed with all transcendental qualities, which exist in His personal body."</div>

<div class="Chapnum"> 14. Lord Kåñëa Explains the Yoga System to Çré Uddhava</div>
<div class="First"> In this chapter, Kåñëa explains that devotional service to the Supreme Lord is the most excellent method of spiritual practice. He also speaks about the process of meditation.</div>
<div class="First"> Çré Uddhava wanted to know which process of spiritual advancement is the best. He also desired to hear about the superexcellence of devotional service free from ulterior motives. The Supreme Personality of Godhead replied to him that the original process of religion revealed in the Vedas had become lost during the time of annihilation. At the beginning of the new creation, therefore, the Supreme Lord spoke it again to Brahmä. Brahmä repeated it to Manu, Manu spoke it to the sages headed by Bhågu Muni, and these sages in turn instructed this eternal religion to the demigods and demons. Because of the living entities' multitude of diverse desires, this system of religion was elaborately explained in different ways. Thus different philosophies arose, including various atheistic doctrines. Because the living entity, bewildered by illusion, is incapable of ascertaining his eternal benefit, he mistakenly identifies ordinary vows of penance, austerity, etc., to be the topmost spiritual practice. But the only true means of achieving happiness is to meditate on offering everything to the Supreme Lord. In this way one becomes free from all desires for selfish gratification through enjoyment of mundane sense objects, and he becomes released from all hankering for either enjoyment or liberation. The Lord then proceeded to describe the superior process of devotional service, which destroys countless sinful reactions and produces many symptoms of spiritual happiness, such as the standing of the hairs on end. Pure devotion, having the power to purify the heart, enables one to achieve the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and because the devotee is very dear to the Lord and is always close to Him, he is able in turn to purify the entire universe. By virtue of his unflinching devotion to the Lord, the devotee can never be completely diverted by the objects of sense enjoyment, even if he is not able to gain control over his senses in the beginning. One desiring to attain the perfection of life is advised to give up all material processes of elevation as well as the association of women. He should then merge his mind constantly in thought of Lord Kåñëa. Finally, the Lord instructed Çré Uddhava about the true object of meditation.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In order to clearly establish the exalted position of bhakti-yoga, or pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord, Çré Uddhava requests Lord Kåñëa to identify the supreme among all processes of self-realization. Not all Vedic processes lead directly to the ultimate goal, pure love of God; some only gradually elevate the consciousness of the living entity. For the purpose of giving a general outline of the process of self-realization, sages may discuss the various methods of elevation. But when the time comes to ascertain the most perfect process, the secondary methods must be cleared from the path.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear Lord, You have clearly explained the process of unalloyed devotional service, by which a devotee removes all material association from his life, enabling him to fix his mind on You.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> It is now clearly established that pure devotional service is the supreme process for fixing the mind in the Supreme Truth, Lord Kåñëa. The next point to be clarified is this: Can everyone practice this process, or is it limited to an elite class of transcendentalists? In discussing the relative advantages of different spiritual processes, one must immediately ascertain the goal of spiritual life and then isolate the process that actually awards this goal. Processes must be defined in terms of primary and secondary functions. A method that gives one the highest perfection is primary, whereas processes that merely assist or enhance the primary function are considered secondary. The mind is most flickering and unsteady; therefore by clear intelligence one must fix oneself in a progressive mode of life, and thus one can achieve the Absolute Truth in this lifetime. This is the sober purpose of Lord Kåñëa's conversation with Çré Uddhava.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa explains to Uddhava that although many processes and concepts of spiritual realization are described in the Vedas, the Vedas ultimately recommend devotional service to the Supreme Lord. Lord Kåñëa is the reservoir of all pleasure, and His devotees directly enter into the Lord's hlädiné, or pleasure-giving, potency. Somehow or other one must fix one's mind in Lord Kåñëa, and that is not possible without devotional service. One who has not developed his attraction to Lord Kåñëa cannot restrain the senses from inferior engagements. Since other Vedic processes do not actually award Lord Kåñëa to the practitioner, they cannot offer the highest benefit in life. The transcendental sound of the Vedas is itself the highest evidence, but one whose senses and mind are entangled in sense gratification and mental speculation, and whose heart is therefore covered by material dust, cannot directly receive the transcendental Vedic message. Thus one cannot appreciate the exalted position of devotional service to the Lord.</div>

<div class="First"> Everyone engages in a certain way of life based on one's own nature and propensities. Bhakti-yoga is the natural activity of one whose nature is completely purified by association with the Supreme Lord. Other processes are meant for those whose nature is still affected by the material modes, and thus such processes, along with their results, are themselves also materially contaminated. Devotional service to the Lord, however, is a pure spiritual process, and by executing it with a pure consciousness one comes directly in touch with the Personality of Godhead, who describes Himself in Bhagavad-gétä (9.2) as pavitram idam uttamam, the supreme pure. The system of paramparä, or disciplic succession, is illustrated in this and the previous verse. The spiritual masters in Caitanya Mahäprabhu's movement are part of such a disciplic succession, and through them the same Vedic knowledge spoken by Brahmä to Manu is still available.</div>

<div class="Translation"> From the forefathers headed by Bhågu Muni and other sons of Brahmä appeared many children and descendants, who assumed different forms as demigods, demons, human beings, Guhyakas, Siddhas, Gandharvas, Vidyädharas, Cäraëas, Kindevas, Kinnaras, Nägas, Kimpuruñas, and so on. All of the many universal species, along with their respective leaders, appeared with different natures and desires generated from the three modes of material nature. Therefore, because of the different characteristics of the living entities within the universe, there are a great many Vedic rituals, mantras and rewards.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> If one is curious why Vedic literatures recommend so many different methods of worship and advancement, the answer is given here. Bhågu, Maréci, Atri, Aìgirä, Pulastya, Pulaha and Kratu are the seven great brähmaëa sages and forefathers of this universe. The Kindevas are a race of human beings who are, like the demigods, completely free from fatigue, sweat and body odor. Seeing them, one may thus ask, kià deväù: "Are they demigods?" Actually, they are human beings living on another planet within the universe. The Kinnaras are so called because they are kiïcin naräù, or "a little like human beings." The Kinnaras have either a human head or human body (but not both) combined with a nonhuman form. The Kimpuruñas are so called because they resemble human beings and thus prompt the question kià puruñäù: "Are these human beings?" Actually, they are a race of monkeys who are almost like human beings.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura explains that this verse describes the varieties of forgetfulness of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The different Vedic mantras and rituals are especially meant for the different species of intelligent beings throughout the universe; but this proliferation of Vedic formulas indicates only the variety of material illusion and not a variety of ultimate purpose. The ultimate purpose of the many Vedic injunctions is one—to know and love the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord Himself is emphatically explaining this to Çré Uddhava.</div>

(SB 4.31.12) According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, one enjoys the happiness spoken of in this verse while associating, in one's own spiritual body, with the supreme transcendental form of the Lord. The Lord's transcendental form is filled with infinite, wonderful qualities, and the happiness of being with the Lord is unlimited. Unfortunately, materialistic people cannot possibly imagine such happiness, since they are not at all inclined to love the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> A devotee who is always meditating upon Lord Kåñëa experiences transcendental sound, touch, form, flavor and aroma in the pastimes of the Lord. These sublime perceptions are certainly due to the causeless mercy of Lord Kåñëa upon one whose mind and senses are completely satisfied in Him. Such a person finds only happiness wherever he goes. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura gives the example that when a very wealthy man travels all over the world, at every place he stays he always enjoys the same luxurious standard of comfort. Similarly, one who has developed Kåñëa consciousness is never separated from happiness, because Lord Kåñëa is all-pervading. The word kiïcana indicates the so-called enjoyable things of this world. One who is akiïcana has correctly understood that material sense gratification is simply the glare of illusion, and therefore such a person is däntasya, or self-controlled, çäntasya, or peaceful, and mayä santuñöa-manasaù, or completely satisfied with his transcendental experience of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The position of the akiïcana pure devotee is described in this verse. Çré Priyavrata Mahäräja is an example of a great devotee who was not interested in universal sovereignty because his love was completely absorbed in the lotus feet of the Lord.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The Lord has described in the previous verses the unalloyed love of His pure devotees for Him, and now the Lord describes His love for His devotees. Ätma-yoni means Lord Brahmä, who is born directly from the Lord's body. Lord Çiva always gives great pleasure to Lord Kåñëa by his constant meditation upon Him, and Saìkarñaëa, or Balaräma, is the Lord's brother in kåñëa-lélä. The goddess of fortune is the Lord's wife, and the word ätmä here indicates the Lord's own self as the Deity. None of these personalities—even the Lord's own self—are as dear to Him as His pure devotee Uddhava, an akiïcana devotee of the Lord. Çréla Madhväcärya cites from Vedic literature the example that a gentleman sometimes neglects his own interest and that of his children to give charity to a poor beggar. Similarly, the Lord gives preference to a helpless devotee who depends completely on His mercy. The only way to obtain the Lord's mercy is through His causeless love, and the Lord is most lovingly inclined toward those devotees who are most dependent on Him, just as ordinary mothers and fathers worry more about their helpless children than about those who are self-sufficient. Thus even if one lacks any material qualification, one should simply depend upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without any other interest, and surely one will achieve the highest perfection of life.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Just as the devotees always follow the footsteps of Lord Kåñëa, similarly Lord Kåñëa, being a devotee of His devotees, follows the footsteps of His devotees. A pure servitor of the Lord is always meditating on the pastimes of the Lord and considering how to assist the Lord in His mission. All the material universes are situated in Çré Kåñëa's body, as demonstrated to Arjuna, mother Yaçodä and others. Lord Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore there is no question of impurity in the Lord. Still, the Lord desires to purify the universes situated within Him by taking the dust of the lotus feet of His pure devotees. Without the dust of the lotus feet of the devotees, it is not possible to engage in pure devotional service, without which one cannot directly experience transcendental bliss. Lord Kåñëa thought, "I have established this strict rule that one can enjoy My transcendental bliss only through devotional service obtained from the dust of the lotus feet of My devotees. Since I also desire to experience My own bliss, I will observe the standard procedure and accept the dust of My devotees' feet." Çréla Madhväcärya points out that Lord Kåñëa follows the footsteps of His devotees in order to purify them. As the Lord walks along behind His pure devotees, the wind blows the dust of the Lord's feet in the front of His devotees, who then become purified by contact with such transcendental dust. One should not foolishly look for material logic in these transcendental pastimes of the Lord. It is simply a question of love between the Lord and His devotees.</div>

<div class="First"> The pure devotees always experience transcendental bliss in their service to Çré Kåñëa, the reservoir of pleasure; thus they are completely detached from material pleasure and do not desire even liberation. Since all others have some personal desire, they cannot experience such happiness. Pure devotees always desire to give Kåñëa conscious happiness to all others, and therefore they are called mahäntaù, or great souls. In the course of a devotee's service, many opportunities for sense gratification arise, but a pure devotee is not tempted or attracted and does not fall down from his exalted transcendental position.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear Uddhava, if My devotee has not fully conquered his senses, he may be harassed by material desires, but because of his unflinching devotion for Me, he will not be defeated by sense gratification.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Abhibhüyate indicates falling down into the material world and being defeated by mäyä. But even though one's senses are not fully conquered, one who has unflinching devotion for Lord Kåñëa does not run the risk of being separated from Him. The words pragalbhayä bhaktyä indicate a person who has great devotion for Lord Kåñëa, and not one who desires to commit sinful activities and chant Hare Kåñëa to avoid the reaction. Because of previous bad habits and immaturity, even a sincere devotee may be harassed by lingering attraction to the bodily concept of life; but his unflinching devotion for Lord Kåñëa will act. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura gives the following two examples. A great warrior may be struck by the weapon of his enemy, but because of his courage and strength he is not killed or defeated. He accepts the blow and goes on to victory. Similarly, one may contract a serious disease, but if he takes the proper medicine he is quickly cured.</div>
<div class="First"> If those who follow the impersonal system of speculation and austerity deviate even slightly from their path, they fall down. A devotee, however, even though immature, never falls from the path of devotional service. Even if he displays occasional weakness, he is still considered a devotee if his devotion to Lord Kåñëa is very strong. As the Lord states in Bhagavad-gétä (9.30):</div>

<div class="First"> One should carefully note that the Lord refers to devotion that is like a blazing fire. To commit sinful activity on the strength of chanting the holy name is the greatest offense, and the devotion of one who commits this offense cannot be compared to a blazing fire of love for Kåñëa. As stated in the previous verse, a sincere loving devotee, because of immaturity or previous bad habits, may be disturbed by his senses even though he has accepted Lord Kåñëa as the only goal in his life. But if even by chance the devotee accidentally falls down without premeditation or indifference, the Lord immediately burns to ashes his sinful reactions, just as a blazing fire immediately consumes an insignificant piece of wood. Lord Kåñëa is glorious, and one who takes exclusive shelter of the Lord receives the unique benefits of devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="First"> One may make Kåñëa the goal of mystic yoga, Säìkhya philosophy, etc.; yet such activities do not please the Lord as much as direct loving service, which one practices by hearing and chanting about the Lord and executing His mission. Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé states, jïäna-karmädy-anävåtam: [Cc. Madhya 19.167] a devotee should simply depend on Kåñëa and should not unnecessarily complicate his loving service with tendencies toward fruitive work or mental speculation. The residents of Våndävana simply depend on Lord Kåñëa. When the great serpent Aghäsura appeared in the precincts of Vraja, the cowherd boys, completely confident in their friendship with Lord Kåñëa, fearlessly marched into the serpent's gigantic mouth. Such pure love for Kåñëa brings the Lord under the control of the devotee.</div>

However, even unfortunate persons who are taught from birth to engage in sinful activities can at once be purified by the potency of pure devotional service. Such service must have Lord Kåñëa as the only goal (man-niñöhä), must be rendered with full faith (çraddhayä), and must be unalloyed, or without any selfish motivation (ekayä).</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Although pious religious work, truthfulness, mercy, penances and knowledge partially purify one's existence, they do not take out the root of material desires. Thus the same desires will reappear at a later time. After an extensive program of material gratification, one becomes eager to perform austerities, acquire knowledge, perform selfless work and in general purify one's existence. After sufficient piety and purification, however, one again becomes eager for material enjoyment. When clearing an agricultural field one must uproot the unwanted plants, otherwise with the coming of rain everything will grow back as it was. Pure devotional service to the Lord uproots one's material desires, so that there is no danger of relapsing into a degraded life of material gratification. In the eternal kingdom of God, loving reciprocation between the Lord and His devotees is manifest. One who has not come to this stage of enlightenment must remain on the material platform, which is always full of discrepancies and contradictions. Thus everything is incomplete and imperfect without loving service to the Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Loving service to the Lord is the only process that can completely purify one's consciousness; such service produces waves of ecstatic love that completely cleanse the soul. As mentioned earlier by Lord Kåñëa to Çré Uddhava, other processes such as self-control, pious activities, mystic yoga, penances, etc., certainly purify the mind, as stated in many authorized literatures. Such processes, however, do not completely remove the desire to perform forbidden activities. But pure devotional service rendered in love of Godhead is so powerful that it burns to ashes any obstacle encountered on the path of progress. The Lord has stated in this chapter that loving service to Him is a blazing fire that burns to ashes all impediments. In contrast, the small fires of mental speculation or mystic yoga can be extinguished by sinful desires at any moment. Thus, by hearing Çrémad-Bhägavatam one should ignite the blazing fire of loving service to the Lord and burn to ashes the network of material illusion.</div>

<div class="First"> Väg gadgadä refers to a highly emotional state in which the throat is choked up and one cannot express oneself. Vilajjaù indicates that a devotee sometimes feels embarrassment due to bodily functions and memories of past sinful activities. In this condition, a devotee loudly cries out the holy name of Kåñëa and sometimes dances in ecstasy. As stated here, such a devotee purifies the three worlds.</div>
<div class="First"> By melting of the heart, one becomes very steady in spiritual life. Normally, one whose heart easily melts is thought to be unsteady; but because Lord Kåñëa is the stable foundation of all existence, one whose heart melts in love of Kåñëa becomes most stable and cannot be disturbed by opposing arguments, bodily suffering, mental problems, supernatural disasters or the interference of envious persons. Because such a devotee is fixed in loving service to the Lord, he becomes the very heart of the Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The Lord is called sükñmam because He is pure spiritual consciousness, without any tinge of material energy. If one chants and hears the holy name and glories of Kåñëa with great sincerity, there is immediately a transcendental effect. We can immediately see the spiritual world and pastimes of the Lord if we fully surrender to the process mentioned here. A blind person feels perpetual gratitude to a doctor who restores his sight. Similarly, we sing cakñu-däna dila ye, janme janme prabhu sei: the bona fide spiritual master, the representative of Lord Kåñëa, restores our spiritual sight, and thus he is our eternal lord and master.</div>

<div class="First"> One should not think that one can attain complete transcendental knowledge of Kåñëa by mechanically engaging in worship of the Lord. Lord Kåñëa states here that one must endeavor constantly to keep the Lord within one's mind. Anusmarataù, or constant remembrance, is possible for one who always chants and hears the glories of Lord Kåñëa. It is therefore stated, çravaëam, kértanam [SB 7.5.23], smaraëam: the process of devotional service begins with hearing (çravaëam) and chanting (kértanam), from which remembrance (smaraëam) develops. One who constantly thinks of the objects of material gratification becomes attached to them; similarly, one who constantly keeps Lord Kåñëa within his mind becomes absorbed in the Lord's transcendental nature and thus becomes qualified to render personal service to the Lord in His own abode.</div>

One who absorbs his consciousness in Kåñëa, however, attains to Kåñëa's nature and is therefore described as mad-bhäva-bhävitam, or one situated in real existence because of Kåñëa consciousness. The Lord here concludes His analysis of different processes of human perfection.</div>

Association with lusty men gives exactly the same result. Therefore, one is advised to be fearless and to sit down in a solitary place, or a place where there are no lusty men and women committing spiritual suicide. Without fear of failure or of unhappiness in life, one should remain with sincere devotees of the Lord. Atandrita means that one should not compromise this principle but should be rigid and cautious.

Association with lusty men is often more dangerous than association with women and should be avoided by all means. There are innumerable verses in the Bhägavatam describing the intoxication of material lust. Suffice it to say that a lusty man becomes exactly like a dancing dog and, by the influence of Cupid, loses all gravity, intelligence and direction in life. The Lord warns here that one who surrenders to the illusory form of a woman suffers unbearably in this life and the next.</div>

<div class="First"> It has already been elaborately explained by the Supreme Lord that without loving devotional service rendered to Him in the association of devotees, no other process of self-realization will work. Therefore it may be asked why Uddhava is again referring to the system of meditation, dhyäna. The äcäryas explain that one cannot fully appreciate the beauty and perfection of bhakti-yoga unless one sees its superiority to all other processes. Through comparative analysis, the devotees become fully ecstatic in their appreciation of bhakti-yoga. It should also be understood that although Uddhava asks about those who aspire for liberation, he is not actually a mumukñu, or salvationist; rather, he is asking questions for the benefit of those who are not on the platform of love of Godhead. Uddhava wants to hear this knowledge for his personal appreciation and so that those who pursue salvation, or liberation, can be protected and redirected to the path of pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord.</div>

All of the limbs of that beautiful form capture the heart, and the face is beautified by merciful glancing.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> As one becomes established in pure consciousness, the duality of "I am meditating and this is the object of my meditation" vanishes, and one comes to the stage of spontaneous relationship with the Personality of Godhead. Every living entity is originally part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, and when that forgotten eternal relationship is revived one experiences remembrance of the Absolute Truth. In that stage, described here as mad-ärohaù, one no longer sees oneself as a meditator nor the Lord as a mere object of meditation, but rather one enters the spiritual sky for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge in direct loving relationship with the Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> Uddhava originally inquired about the procedure of meditation for those desiring liberation. The word labdha-padam indicates that when one fixes the mind upon the Lord's face, one achieves full liberation. In the postliberation phase one then proceeds to render service to the original Personality of Godhead. By giving up the concept of being a meditator, one casts off the last small remnant of illusory energy and sees the Lord as He actually is.</div>

How happy everyone could be by taking to Kåñëa consciousness and finding the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, within everything and everything within Kåñëa.

<div class="First"> Because of false material identification, we accept our own body and mind, the bodies and minds of others, and supernatural material control to be ultimate realities. Supernatural control refers to the bodies and minds of the demigods, who ultimately are humble servitors of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even the mighty sun, which displays immense potencies, obediently treads its universal path by the order of Lord Kåñëa. It is clearly seen in this chapter that haöha-yoga, karma-yoga, räja-yoga, etc., are part and parcel of bhakti-yoga and do not actually exist separately. The goal of life is Lord Kåñëa, and one must eventually come to the stage of pure devotion if one desires to perfect one's meditation or yoga practice. In the mature stage of devotion, as described in this chapter, one becomes free from the artificial duality of meditator and object of meditation, and one spontaneously engages in hearing about and glorifying the Supreme Absolute Truth. Such activities of bhakti-yoga are natural because they spring from spontaneous love. When one revives one's original nature as the loving servitor of Lord Kåñëa, other yoga processes cease to be interesting. Uddhava was a pure devotee even before the Lord began His instruction; therefore it was not expected that Uddhava would give up the supreme platform of being a personal associate of the Lord to take up the mechanical exercises of the yoga system. Bhakti-yoga, or devotional service, is so elevated that even in the beginning stages of practice one is considered liberated, because all of one's activities are executed under proper guidance for the pleasure of the Lord. In the haöha-yoga system one is concerned with bodily control, and in jïäna-yoga one is concerned with speculative knowledge. In both systems one endeavors selfishly, desiring to become a great yogé or a philosopher. Such egoistic activity is described in this verse as kriyä. One must give up the illusory designations of dravya, jïäna and kriyä and come to the prideless stage of loving service to the Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Fourteenth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Lord Kåñëa Explains the Yoga System to Çré Uddhava."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 15. Lord Kåñëa's Description of Mystic Yoga Perfections</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter describes the eight primary and ten minor mystic perfections. They are developed by fixing one's mind in yoga, but they are ultimately obstructions to achieving the spiritual abode of Lord Viñëu. Being questioned by Uddhava, Lord Çré Kåñëa describes the characteristics of the eighteen mystic perfections and the particular kind of meditation by which each is achieved. In conclusion, Kåñëa states that for one who desires to perform pure devotional service to the Personality of Godhead, the achievement of these mystic perfections is a waste of time, because they distract one from proper worship. All these perfections are automatically offered to a pure devotee, but he does not accept them. Unless used in the yoga of devotional service, these perfections are valueless. A devotee simply sees that the Personality of Godhead is always present everywhere, both externally and internally, and depends completely upon Him.</div>

<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains the word mat pradhänäù as follows. Lord Kåñëa is naturally the shelter of the eight primary mystic potencies and meditations because such perfections emanate from the Lord's personal potency, and thus they are fully developed only within the Lord Himself and the Lord's personal associates. When materialistic persons mechanically acquire such potencies, the perfections awarded are of an inferior degree and are considered to be manifestations of mäyä, illusion. A pure devotee of the Lord automatically receives from the Lord wonderful potencies to execute his devotional service. If for sense gratification one mechanically endeavors to acquire mystic perfections, then these perfections are certainly considered to be inferior expansions of the Lord's external potency.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Among the eight primary mystic perfections, the three by which one transforms one's own body are aëimä, becoming smaller than the smallest; mahimä, becoming greater than the greatest; and laghimä, becoming lighter than the lightest. Through the perfection of präpti one acquires whatever one desires, and through präkämya-siddhi one experiences any enjoyable object, either in this world or the next. Through içitä-siddhi one can manipulate the subpotencies of mäyä, and through the controlling potency called vaçitä-siddhi one is unimpeded by the three modes of nature. One who has acquired kämävasäyitä-siddhi can obtain anything from anywhere, to the highest possible limit. My dear gentle Uddhava, these eight mystic perfections are considered to be naturally existing and unexcelled within this world.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Through aëimä-siddhi one can become so small that one can enter a stone or pass through any obstacle. Through mahimä-siddhi one becomes so great that one covers everything, and through laghimä one becomes so light that one can ride on the sun's rays into the sun planet. Through präpti-siddhi one can acquire anything from anywhere and can even touch the moon with one's finger. By this mystic perfection one can also enter into the senses of any other living entity through the predominating deities of the particular senses; and by thus utilizing the senses of others, one can acquire anything. Through präkämya one can experience any enjoyable object, either in this world or the next, and through éçitä, or the controlling potency, one can manipulate the subpotencies of mäyä, which are material. In other words, even by acquiring mystic powers one cannot pass beyond the control of illusion; however, one may manipulate the subpotencies of illusion. Through vaçitä, or the power to control, one can bring others under one's dominion or keep oneself beyond the control of the three modes of nature. Ultimately, one acquires through kämävasäyitä the maximum powers of control, acquisition and enjoyment. The word autpattikäù in this verse indicates being original, natural and unexcelled. These eight mystic potencies originally exist in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, in the superlative degree. Lord Kåñëa becomes so small that He enters within the atomic particles, and He becomes so large that as Mahä-Viñëu He breathes out millions of universes. The Lord can become so light or subtle that even great mystic yogés cannot perceive Him, and the Lord's acquisitive power is perfect, because He keeps the total existence eternally within His body. The Lord certainly can enjoy whatever He likes, control all energies, dominate all other persons and exhibit complete omnipotency. Therefore it is to be understood that these eight mystic perfections are insignificant expansions of the mystic potency of the Lord, who in Bhagavad-gétä is called Yogeçvara, the Supreme Lord of all mystic potencies. These eight perfections are not artificial, but are natural and unexcelled because they originally exist in the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> There are innumerable verses in Vedic literatures explaining that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is qualitatively not different from His creation and thus a yogé may meditate upon the total material existence as a manifestation of the external potency of the Lord. Once the yogé has established his realization that the material creation is not different from the Lord, he obtains the perfection called mahimä-siddhi. By realizing the Lord's presence in each individual element the yogé also acquires the greatness of each element. However, the pure devotees are not very interested in such perfections because they are surrendered to the Personality of Godhead, who exhibits such perfections to the infinite degree. Being always protected by the Lord, the pure devotees save their precious time to chant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. Thus they achieve for themselves and others saàsiddhi, or the supreme perfection, pure love of Godhead, Kåñëa consciousness, by which one expands one's existence beyond the total material creation to the spiritual planets called Vaikuëöha.</div>

<div class="First"> Çrémad-Bhägavatam elaborately explains that käla, or time, is the transcendental form of the Lord that moves the material world. Since the five gross elements are composed of atoms, the atomic particles are the subtle substance or manifestation of the movements of time. More subtle than time is the Personality of Godhead Himself, who expands His potency as the time factor. By understanding all these things clearly the yogé obtains laghimä-siddhi, or the power to make himself lighter than the lightest.</div>

Avyakta-janmanaù indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears from the avyakta, or the spiritual sky, or that His birth is avyakta, beyond the perception of material senses.

Thus the Lord is called turéya, or the fourth factor beyond the three modes of nature. According to Çréla Véraräghava Äcärya, turéya also indicates that the Lord is beyond the three ordinary phases of consciousness, namely wakefulness, dreaming and dreamless sleep. Bhaga-vac-chabda-çabdite indicates that the Lord is known as Bhagavän, or the possessor of unlimited opulences, principally beauty, fame, wealth, knowledge, renunciation and intelligence. In conclusion, one can obtain the mystic opulence vaçitä, or freedom from the modes of nature, by meditating upon the Lord as turéya, the fourth factor beyond those modes. Everything depends upon the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

One who meditates on the Supreme Lord as the personified sky and air thereby acquires the ability to hear that which is vibrated at great distance. The word präëa indicates that the Lord is the personified life air of the individual living entities and for the total aggregate of life forms. Ultimately, the pure devotees meditate on the supreme vibration—Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare—and are thus able to hear the speech originating from liberated living entities far beyond the material universe. Any living entity can hear such discussions by reading Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Bhagavad-gétä and other such literatures. One who has properly understood the opulences of the Supreme Personality of Godhead finds all perfection, mystic and otherwise, in Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

One may admire a heroic man or beautiful woman and desire to experience life within their extraordinary material body. Such opportunities are available through the mystic perfection called para-käya-praveçanam. Pure devotees, being absorbed in meditation upon the spiritual form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are not actually attracted to any material body.

<div class="First"> In this verse the word yadä ("whenever") indicates that by the mystic power called yathä-saìkalpa-saàsiddhi one will achieve one's objective even if one pursues it at an inauspicious time. Lord Kåñëa is called satya-saìkalpa, or He whose desire, intention, purpose or resolve always comes to pass. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura mentions that one should determine to revive one's lost relationship with the Supreme Lord Kåñëa through the infallible means of devotional service, which can be executed at any time or in any place. There are many books giving proper guidance for achieving Lord Kåñëa, and the following are mentioned: Çréla Jéva Gosvämé's Saìkalpa-kalpavåkña, Çréla Kåñëadäsa Kaviräja's Çré Govinda-lélämåta, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté's Çré Kåñëa-bhävanämåta and Saìkalpa-kalpadruma, and Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura's Çré Gauräìga-smaraëa-maìgala. In the modern age, His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda has given us over sixty large volumes of transcendental literature, which can fix us firmly on the path back home, back to Godhead. Our saìkalpa, or determination, should be practical and not useless. We should resolve to make a permanent solution to the problems of life by going back home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="First"> The creatures dwelling in the ocean are never injured by water; rather, they enjoy life within the watery medium. Similarly, for one skilled in the techniques of yoga, fending off attacks by weapons, fire, poison, and so on, is a recreational activity. Prahläda Mahäräja was attacked by his father in all these ways, but because of his perfect Kåñëa consciousness he was not injured. The pure devotees of the Lord depend fully on the mercy of Lord Kåñëa, who possesses mystic opulences to an infinite degree and is therefore known as Yogeçvara, the master of all mystic power. Because devotees are always connected to Lord Kåñëa, they do not feel any need to separately develop powers already possessed unlimitedly by their Lord, master and protector. If a human being falls into the middle of the ocean he quickly drowns, whereas the fish enjoy happiness sporting in the same waves. Similarly, the conditioned souls have fallen into the ocean of material existence and are drowning in the reactions to their sinful activities, whereas the devotees recognize this world to be the potency of the Lord and enjoy pleasurable pastimes within it by fully engaging in the loving service of Lord Kåñëa.</div>

<div class="First"> It is common sense that whatever is a useless waste of time should be given up; therefore one should not pray to God for mystic yoga perfections. For a pure devotee, who has no material desire, even impersonal liberation is a useless disturbance in his life, and what to speak of the material perfections of yoga, which cannot even be compared to impersonal liberation. Such mystic perfections may be wonderful for an immature and inexperienced person, but they are not impressive for a learned man who has understood the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Simply by obtaining Lord Kåñëa one dwells within an infinite ocean of mystic opulences; therefore he should not waste precious time pursuing separate mystic perfections.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> By taking birth as a demigod one is automatically endowed with many mystic perfections. Simply by birth on Siddhaloka one automatically acquires all of the eight principal perfections of yoga. Similarly, by birth as a fish one becomes invulnerable to water, by birth as a bird one gets the mystic perfection of flying, and by birth as a ghost one gets the mystic perfection of disappearing and entering into the bodies of others. Pataïjali Muni states that the mystic perfections of yoga can be achieved by birth, herbs, austerities and mantras. The Lord states, however, that such perfections are ultimately a waste of time and an impediment to achieving the actual perfection of yoga, Kåñëa consciousness.</div>
<div class="First"> Those who give up the process of bhakti-yoga and shop around for other objects of meditation besides Kåñëa are certainly not very intelligent. Those who claim to be yogés but pursue the satisfaction of their own senses are certainly kuyogés, or bhogi-yogés. Such kuyogés cannot understand that just as they have tiny senses, the Absolute Truth has absolute senses, nor can they understand that yoga is actually meant to satisfy the absolute senses of the Lord. Therefore, persons who give up the lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa in order to pursue so-called happiness in mystic perfection will undoubtedly be frustrated in their attempt. By meditating exclusively on the Supreme Personality of Godhead one can achieve yoga-gati, the ultimate goal of yoga, which means living on Lord Kåñëa's planet and there enjoying spiritual opulences.</div>

<div class="First"> According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, the word yoga here indicates liberation from material life, and säìkhya indicates the means of obtaining liberation. Thus Lord Kåñëa is not merely the Lord of material yoga perfections, but of the highest liberated perfections as well. One can obtain säìkhya, or knowledge leading to liberation, by performing pious activities, and Lord Kåñëa is also the cause, protector and Lord of such activities as well as of the learned teachers who instruct ordinary people in the means of piety. In many different ways Lord Kåñëa is the real object of meditation and worship for every living entity. Lord Kåñëa through the expansion of His potencies is everything, and this simple understanding, called Kåñëa consciousness, is the supreme perfection of the yoga system.</div>

<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa is the entire basis of meditation for all yogés and philosophers, and here the Lord clarifies His absolute position. Since the Lord is within everything, one might think that the Lord is divided into pieces. However, the word anävåta, or "completely uncovered," indicates that nothing can interrupt, disturb or in any way infringe upon the supreme existence of the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. There is no actual separation between the internal and external existence of the material elements, which continuously exist everywhere. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is all-pervading and is the ultimate perfection of everything. Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Fifteenth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Lord Kåñëa's Description of Mystic Yoga Perfections."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 16. The Lord's Opulence</div>
<div class="First"> In this chapter the Personality of Godhead, Lord Çré Kåñëa, describes His manifest opulences in terms of His specific potencies of knowledge, strength, influence, and so on.</div>
<div class="First"> Çré Uddhava offered glorification to Lord Çré Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead and ultimate shelter of all holy places, saying, "The Supreme Lord has no beginning and no end. He is the cause of the birth, maintenance and destruction of all living entities. He is the soul of all beings, and by secretly taking up residence within all living bodies He sees everything. The conditioned souls, on the other hand, are bewildered by His external energy and thus are unable to see Him." After offering such prayers at the lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa, Çré Uddhava revealed his desire to know about the Lord's various opulences in heaven, on earth, in hell and in all directions. Lord Çré Kåñëa then described all these opulences, after which He commented that all power, beauty, fame, opulence, humility, charity, charm, good fortune, valor, tolerance and wisdom-wherever they are manifest-are simply expansions from Himself. It therefore cannot be truthfully said that a material object actually possesses these opulences. Such conceptions are the results of mentally combining two ideas to produce an object that exists only in the imagination, such as a sky flower. Material opulences are not substantially true, and therefore one should not become too involved in meditating upon them. The pure devotees of the Supreme Lord utilize their intelligence to properly regulate the activities of their speech, mind and vital force and thus perfect their existence in Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Brahma means the greatest of all and the cause of everything. Uddhava here addresses the Lord as the paramam, or supreme brahma, because in His feature as Bhagavän the Lord is the highest feature of the Absolute Truth and the shelter of unlimited spiritual opulences. Unlike those of ordinary living entities, the Lord's opulences cannot be restricted by time, and thus the Lord is anädy-antam, without beginning or end, and apävåtam, unhindered by any superior or equal potency. The opulence of the material world is also resting within the Lord, who alone can protect, maintain, create and destroy the material world. In this chapter, Çré Uddhava inquires from the Lord about His spiritual and material opulences in order to refine his appreciation of the Lord's position as the Absolute Truth. Even Lord Viñëu, the ultimate creator of the material world, is an expansion of Lord Kåñëa, and thus Çré Uddhava wishes to fully appreciate the unique status of his personal friend.</div>

<div class="First"> The behavior of saintly persons is also to be taken as evidence, and therefore it is here stated that although ignorant, impious persons are bewildered before the Lord's all-pervading feature, those with purified, clear consciousness worship the Lord as He is. In this chapter çré Uddhava inquires about the Lord's opulences, and here the words uccävaceñu bhüteñu ("within superior and inferior creations") clearly refer to the Lord's external opulences, those manifested in the material world. The saintly brähmaëas, or Vaiñëavas, worship Lord Kåñëa within all things and yet recognize the variety in the Lord's creation. For example, in worshiping the Deity, the devotees will select the nicest flowers, fruits and ornaments for decorating the transcendental form of the Lord. Similarly, although the Lord is present in the heart of every conditioned soul, the devotee will give more attention to a conditioned soul interested in the message of Lord Kåñëa. Although the Lord is everywhere, the devotees make distinctions, for the sake of the Lord's service, between His presence in superior (ucca) and inferior (avaceñu) creations.</div>

<div class="First"> The Lord exists as the Supersoul within everything. He also appears in various incarnations or sometimes empowers a devotee to act as an incarnation. All such forms of the Lord are unknown to the nondevotees. The bewildered conditioned souls think that the supreme enjoyer, Çré Kåñëa, is actually meant to be enjoyed by them for their sense gratification. Praying to God for specific material benedictions and assuming God's creation to be their personal property, the nondevotees cannot understand the actual form of the Lord. They therefore remain foolish and bewildered. Within the universe everything is subject to creation, maintenance and destruction, and thus the Supersoul is the only actual controller in the material world. Unfortunately, when the Supersoul appears in various incarnations to clarify His position, ignorant persons think that the Supersoul is merely another creation of the modes of material nature. As stated in this verse, they cannot see that person who is actually seeing them, and simply remain bewildered.</div>

For the appreciation of ordinary human beings Uddhava requests the Lord to reveal exactly how and in what forms He expands His potencies. As already explained, the Lord is the essential ingredient of all that exists, and thus any mighty or opulent manifestation must ultimately rest on the Lord Himself.</div>

Among all speculative philosophers I am diversity of perception.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Any science is based on the faculty of expert discrimination. By skillful definition of isolated and interactive components one becomes expert in any field. Ultimately the most intelligent person can isolate the spirit soul from matter and describe the properties of matter and spirit as both isolated and interactive components of reality. The proliferation of innumerable philosophical speculations is due to differing modes of perception within the material world. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (15.15), sarvasya cähaà hådi sanniviñöo mattaù småtir jïänam apohanaà ca: the Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in everyone's heart and awards a particular degree of knowledge or ignorance according to one's desire and merit. Thus the Lord Himself is the basis of the mundane process of philosophical speculation, for He creates differing and alternating modes of perception within the conditioned souls. It is to be understood that one can acquire perfect knowledge only by hearing directly from Lord Kåñëa and not by hearing from conditioned philosophers who imperfectly perceive the creation of the Lord through the screen of their personal desires.</div>

Certainly fear is one of the great miseries of material life; therefore the gift of fearlessness is very valuable and represents Lord Kåñëa. Both in ordinary pleasant speech and silence, very few confidential things are revealed, and thus diplomacy and silence are both aids to secrecy. Lord Brahmä is prominent among sexual pairs because the original beautiful couple, Sväyambhuva Manu and Çatarüpä, emerged from Lord Brahmä's body, as explained in Chapter Twelve of the Third Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam.</div>

Although many great personalities are sometimes called Bhagavän, ultimately Bhagavän is the one supreme entity who possesses unlimited opulences. Throughout history, many important personalities have been addressed as "lord," but ultimately there is only one Supreme Lord.

Mahäräja Parékñit constructed a sitting place from kuça grass during the last week of his life. Among beautiful things the lotus cup formed by lotus petals represents Lord Kåñëa, and among jewels the ruby, which is similar to Lord Kåñëa's own Kaustubha gem, symbolizes the potency of the Lord.</div>

<div class="First"> Without the manifestation of the mahat-tattva, or total material existence, and the jéva, or living entity, nothing can exist within the material world. Everything we experience is a combination of the living entity and matter, in its various subtle and gross categories. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the entire basis of the existence of both the living entity and matter. Nothing can possibly exist even for a moment without the mercy of the Supreme Lord. One should not foolishly conclude that the Lord is therefore material. As has been clearly explained in this canto of the Bhägavatam, both the living entity and the Supreme Lord are completely transcendental to material nature. The living entity, however, has the propensity to dream that he is material, whereas the Lord constantly remembers the transcendental position of both Himself and the conditioned dreaming entity. As the Lord is transcendental, His abode is also far beyond the reach of the modes of nature. The actual purpose of life is to understand by mature conviction the transcendental Lord, His transcendental abode, our own transcendental position and the process by which we may go back home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation"> I have briefly described to you all My spiritual opulences and also the extraordinary material features of My creation, which are perceived by the mind and defined in different ways according to circumstances.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Sanskrit grammar, and as confirmed by Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, the words etäù and ete describe two distinct sets of the Lord's opulences. The Lord has described His opulent plenary expansions, such as Väsudeva, Näräyaëa, the Supersoul, etc., and further the Lord has described the outstanding features of the material creation, which are also included among the glories of the Personality of Godhead. The plenary manifestations of the Lord, such as Väsudeva, Näräyaëa, etc., are all eternal, unchanging transcendental features of the Lord and are indicated by the term etäù. The extraordinary aspects of material creation, however, are circumstantial and dependent on individual perception, and they are therefore described here by the words mano-vikärä evaite yathä väcäbhidhéyate. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains that by consistent logical application of synonyms, etäù refers to the Lord's eternal spiritual manifestations, beyond the perception of the material senses, whereas ete refers to those opulences that can be perceived by conditioned souls. He gives the example that the paraphernalia and intimate associates of a king are all considered to be part and parcel of the king and are therefore granted royal status. Similarly, the opulent features of material creation are reflected expansions of the Lord's personal opulences and thus may be considered nondifferent from Him. One should not, however, wrongly assume that such insignificant material opulences occupy the same status as the Lord's plenary features as the Personality of Godhead, which are qualitatively and quantitatively equal to the Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura comments as follows on this verse. "The Lord's external opulences are called mano-vikäräù, or 'related to mental transformation,' because ordinary people perceive extraordinary features of the material world according to their personal state of mind. Thus the word väcäbhidhéyate indicates that conditioned souls describe the Lord's material creation according to specific material circumstances. Because of the circumstantial relative definitions of material opulence, such opulence is never to be considered a direct plenary manifestation of the Lord's personal form. When one's state of mind is transformed into a favorable or affectionate state, one defines a manifestation of the Lord's energy as 'my son,' 'my father,' 'my husband,' 'my uncle,' 'the son of my brother,' 'my friend,' and so on. One forgets that every living entity is actually part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that whatever opulences, talents or outstanding features one may exhibit are actually the potencies of the Lord. Similarly, when the mind is transformed into a negative or inimical state, one thinks, 'This person will be the ruin of me,' 'This person must be finished by me,' 'He is my enemy' or 'I am his enemy,' 'He is a killer, or 'He should be killed.' The negative state of mind is also expressed when one is attracted to the extraordinary material aspects of particular persons or objects but forgets that they are manifestations of the potency of the Personality of Godhead. Even the demigod Indra, who is quite obviously a manifestation of the Lord's material opulences, is misunderstood by others. For example, Indra's wife, Çacé, thinks that Indra is 'my husband,' whereas Aditi thinks that he is 'my son.' Jayanta thinks that he is 'my father,' Båhaspati thinks that he is 'my disciple,' whereas the demons feel that Indra is their personal enemy. Thus different personalities define him according to their mental state. The Lord's material opulences, being relatively perceived, are therefore called mano-vikära, which means they are dependent on mental states. This relative perception is material because it does not recognize the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the actual source of the particular opulence. If one sees Lord Kåñëa as the source of all opulences and gives up all desires to enjoy or possess the Lord's opulences, then one can see the spiritual nature of these opulences. At that time, even though one may continue to perceive the variety and distinctions of the material world, one will become perfect in Kåñëa consciousness. One should not conclude, as do the voidist philosophers, that the Lord's spiritual manifestations in the viñëu-tattva and liberated jéva categories are also products of relative perception and mental states. This useless idea is contrary to the entire body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's teachings to Çré Uddhava."</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the word väcä also indicates the various Vedic literatures that describe the particular processes by which the Lord manifests His spiritual and material opulences, and in this context yathä indicates the specific procedures of manifestation and creation.</div>

<div class="First"> One should see all things as expansions of the Supreme Lord's potency, and thus with speech, mind and words one should offer respect to all things, without minimizing any living entity or material object. Since everything belongs to the Lord, everything ultimately should be engaged in the Lord's service with great care. A self-realized devotee tolerates personal insult and does not become envious of any living entity, nor does he see anyone as his enemy. This is practical enlightenment. Although a pure devotee may criticize those who obstruct the Lord's mission, such criticism is never personally motivated nor is it ever based on enviousness. An advanced devotee of the Lord may chastise his followers or criticize the demoniac, but only to carry out the mission of the Supreme Lord and never out of personal enmity or enviousness. For one who completely gives up the material concept of life there is no possibility of entering again onto the path of birth and death.</div>

<div class="First"> Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Sixteenth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Lord's Opulence."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 17. Lord Kåñëa's Description of the Varëäçrama System</div>
<div class="First"> Previously, the Supreme Lord, Çré Kåñëa, had assumed the form of Haàsa and glorified the duties of the brahmacäré and gåhastha orders. In this present chapter Lord Kåñëa further describes these matters to Uddhava. After Uddhava inquires from Çré Kåñëa about the duties of the social and religious orders of the varëäçrama society, the Lord replies that in the first age, Satya-yuga, there was only one social order, called haàsa. In that age men were automatically dedicated to pure devotional service from their very birth, and since everyone was perfect in-all respects, the age was called Kåta-yuga. The Vedas were then manifest in the form of the sacred syllable oà, and the Supreme Lord was perceived within the mind in the form of the four-legged bull of religion. There were no formalized processes of sacrifice, and the sinless people, who were naturally inclined to austerity, simply engaged in meditation on the personal form of the Lord. In the following age, Tretä-yuga, there became manifest from the heart of the Supreme Personality of Godhead the three Vedas, and from them the three forms of the sacrificial fire. At that time the system of four varëas and four äçramas, which prescribes material and spiritual duties for the different members of society, appeared from the bodily limbs of the Lord. According to how the social divisions took birth from higher and lower features of the Lord's body, they became endowed with higher and lower qualities. After this description, Lord Kåñëa explains the natures of persons in each of the four varëas and of those who are outside the limits of the varëas. He also describes those qualities that pertain to humanity in general.</div>
<div class="First"> Members of the higher orders are qualified to accept second birth. After receiving the sacred thread initiation, they should go to live in the guru-kula, the home of the spiritual master. With a pacified mind, the student (brahmacäré) should absorb himself in study of the Vedas. He should keep matted hair and is forbidden to wash his teeth, prepare a nice seat for himself, talk when bathing or evacuating, cut his hair and nails or at any time pass semen. He must regularly perform worship at the three junctures of the day and must render devotional service to his spiritual master in a spirit free from envy. The brahmacäré must offer to the guru whatever food and other things he obtains by begging. He accepts for his maintenance whatever remnants of the Lord he is granted. He should render menial service to the spiritual master by massaging his feet and worshiping him and should avoid all sense gratification and strictly maintain the vow of celibacy. With his mind, body and words, he should worship the Supreme Lord in the form of the Supersoul in the way prescribed for him. For brahmacärés, seeing or touching women, and conversations or sports in the company of women, are absolutely disallowed. Cleanliness and ritual purification by water should be observed by members of all the spiritual orders of society. Everyone is also advised to always remember that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Supreme Soul dwelling within the hearts of all.</div>
<div class="First"> After studying all the different aspects of the Vedas, a brähmaëa who has material desires may take permission from his spiritual master and enter family life. Otherwise, if he has no material desire, he may become a vänaprastha or sannyäsé. The proper order of succession should be followed in changing from one spiritual order to the next. One who wishes to enter the household order should accept a wife who is of the same social class, who is not objectionable, and who is somewhat younger in age than he.</div>
<div class="First"> The obligatory duties of the three classes who are twice-born-the brähmaëas, kñatriyas and vaiçyas-are worship of the Lord, study of the Vedas and giving charity. The occupational duties of accepting charity, teaching others and performing sacrifice for others are the privilege of the brähmaëas alone. If a brähmaëa considers that his consciousness is contaminated by engaging in these occupations, he may sustain his existence by collecting grains from the fields. If he is disturbed by poverty, the brähmaëa may out of necessity accept the business of a kñatriya or vaiçya, but he should never take the occupation of a çüdra. In a similar situation, a kñatriya may take the occupation of a vaiçya, and a vaiçya that of a çüdra. But when the emergency has passed, it is not fitting to continue earning one's living by a lower occupation. A brähmaëa who is properly fixed in his personal duty rejects all insignificant material desires, always serves the Vaiñëavas and is under the protection of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The householder should study the Vedas every day and maintain his wards with money honestly earned by his own occupation. As far as possible, he should execute worship of the Lord by ritual sacrifices. Remaining unattached to material life and fixed in devotion to the Supreme Lord, the householder may finally take the order of vänaprastha, so that he can fully involve himself in the Lord's worship. If he has a grown son, he may directly take the renounced order of sannyäsa. But persons who are excessively lusty after women, who have no proper discrimination, and who are extremely attached to wealth and possessions remain perpetually in anxiety over the welfare of their family members and are doomed to take their next birth in a lower species of life.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa has already elaborately explained the process of jïäna-yoga, bhakti-yoga and añöäìga-yoga. Now Uddhava inquires how those inclined toward karma-yoga can achieve the perfection of life, Kåñëa consciousness. In Bhagavad-gétä (4.13) Lord Kåñëa describes that He is personally the creator of the varëäçrama system. Cätur-varëyaà mayä såñöaà guëa-karma-vibhägaçaù. Therefore the ultimate goal of the varëäçrama system is to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, one should become a devotee of the Lord and learn the process of pure devotional service. The easiest method of achieving pure devotional service is by the association of pure devotees of the Lord. If one submissively and faithfully associates with pure devotees, one can immediately achieve the perfection of life. A Kåñëa conscious person is not required to execute all the formalities of the varëäçrama system, because a Kåñëa conscious person, absorbed in love of Godhead, automatically gives up all sense gratification and mental speculation. Those human beings who do not follow the varëäçrama system are here referred to as dvi-padäm, or two-legged. In other words, one who does not follow the religious path of life is known to be human only by the possession of two legs. Even ordinary animals and insects are eagerly engaged in eating, sleeping, mating and defending; the human being, however, is distinguished from such lower forms of life by his capacity to become religious and, ultimately, to love God in pure Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

The process that awards the highest perfection of life should be considered the most auspicious for human beings. The varëäçrama system is the most scientific presentation of religiosity on the earth, and those who are most perfect in that system come to the point of Kåñëa consciousness, or dedicating everything for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> In the beginning, in Satya-yuga, there is only one social class, called haàsa, to which all human beings belong. In that age all people are unalloyed devotees of the Lord from birth, and thus learned scholars call this first age Kåta-yuga, or the age in which all religious duties are perfectly fulfilled.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> It is understood from this verse that the supreme religious principle is unalloyed surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Satya-yuga there is no influence of the lower modes of nature, and therefore all human beings belong to the highest social order, called haàsa, in which one comes under the direct supervision of the Personality of Godhead. In the modern age people are crying out for social equality, but unless all human beings are situated in the mode of goodness, which is the position of purity and unalloyed devotion, social equality is not possible. As the lower modes of nature become prominent, secondary religious principles arise, by which people may be gradually elevated to the pure stage of unalloyed surrender to God. In Satya-yuga there are no inferior human beings, and thus there is no need of secondary religious principles. Everyone directly takes to the unalloyed service of the Lord, fulfilling perfectly all religious obligations. In Sanskrit, one who perfectly executes all duties is called kåta-kåtya, as mentioned in this verse. Therefore Satya-yuga is called Kåta-yuga, or the age of perfect religious action. According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the word ädau ("in the beginning") refers to the moment of universal creation. In other words, the varëäçrama system is not a recent concoction but naturally arises at the time of creation and should therefore be accepted by all intelligent human beings.</div>

Çré Vyäsadeva divided the one Veda into four—the Åg, Yajur, Säma and Atharva Vedas—at the end of Dväpara-yuga, but in Satya-yuga the whole of Vedic knowledge is easily understood by everyone simply by vibrating the syllable oà. In this age there are no ritualistic or pious activities such as sacrifice, since everyone is sinless, austere and fully engaged in worshiping the Personality of Godhead, Lord Haàsa, through the process of meditation.</div>

<div class="First"> In Tretä-yuga, the bull of religion loses one leg, and only seventy-five percent of religious principles are manifested, represented by the three principal Vedas—Åg, Säma and Yajur. The Lord appears in the process of threefold Vedic sacrifice. The three divisions are understood as follows. The hotä priest offers oblations into the fire and chants the Åg Veda; the udgätä priest chants the Säma Veda; and the adhvaryu priest, who arranges the sacrificial ground, altar, etc., chants the Yajur Veda. In Tretä-yuga such sacrifice is the authorized process for spiritual perfection. The word präëät in this verse refers to the universal form of the Personality of Godhead.

A living entity is born with a certain amount of intelligence, beauty and social opportunity, and he is therefore situated in a particular occupational and social position within the varëäçrama system. Ultimately, such positions are external designations, but since the majority of human beings are conditioned by the external energy of the Lord, they should act according to the scientific varëäçrama divisions until they reach the stage of jévan-mukta, or liberated life.</div>

On the other hand, he is däna-niñöha, or dedicated to charitable work; brahmasevé, always engaged in assisting the brähmaëas; and adambha, free from hypocrisy. This is due to ästikyam, or complete faith in the Vedic way of life, and confidence that one will be rewarded or punished in the next life for one's present activities. The fervent desire of the vaiçyas to accumulate wealth is not the same as ordinary material greed, because it is purified and tempered by the superior qualities mentioned in this verse.</div>

<div class="First"> Here the Lord describes those who reside outside the scientific social system called varëäçrama. In Europe and America, we have practically observed that the standards of cleanliness are abominable even among so-called educated persons. Going without bathing and the use of indecent language are common. In the modern age people whimsically speak whatever they like, dispensing with all authority, and there is therefore very little truthfulness or true wisdom. Similarly, in both the capitalistic and communistic countries, everyone is busily engaged in stealing and robbing from everyone else in the name of business, taxation or outright crime. People are not confident of the kingdom of God nor of their own eternal nature, and thus their faith is very weak. Moreover, since modern human beings are not very interested in Kåñëa consciousness they constantly quarrel, bicker and fight over completely insignificant issues relating to the material body. Thus at the slightest provocation there are huge wars and massacres. Lust, anger and hankering have become practically unlimited in Kali-yuga. The symptoms and characteristics mentioned here can be abundantly observed throughout the world, wherever people have fallen away from the varëäçrama system. Because of sinful habits such as animal killing, illicit sex, intoxication and gambling, the great majority of human beings have become caëòälas, or untouchables.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The term dvija, or "twice-born," here indicates the three superior classes, namely brähmaëas, kñatriyas and vaiçyas, who all receive the Gäyatré mantra, which signifies their second birth through spiritual initiation. One's first birth is biological, or seminal, and does not necessarily indicate that one is intelligent or enlightened. A young brähmaëa boy, if qualified, may be initiated with Gäyatré mantra at the age of twelve, and kñatriyas and vaiçyas a few years later. In order to become enlightened with spiritual knowledge, the boy resides within the guru-kula, or äçrama of the spiritual master. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness has established similar guru-kulas all over the world and is issuing a great call to civilized human beings to arrange for the proper education of their children. Every young boy and girl should learn to be self-controlled and should become enlightened through study of authorized Vedic literatures. In this way, unlike ordinary animals, insects, fish and birds, etc., an enlightened human being may take birth twice and thus become perfect in the knowledge that leads to ultimate liberation. The word änupürvyät in this verse indicates the system of saàskäras, or purificatory rites, beginning with garbhädhäna-saàskära, or the purification of the sexual act. Generally, çüdras and those who do not follow the Vedic system are not attracted to such purificatory ceremonies; therefore they remain ignorant of spiritual life and envious of the bona fide spiritual master. Those whose character has been civilized by a systematic cleansing process give up the tendency to be argumentative and whimsical and instead become submissive and eager to learn in the presence of a bona fide spiritual master.</div>

<div class="First"> The word adhauta-dad-vasa indicates that a renounced brahmacäré is not concerned with a glistening smile to attract the opposite sex, nor does he pay much attention to his outer garments. Brahmacäré life is meant for austerity and obedience to the spiritual master so that later in life, when one becomes a businessman, politician or intellectual brähmaëa, one will be able to call upon resources of character, discipline, self-control, austerity and humility. Student life, as described here, is far different from the mindless hedonism known as modern education. Of course, in the modern age, Kåñëa conscious brahmacärés cannot artificially adopt the ancient dress and ritualistic duties described here; but the essential values of self-control, purity and obedience to a bona fide spiritual master are just as necessary today as they were in Vedic times.</div>

<div class="First"> This verse appears in Caitanya-caritämåta (Ädi 1.46). His Divine Grace Oà Viñëupäda Paramahaàsa Parivräjakäcärya Añöottara-çata Çré Çrémad A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda has commented on this verse as follows. "This is a verse from Çrémad-Bhägavatam (11.17.27) spoken by Lord Çré Kåñëa when He was questioned by Uddhava regarding the four social and spiritual orders of society. He was specifically instructing how a brahmacäré should behave under the care of a spiritual master. A spiritual master is not an enjoyer of facilities offered by his disciples. He is like a parent. Without the attentive service of his parents, a child cannot grow to manhood; similarly, without the care of the spiritual master one cannot rise to the plane of transcendental service.</div>
<div class="First"> "The spiritual master is also called äcärya, or a transcendental professor of spiritual science. Manu-saàhitä (2.140) explains the duties of an äcärya, describing that a bona fide spiritual maser accepts charge of disciples, teaches them the Vedic knowledge with all its intricacies, and gives them their second birth. The ceremony performed to initiate a disciple into the study of spiritual science is called upanéti, or the function that brings one nearer to the spiritual master. One who cannot be brought nearer to a spiritual master cannot have a sacred thread, and thus he is indicated to be a çüdra. The sacred thread worn on the body of a brähmaëa, kñatriya or vaiçya is a symbol of initiation by the spiritual master; it is worth nothing if worn merely to boast of high parentage. The duty of the spiritual master is to initiate a disciple with the sacred thread ceremony, and after this saàskära, or purificatory process, the spiritual master actually begins to teach the disciple about the Vedas. A person born a çüdra is not barred from such spiritual initiation, provided he is approved by the spiritual master, who is duly authorized to award a disciple the right to be a brähmaëa if he finds him perfectly qualified. In the Väyu Puräëa an äcärya is defined as one who knows the import of all the Vedic literatures, abides by their rules and regulations, and teaches his disciples to act in the same way. "Only out of His immense compassion does the Personality of Godhead reveal Himself as the spiritual master. Therefore in the dealings of an äcärya there are no activities but those of transcendental loving service to the Lord. He is the Supreme Personality of Servitor Godhead. It is worthwhile to take shelter of such a steady devotee, who is called äçraya-vigraha, or the manifestation or form of the Lord of whom one must take shelter. "If one poses himself as an äcärya but does not have an attitude of servitorship to the Lord, he must be considered an offender, and this offensive attitude disqualifies him from being an äcärya. The bona fide spiritual master always engages in unalloyed devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By this test he is known to be a direct manifestation of the Lord and a genuine representative of Çré Nityänanda Prabhu. Such a spiritual master is known as äcäryadeva. Influenced by an envious temperament and dissatisfied because of an attitude of sense gratification, mundaners criticize a real äcärya. In fact, however, a bona fide äcärya is nondifferent from the Personality of Godhead, and therefore to envy such an äcärya is to envy the Personality of Godhead Himself. This will produce an effect subversive to transcendental realization.</div>
<div class="First"> "As mentioned previously, a disciple should always respect the spiritual master as a manifestation of Çré Kåñëa, but at the same time one should always remember that a spiritual master is never authorized to imitate the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. False spiritual masters pose themselves as identical with Çré Kåñëa in every respect, to exploit the sentiments of their disciples, but such impersonalists can only mislead their disciples, for their ultimate aim is to become one with the Lord. This is against the principles of the devotional cult.</div>
<div class="First"> "The real Vedic philosophy is acintya-bhedäbheda-tattva, which establishes everything to be simultaneously one with and different from the Personality of Godhead. Çréla Raghunätha däsa Gosvämé confirms that this is the real position of a bona fide spiritual master and says that one should always think of the spiritual master in terms of his intimate relationship with Mukunda (Çré Kåñëa). Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, in his Bhakti-sandarbha (213), has clearly defined that a pure devotee's observation of the spiritual master and Lord Çiva as one with the Personality of Godhead exists in terms of their being very dear to the Lord, not identical with Him in all respects. Following in the footsteps of Çréla Raghunätha däsa Gosvämé and Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, later äcäryas like Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura have confirmed the same truths. In his prayers to the spiritual master, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura confirms that all the revealed scriptures accept the spiritual master to be identical with the Personality of Godhead because he is a very dear and confidential servant of the Lord. Gauòéya Vaiñëavas therefore worship Çréla Gurudeva (the spiritual master) in the light of his being the servitor of the Personality of Godhead. In all the ancient literatures of devotional service and in the more recent songs of Çréla Narottama däsa Öhäkura, Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura and other unalloyed Vaiñëavas, the spiritual master is always considered to be either one of the confidential associates of Çrématé Rädhäräëé or a manifested representation of Çréla Nityänanda Prabhu."</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> One who desires to receive the mercy of a bona fide spiritual master should not be eager to accumulate the paraphernalia of sense gratification; rather, whatever one is able to collect one should offer at the lotus feet of the äcärya. Being self-controlled, one should humbly accept that which is allotted by the bona fide spiritual master. Every living entity must ultimately be trained to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but until one has become expert in the techniques of spiritual service one should offer everything to the spiritual master, who is completely realized in the process of worshiping the Lord. When the spiritual master sees that the disciple is advanced in Kåñëa consciousness, he then engages the disciple in directly worshiping the Personality of Godhead. A bona fide spiritual master does not use anything for his personal sense gratification and entrusts to his disciple only as much material opulence as the disciple can properly offer to the lotus feet of the Lord. The example may be given that when an ordinary father tries to train his son in business and other material activities, he entrusts to the son only as much wealth as the son can intelligently engage in profitable enterprises without foolishly wasting the father's hard-earned money. Similarly, the bona fide spiritual master teaches his disciple to worship the Lord, and an immature disciple must simply deliver everything to the lotus feet of the guru, just as an immature child does not keep a personal bank account but rather receives his maintenance from the father, who trains the son to be responsible. If one cheats oneself by defying the order of a bona fide spiritual master or Kåñëa, one certainly becomes a nondevotee, or sense enjoyer, and falls from the spiritual path. Therefore, one should be trained to serve a bona fide spiritual master and thus become mature in Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

One who is not married—a sannyäsé, brahmacäré or vänaprastha—should rigidly avoid anything related to sex and of course should never see any living entity, whether bird, insect or human, engaging in the various phases of sexual intercourse. When a man jokes with a woman, an intimate, sexually-charged atmosphere is immediately created, and this should also be avoided for those aspiring to practice celibacy.

<div class="First"> The process of liberation is described in this verse. Once when Çréla Prabhupäda was traveling by airplane, a fellow passenger, who happened to be a priest, told him that he had seen his disciples and found them "bright-faced." Çréla Prabhupäda was fond of relating this incident. The spirit soul is more brilliant than the sun, and as the process of spiritual purification gradually takes effect, even the external form of a devotee becomes effulgent. The glowing fire of spiritual knowledge burns to ashes the mentality of sense gratification, and one naturally becomes austere and disinterested in mundane enjoyment. Among all austerities, the best is celibacy, by which the shackles of material life immediately become slackened. One who is amala, free from material desire, is known as a pure devotee of the Lord. On the paths of jïäna, karma and yoga the mind retains the concept of personal interest, but on the path of pure devotion the mind is trained to see only the interests of the Personality of Godhead. Thus a pure devotee of the Lord is amala, completely pure.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> This verse describes the process called samävartana, or returning to one's home after finishing Vedic education in the äçrama of the spiritual master. One who cannot concentrate all of his desires in the devotional service of the Lord is attracted to householder life, and if this attraction is not regulated, one will fall down. Being covered by the ignorance of fruitive activities and mental speculation, a living entity seeks enjoyment outside the devotional service of the Supreme Lord and becomes a nondevotee. One who takes to family life must rigidly follow the Vedic rules and regulations in order to avoid the collapse of his spiritual determination. One who enjoys intimate sense gratification with women must become duplicitous in his dealings with others and consequently falls down from the platform of simple, pure life. When the mind is disturbed by lust, one begins to resent the principle of submission to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His pure devotee, and the dark clouds of one's offensive mentality completely cover the light of spiritual knowledge. One should dovetail his propensity to love someone by serving the lotus feet of a pure devotee. As stated in Vedic literature, "One who worships Govinda, Lord Kåñëa, but does not worship His devotees is not to be considered an advanced Vaiñëava; rather, he is to be considered a proud hypocrite."</div>

<div class="Translation"> A brahmacäré desiring to fulfill his material desires should live at home with his family, and a householder who is eager to purify his consciousness should enter the forest, whereas a purified brähmaëa should accept the renounced order of life. One who is not surrendered to Me should move progressively from one äçrama to another, never acting otherwise.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Those who are not surrendered devotees of the Lord must rigidly observe the regulations governing one's authorized social status. There are four social divisions of life, namely brahmacarya, gåhastha, vänaprastha and sannyäsa. One who wants to fulfill material desires should become an ordinary householder (gåhastha), establish a comfortable residence and maintain his family. One desiring to accelerate the process of purification may give up his home and business and live in a sacred place with his wife, as indicated here by the word vanam, or "forest." There are many sacred forests in India meant for this purpose, such as Våndävana and Mäyäpur. The word dvijottama indicates the brähmaëas. Brähmaëas, kñatriyas and vaiçyas are all dvija, or initiated in the Gäyatré mantra, but the brähmaëa is dvijottama, or the highest among those who have received second birth by spiritual initiation. It is recommended that a purified brähmaëa take to the renounced order of life (sannyäsa), giving up further contact with his so-called wife. The brähmaëa is specifically mentioned here, since kñatriyas and vaiçyas are not to take the renounced order of life. Even so, there are many stories in the Bhägavatam wherein great kings retire with their aristocratic wives to the forest to practice the austerities of vänaprastha and thus accelerate the process of purification. The brähmaëas, however, may directly accept the renounced order of life. The words äçramäd äçramaà gacchet indicate that one may progressively move from brahmacäré life to gåhastha life to vänaprastha life and then to sannyäsa. The words äçramäd äçramam emphasize that one should never remain without an authorized social status, nor should one go backward, falling down from a higher position. Those who are not surrendered devotees of the Lord must rigidly observe such injunctions, for otherwise they will quickly become degraded, and their sins will place them outside the bounds of authorized human civilization.</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa emphasizes here that a nondevotee must rigidly observe the rituals and regulations of Vedic social divisions, whereas the Lord's pure devotee, engaged twenty-four hours a day in Lord Kåñëa's mission, is transcendental to such divisions. If, however, one performs illicit activities on the strength of being transcendental to Vedic social divisions, one is revealed to be a materialistic neophyte and not an advanced devotee of the Lord. An advanced devotee, who remains aloof from material sense gratification, is not bound by the Vedic social divisions; thus even a householder may live very austerely, traveling and preaching Kåñëa consciousness away from home, and even a sannyäsé may sometimes engage women in the devotional service of Lord Kåñëa. The most advanced devotees cannot be restricted by the rituals and regulations of the varëäçrama system, and they move freely around the world distributing love of Godhead. Mat-para indicates a pure devotee of the Lord who always keeps the Lord fixed in his heart and consciousness. One who falls down to become a victim of sense gratification is not fully established on the platform of mat-para and should rigidly observe the social divisions and regulations to remain steady on the platform of pious human life.</div>

<div class="First"> The purport of this verse is that one's first wife must always be sadåçém, or similar to oneself. In other words, an intellectual man should marry an intellectual wife, a heroic man should marry a heroic wife, a business minded man should marry a woman who can encourage him in such activities, and a çüdra should marry a less intelligent woman. The wife must be beyond reproach in terms of her background and character and should always be younger than oneself, ideally five to ten years younger. If one desires to marry a second wife, then, as stated in this verse by the word varëänupürvyeëa and in the verse spoken by Lord Kåñëa by the word anukramät, one must wait until the first marriage is established and then select a second wife from the next-lower caste. If one marries a third time the wife must be, again, from the next-lower caste. For example, a brähmaëa's first wife will be a brähmaëé, his second wife will be from the kñatriya community, his third wife from the vaiçya community and fourth wife from the çüdra community. A kñatriya may first marry a kñatriya lady and then vaiçya and çüdra ladies. A vaiçya can accept wives from two classes, and a çüdra will accept a wife only from the çüdra class. By this progression of marriages there will be relative peace in the family. These Vedic marriage injunctions, as mentioned in the previous verse, are especially for those who are not pure devotees of the Lord.</div>

<div class="First"> All civilized men must participate in sacrificial performances, give charity and study the Vedic literature. The best of the twice-born, namely the brähmaëas, are specifically empowered to lead sacrificial performances on behalf of all members of society, teach everyone Vedic knowledge and receive everyone's charity. Without the assistance or participation of qualified brähmaëas, the lower classes cannot properly study the Vedic literature, perform sacrifices or give in charity, because they do not have the required intelligence to perfectly execute such functions. When kñatriyas and vaiçyas take shelter of bona fide brähmaëas, they are able to properly execute their respective duties, and society functions smoothly and efficiently.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> A pure devotee of the Lord should always remember that the Supreme Personality of Godhead will personally take care of him. As the Lord states in Bhagavad-gétä (9.22):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ananyäç cintayanto mäà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ye janäù paryupäsate</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">yoga-kñemaà vahämy aham</div>
<div class="First"> "But those who worship Me with devotion, meditating on My transcendental form—to them I carry what they lack and preserve what they have." A brähmaëa should not become a professional beggar for his personal maintenance. In India there are many so-called brähmaëas who sit at the gates of important temples and beg from everyone who comes and goes. If someone does not give a donation they become angry and chase that person. Similarly, in America there are many big preachers who collect huge amounts of money by begging on television and radio. If a brähmaëa or Vaiñëava considers that being a professional beggar is weakening his austerity, destroying his spiritual influence and giving him a bad reputation, then he should give up that process. One may beg everyone to contribute to the cause of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but one will be diminished in austerity, influence and reputation by begging for one's personal livelihood. A brähmaëa may then take up the task of teaching Vedic knowledge and performing sacrifice. But even such occupations do not bring one to the highest platform of trust in God. A brähmaëa who teaches as a means of livelihood may often be curbed in his teaching, and one who performs sacrifice may be manipulated by materialistic worshipers. In this way, a brähmaëa may be placed in an embarrassing and compromised position. Therefore a high-class brähmaëa or Vaiñëava ultimately will depend completely on the mercy of the Lord for his maintenance. The Lord promises to maintain His devotee, and an advanced Vaiñëava never doubts the word of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The body of a brähmaëa is not intended to enjoy insignificant material sense gratification; rather, by accepting difficult austerities in his life, a brähmaëa will enjoy unlimited happiness after death.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> One may ask why a brähmaëa should voluntarily accept inconvenience in keeping his body and soul together. In this verse the Lord explains that advanced human life is meant for serious austerity and not for insignificant sense gratification. By spiritual advancement one is fixed in transcendental bliss on the spiritual platform and gives up useless absorption in the temporary material body. One should remain detached from the material body, accepting only the bare necessities of life. The brähmaëas, by accepting a troublesome form of livelihood, never forget that the material body is destined to grow old, become diseased and die in misery. Thus remaining alert and transcendental, an advanced brähmaëa, at the end of this life, goes back home, back to Godhead, where he enjoys unlimited spiritual bliss. Without such higher awareness, how can one be considered a qualified brähmaëa? Those devotees engaged twenty-four hours a day in spreading the mission of Lord Kåñëa are beyond the platform of renunciation or sense gratification because they engage everything in Lord Kåñëa's service. A pure devotee of the Lord eats only to get strength for serving the Lord and does not accept either sumptuous or meager food simply for the body's sake. However, everything may be accepted for the Lord, even sumptuous meals. A brähmaëa who is not working day and night to spread the glories of the Lord should feel embarrassed to eat sumptuously for his personal sense gratification, but a renounced Vaiñëava preacher may accept invitations from all classes of pious people, and just to bless their homes he will eat the opulent foods they offer to him. Similarly, he sometimes eats sumptuously to get strength for defeating atheists and impersonalists. As stated in Vedic literature, one cannot be a highly qualified brähmaëa unless one becomes a devotee of the Lord. And among the devotees, those who are preaching Kåñëa consciousness are the best, as confirmed by the Lord Himself in the Eighteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä.</div>

<div class="First"> A family man often acts like a lord, protecting his wife, ordering his children, maintaining servants, grandchildren, domestic animals, and so forth. The words na pramädyet kuöumby api indicate that although one acts like a little lord, surrounded by his family, servants and friends, one should not, through false pride, become mentally unbalanced, considering oneself to be the actual lord. The word vipaçcit indicates that one should remain sober and intelligent, never forgetting oneself to be the eternal servant of the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> Householders of the upper, middle and lower classes become attached to different types of sense gratification. In any economic or social class, however, one should remember that all material enjoyment, either here or in the next life, is temporary and ultimately useless. A responsible householder should guide his family members and other dependents back home, back to Godhead, for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge. One should not become a false and puffed-up lord for a brief span of time, for then one will remain bound up, along with his family members, in the cycle of repeated birth and death.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The association of children, wife, relatives and friends is just like the brief meeting of travelers. With each change of body one is separated from all such associates, just as one loses the objects one possesses in a dream when the dream is over.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Päntha-saìgama indicates the momentary association of travelers at hotels, restaurants, tourist spots or, in more traditional cultures, freshwater wells and walking paths. We are now associated with many relatives, friends and well-wishers, but as soon as we change our material body we will immediately be separated from all these associates, just as upon awakening we are immediately separated from the imaginary situation of a dream. One becomes attached to the sense gratification of one's dream, and similarly, under the spell of the illusory concepts of "I" and "mine," we become attached to so-called relatives and friends who gratify our sense of false ego. Unfortunately, such fleeting egoistic association covers our real knowledge of the self and the Supreme, and we remain hovering in material illusion, futilely endeavoring for permanent sense gratification. One who remains attached to the bodily concept of family and friends cannot possibly give up the false egoism of "I" and "mine," or "I am everything and everything is mine." Without giving up material sense gratification we cannot become steady on the transcendental platform of devotional service, and therefore we cannot relish the actual flavor of eternal happiness. Unless one becomes a pure devotee of the Lord, accepting Lord Kåñëa as one's only friend, one cannot give up the hankering for temporary and superficial material relationships. A traveler far away from his home and loved ones may strike up superficial conversations with other travelers, but such relationships have no ultimate meaning. One should therefore revive one's lost relationship with Lord Kåñëa. We are constitutionally part and parcel of Lord Kåñëa, who is the reservoir of all spiritual pleasure, and our original relationship with Him is full of love and happiness. But because of our desire to enjoy independently from Him, we fall down into the confusing, meaningless network of material relationships created by mäyä. An intelligent person realizes there is no actual pleasure or satisfaction for the soul on either this planet or any other material planet. Therefore, like a weary traveler exhausted from his journey, he should go back home, back to Godhead, for eternal peace as the faithful servant of Lord Çré Kåñëa.</div>

<div class="First"> This verse describes the three alternatives for a householder. He may continue at home, or he may take vänaprastha, which involves going to a sacred place with one's wife. Or if he has a responsible son to take over his family duties, he may take sannyäsa, the renounced order, for a definitive solution to the problems of life. In all three äçramas, ultimate success depends on sincere surrender to the Supreme Lord; therefore, the most important qualification one can have is Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

Somehow or other, we must fix our minds on Lord Kåñëa and come out of the darkness of ignorance to our real life in Kåñëa consciousness.</div>
<div class="First"> Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Seventeenth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Lord Kåñëa's Description of the Varëäçrama System."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 18. Description of Varëäçrama-dharma</div>
<div class="First"> As related in this chapter, Lord Çré Kåñëa explained to Uddhava the duties of the vänaprastha and sannyäsa orders and the religious practices proper to each of these levels of advancement.</div>
<div class="First"> One who is taking to the vänaprastha stage of life should leave his wife at home in the care of his sons, or else take her along, and with a peaceful mind spend the third quarter of his life in the forest. He should accept as his food whatever bulbs, fruits, roots and so on that grow in the forest, taking sometimes grains cooked by fire and sometimes fruits ripened by time. Furthermore, he should take as his garments tree bark, grass, leaves or the skin of a deer. It is prescribed that he should perform austerities by not cutting his hair, beard, or nails. Nor should he make any special attempt to remove dirt from his limbs. He should bathe three times daily in cold water and sleep upon the ground. During the hot season he should stand beneath the fearsome heat of the sun with fires blazing on four sides. During the rainy season he should stand in the midst of the downpour of rain, and during the cold winter he should submerge himself in water up to his neck. He is absolutely forbidden to clean his teeth, to store food that he has collected at one time to eat at another time, and to worship the Supreme Lord with the flesh of animals. If he can maintain those severe practices for the remainder of his life, the vänaprastha will achieve the Tapoloka planet.</div>
<div class="First"> The fourth quarter of life is meant for sannyäsa. One should develop complete detachment from attaining residence on different planets, up to even Brahmaloka. Such wishes for material elevation are due to desire for the fruits of material activity. When one recognizes that endeavors to achieve residence on the higher planets ultimately award only suffering, then it is enjoined that one should take to sannyäsa in a spirit of renunciation. The process of accepting sannyäsa involves worshiping the Lord with sacrifice, giving everything one possesses in charity to the priests and establishing within one's own heart the various sacrificial fires. For a sannyäsé, association with women or even the sight of women is more undesirable than taking poison. Except in emergencies, the sannyäsé should never wear more clothing than a loincloth or some simple covering over his loincloth. He should carry no more than his staff and waterpot. Giving up all violence to living creatures, he should become subdued in the functions of his body, mind and speech. He should remain detached and fixed on the self and travel alone to such pure places as the mountains, rivers and forests. Thus engaged, he should remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead and dwell in a place that is fearless and not heavily populated. He should take his alms each day at seven homes chosen at random from those of the members of the four social classes, avoiding only the homes of those who are cursed or fallen. With a pure heart he should offer to the Supreme Personality of Godhead whatever food he has collected and take the mahä-prasädam remnants. In this way he should always be mindful that hankering for sense gratification is bondage and that engaging the objects of the senses in the service of Lord Mädhava is liberation. If one lacks knowledge and renunciation, or continues to be troubled by the unconquered six enemies headed by lust and the all-powerful senses, or if one accepts the tri-daëòa renounced order simply for the purpose of carrying out a livelihood, then he will achieve as his result only the killing of his own soul. A paramahaàsa is not under the control of injunctions and prohibitions. He is a devotee of the Supreme Lord, detached from external sense gratification and completely free from desire for even such subtle gratificatory goals as liberation. He is expert in discrimination and, just like a simple child, is free from concepts of pride and insult. Although actually competent, he wanders about like a dull person, and although most learned, he engages himself like an insane fool in incoherent speech. Although actually fixed in the Vedas, he behaves in an unordered fashion. He tolerates the evil words of others and never shows contempt for anyone else. He avoids acting as an enemy or vainly indulging in argument. He sees the Supreme Personality of Godhead in all creatures and also all living beings within the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In order to keep his body alive for performing worship of the Lord, he accepts whatever excellent or inferior food, clothing and bedding he can obtain without endeavor. Although he has to make some effort to find food for maintaining his body, he does not become joyful when he finds something, nor does he become depressed when not finding anything. The Supreme Lord Himself, although not at all subject to the Vedic orders and prohibitions, by His own free will executes various prescribed duties; similarly the paramahaàsa, even while on the platform of freedom from subjugation to Vedic rules and prohibitions, carries out various duties. Because his perception of dualities has become completely eradicated by transcendental knowledge, which is focused on the Supreme Lord, he obtains upon the demise of his material body the liberation known as särñöi, in which one becomes equal in opulence with the Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> The person who desires his own best interest should take shelter of a bona fide spiritual master. Filling his mind with faith, keeping free from enviousness and remaining fixed in devotion, the disciple should serve the spiritual master, whom he should regard as nondifferent from the Supreme Lord. For a brahmacäré, the primary duty is service to the spiritual master. The main duties for a householder are protection of living beings and sacrifice, for a vänaprastha austerities, and for a sannyäsé self-control and nonviolence. Celibacy (practiced by householders at all times except once a month when the wife is fertile), penance, cleanliness, self-satisfaction, friendship with all living beings and above all worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are duties meant for every jéva soul. One acquires firm devotion for the Supreme Lord by always rendering service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead through one's own particular prescribed duty, by not engaging in the worship of any other personalities, and also by thinking of all creatures as the place of residence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form as the Supersoul. The followers of the karma-käëòa section of the Vedas can attain the planets of the forefathers and so on by their ritualistic activities, but if they become endowed with devotion for the Supreme Lord, then by these same activities they can achieve the supreme stage of liberation.</div>

A man who has a reasonable expectation of living for one hundred years may adopt the vänaprastha order at the age of fifty, and then at the age of seventy-five he may take sannyäsa for complete renunciation. Since in Kali-yuga very few people live for one hundred years, one should adjust the schedule accordingly. Vänaprastha is intended as a gradual transition from materialistic family life to the stage of complete renunciation.</div>

This regulation is meant to keep one fixed in faithful dependence on the Supreme Lord. One should never stock food or other bodily necessities for future use. The term deça-käla-baläbhijïa indicates that in a particularly difficult place, or in time of emergency or personal incapacity, this strict rule need not be followed, as confirmed by Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura points out that unless one is completely incapacitated, one should not depend on others for one's personal maintenance, as this will create a debt that can only be repaid by taking another birth in the material world. This applies only to those endeavoring for personal purification and not to those engaged full time in devotional service to Lord Kåñëa. A pure devotee eats, dresses and speaks only for the service of the Lord, and thus whatever assistance he accepts from others is not for himself. He is fully surrendered to the mission of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. However, one not so surrendered will certainly have to take birth again in the material world to repay all of his debts to others.</div>

One who does not become completely Kåñëa conscious, however, first goes to the planet Maharloka, or Åñiloka, and from there directly achieves Lord Kåñëa. One achieves Maharloka, or Åñiloka, through strict observance of positive and negative regulations. However, without developing a taste for chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord (çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù [SB 7.5.23]), it is not possible to achieve the perfect liberation of going back home, back to Godhead. Therefore, on the Maharloka planet the unsuccessful sage gives more attention to chanting and hearing, and thus he gradually develops pure love of Godhead.</div>

One may possess a beautiful garden filled with fruits and flowers, but without vigilant maintenance the garden will be overrun by weeds.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word daëòa indicates the staff carried by those in the renounced order of life, and daëòa also indicates severe discipline. The Vaiñëava sannyäsés accept a staff made of three bamboo rods, signifying dedication of the body, mind and words to the service of the Supreme Lord. Here Lord Kåñëa says that one must first accept these three daëòas, or disciplines (namely control of the voice, body and mind), within oneself. The practice of aniläyäma (or präëäyäma, regulating the life air) is meant to control the mind, and one who always thinks of service to Lord Kåñëa has certainly achieved the perfection of präëäyäma. Merely carrying the three external daëòas without assimilating the internal daëòas of bodily, mental and vocal discipline can never make one an actual Vaiñëava sannyäsé, as explained here by Lord Kåñëa. In the Haàsa-gétä section of Mahäbhärata and in Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé's Upadeçämåta, there are instructions regarding the sannyäsa order of life. A conditioned soul who adopts only the external ornaments of tridaëòé-sannyäsa will not actually be able to control the senses. One who takes sannyäsa for false prestige, making a show of saintliness without actual advancement in kåñëa-kértana, will soon be vanquished by the external energy of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Rejecting those houses that are polluted and untouchable, one should approach without previous calculation seven houses and be satisfied with that which is obtained there by begging. According to necessity, one may approach each of the four occupational orders of society.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Saintly persons in the renounced order of life may beg from strict followers of Vedic culture to obtain foodstuffs and other bodily necessities. According to Vedic injunction, a renounced saint should beg from the brähmaëa community, but if there is danger of his starving, he may beg from kñatriyas, then vaiçyas, and even çüdras if they are not sinful, as expressed here by the word vigarhyän. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura explains that asaìkÿptän indicates that one should not approach certain houses, calculating, "In that place I can get first-class food. That house has a big reputation among beggars." Without discriminating, one should go to seven houses and be satisfied with whatever may be obtained there. One should beg for one's personal maintenance only from houses where the inhabitants, being sincere followers of the varëäçrama culture, have earned their livelihood by honest means and are free from sinful activities. One may beg alms from such householders. One must not beg alms for one's personal maintenance from those who oppose the Supreme Lord's devotional service, for such service is the whole purpose of varëäçrama culture.</div>
<div class="First"> Those who oppose Vedic culture pass laws to make begging by saintly persons a criminal act. They thus insult and persecute saintly beggars, considering them to be ordinary vagrants. A lazy person begging to avoid work is certainly abominable, but a saintly person dedicated to the service of the Lord and practicing the discipline of begging to develop full dependence on the Lord's mercy should be given all facility in human society. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura explains that there are three forms of collecting alms. Mädhukara is the process of imitating the bee, who collects a tiny amount of nectar from each flower. In this way, the saintly person accepts a very small amount from each person, avoiding social conflict. The process mentioned here is asaìkÿpta, by which one indiscriminately approaches seven houses, being satisfied with whatever may be obtained. Präk-praëéta is that process by which one establishes regular donors and collects one's maintenance from them. In this regard Çréla Véraräghava Äcärya has described the initial stage of sannyäsa, called kuöécaka, as follows. A man accepting the initial stage of sannyäsa arranges for his children or other relatives and well-wishers to build him a kuöé, or meditation cottage. He gives up worldly affairs and sits within the cottage, trying to remain free from lust, anger, greed, illusion and so on. According to the prescribed injunctions of regulated life, he accepts a tri-daëòa, purifies himself with a waterpot, shaves his head (leaving a çikhä, or tuft), chants Gäyatré mantra on the sacred thread and wears saffron garments. Bathing regularly, cleansing, performing äcamana, chanting japa, studying the Vedas, remaining celibate and meditating on the Lord, he receives regular supplies of food from his children, friends and relatives. Accepting only the bare necessities of life, he remains fixed in his cottage up to the moment of liberation.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> One who remains attached to material sense gratification cannot be steady in the process of chanting Hare Kåñëa. Being shackled by illusory desires, he is not able to fully control the senses. Actually, one should take shelter of devotional service to Lord Kåñëa twenty-four hours a day, for by such service one remains within the scope of spiritual reality. By chanting and hearing the holy names of the Lord along with the Lord's glories and pastimes, one naturally drifts away from the field of material sense gratification. Good association with Lord Kåñëa and His devotees automatically vanquishes useless material association, and one is able to carry out the Vedic injunctions meant to lift the conditioned soul out of the material field and onto the liberated platform of Kåñëa consciousness. In this regard, Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé states in</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">his Upadeçämåta (4),</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">dadäti pratigåhëäti</div>

<div class="First"> "Offering gifts in charity, accepting charitable gifts, revealing one's mind in confidence, inquiring confidentially, accepting prasädam and offering prasädam are the six symptoms of love shared by one devotee and another." One who thus learns to associate with the Lord's devotees actually remains insulated from the contamination of material life. By pure association one gradually understands the name, form, qualities, associates, pastimes and devotional service of Lord Çré Kåñëa, and thus even in this lifetime one can become a resident of the spiritual world. In the association of pure devotees there is no material contamination and no useless discussion, since all pure devotees are fully engaged twenty-four hours a day in the loving service of the Lord. By the influence of such devotees, one develops equal vision (sama-darçana) and sees the realized knowledge of Kåñëa consciousness everywhere. As one begins to understand his eternal relationship with Lord Kåñëa, he becomes ätma-vän, situated in his constitutional position. An advanced Vaiñëava, constantly enjoying the mellows of loving devotional service and carrying out the mission of the Lord on the earth, is ätma-kréòa, one who enjoys life within the internal potency of the Supreme Lord. The advanced devotee remains constantly attracted to the Supreme Lord and His devotees and is therefore ätma-rata, fully satisfied by constant engagement in devotional service. One cannot possibly develop the exalted qualities mentioned here without becoming an unalloyed devotee of Lord Kåñëa. One who is envious of the Lord and His devotees becomes attracted to bad association, gradually loses control of the senses and falls down into the network of impious life. The innumerable varieties of nondevotees are like branches sprouting from the single tree of enviousness of the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, and their association should be given up by all means. Without unalloyed devotional service to the Lord, one loses touch with the desire and mission of the Personality of Godhead and becomes attracted to worshiping the wonderful male and female creations of the Lord's illusory energy—demigods, demigoddesses, celebrities, politicians, prostitutes, etc. In this way, one foolishly considers something besides Lord Kåñëa to be supremely wonderful. Actually, Lord Kåñëa is the only true object of worship for those desiring to experience unlimited beauty and pleasure. By seriously taking to Kåñëa consciousness one can realize the transcendental position of Lord Kåñëa and gradually develop all of the qualities mentioned in this verse.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> One who is engaged exclusively in the devotional service of the Lord in one of the five principal relationships is to be known as a pure Vaiñëava. Because of his advanced stage of love of Godhead, a pure devotee is able to constantly chant the glories of the Lord without material hindrance. He is not interested in anything except Lord Kåñëa and never considers himself to be qualitatively different from the Lord. One who is still attracted by the gross material body and subtle material mind, which cover the eternal soul, continues to see himself as different from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This misconception is due to false identification with matter. With senses purified of material contamination, one must serve the Lord, who is the master of all senses, and thus one's devotional service is considered free from discrepancy. One who ignores the injunctions of Vedic literature uselessly wastes his sense activity in illusory material activities. He falsely considers himself to be different from Lord Kåñëa and therefore imagines that he possesses an interest independent of the Lord's interest. There is no possibility that such a person can achieve steadiness in life, because the material field of action is constantly being shifted and transformed by the disturbing influence of time. If a devotee begins to cultivate an interest apart from the loving service of the Lord, his meditation on his oneness with the Lord will be disturbed and overturned. When the mind deviates from the lotus feet of the Lord, the duality of material nature again becomes prominent within the mind, and one resumes a work program based on the three modes of material nature. One who is not fixed in one's own relationship with the Supreme Lord cannot be fearless or steady and is deprived of the shelter of Lord Çré Kåñëa. Therefore one should seriously contemplate, as described in this verse, one's identity as a small particle of consciousness not different from the supreme consciousness, Lord Kåñëa. Thus one should remain steady in Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

Such steady sense control gives one relief from the harassment of material sense gratification.</div>

The vänaprastha or sannyäsé trying to become free from material attachment should avoid those who are working day and night for sense gratification, approaching them only to engage them in necessary acts of charity. Those who are preaching Kåñëa consciousness all over the world are understood to be liberated souls, and therefore they constantly approach the materialistic living entities to engage them in the devotional service of Lord Kåñëa. However, even such preachers should strictly avoid contact with the materialistic world when not actually necessary for advancing the mission of Kåñëa consciousness. The injunction is that one should not deal unnecessarily with the materialistic world.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In the Western countries people are generally so dull that they cannot distinguish between a saintly beggar and an ordinary hobo or hippie. A saintly beggar is constantly engaged in authorized devotional service to the Supreme Lord and accepts only what he requires for his bare maintenance. The author of this book remembers entering the Kåñëa consciousness society as an arrogant university student and being quickly humbled by the process of begging on the street on behalf of Kåñëa. This process is not theoretical but actually purifies one's existence by forcing one to offer respect to all others. Unless one offers respect to others, one's begging will be fruitless. Also, by begging one will not often eat very sumptuously. This is good because when the tongue is controlled the other senses are quickly pacified. A vänaprastha should never give up the purifying process of begging for his food, and ordinary people should not foolishly equate a lazy bum living at the cost of others with a saintly beggar engaged in higher duties for the Supreme Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> One should logically consider the universe, which is situated within the Lord, and one's own material body, which is composed of mind, speech and life air, to be ultimately products of the Lord's illusory energy.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Every conditioned soul considers the material world to be the object of his personal sense gratification and therefore considers the material body to be his actual identity. The word tyaktvä indicates that one must give up one's false identification with the material world and the material body, since both are merely products of the illusory potency of the Lord. One should never again meditate on the material world and body as objects of sense gratification but rather should become situated in Kåñëa consciousness. Looking at things from the eternal point of view, this world is simply illusory. The material energy of the Lord is devoid of consciousness and thus cannot be the basis of actual happiness. The Supreme Lord Himself is the only absolutely conscious entity. He is absolutely self-sufficient, standing alone as Viñëu, the Personality of Godhead. Only Viñëu, and not the insignificant workings of material nature, can give us the actual perfection of life.</div>

<div class="Translation"> A learned transcendentalist dedicated to the cultivation of knowledge and thus detached from external objects, or My devotee who is detached even from desire for liberation—both neglect those duties based on external rituals or paraphernalia. Thus their conduct is beyond the range of rules and regulations.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> This verse describes the paramahaàsa stage of life, in which there is no further need for rituals, external paraphernalia or rules and regulations. A completely realized jïäna-yogé pursuing liberation, or beyond that, a perfect devotee of the Lord who does not desire even liberation, has no further desire for material engagement. When one completely purifies the mind, there is no possibility of sinful behavior. Rules and regulations are meant for guiding those who have a tendency to act in ignorance or for personal gratification, but one who is perfect in spiritual consciousness can move freely, as described here by the Lord. One who tends to drive a car recklessly or who is unfamiliar with the local road conditions certainly needs the discipline of elaborate road signs and police enforcement of traffic laws. A perfectly safe driver, however, is thoroughly familiar with the local road conditions. He has no real need for the enforcement officials or the speed limits and caution signs meant for those unfamiliar with the road. A pure devotee of the Lord desires nothing except service to the Lord; he automatically fulfills the purport of all negative and positive injunctions, which is to always remember Kåñëa and never forget Him. One should not, however, artificially imitate the exalted position of a paramahaàsa devotee, for such imitation will quickly ruin one's spiritual career.</div>
<div class="First"> In the previous verses the Lord has elaborately described various rituals, paraphernalia and disciplines for the various spiritual orders of life. The sannyäsé, for example, carries a tri-daëòa and a waterpot and eats and lives in a particular way. A paramahaàsa devotee, having completely given up all attachment and interest in the material world, is no longer attracted by such external features of renunciation.</div>

<div class="First"> A paramahaàsa-sannyäsé, fearing that his mind may be deviated by the tremendous prestige that people sometimes offer to a perfectly self-realized person, conceals his position as described in this verse. A self-realized person does not try to please the mass of people, nor does he desire social prestige, since the mission of his life is to remain detached from the material world and to always please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although neglecting ordinary rules and regulations, a paramahaàsa does not ever become sinful or immoral, but rather neglects ritualistic aspects of religious custom, such as dressing in a particular way, performing certain ceremonies or executing specific penances and austerities.</div>
<div class="First"> The pure devotees of the Lord who have dedicated their lives to propagating the Lord's holy name must very expertly present Kåñëa consciousness in a way pleasing to the mass of people so that they will accept it. Those who are preaching should try to make Lord Çré Kåñëa popular without trying to advance their personal prestige in the name of missionary progress. A paramahaàsa not engaged in distributing Kåñëa consciousness, however, should have no attachment whatsoever to public opinion.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Although a paramahaàsa devotee conceals his exalted position, certain activities are forbidden even for one trying to conceal himself. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains that in the name of concealment one should not become a ghost. The word päsaëòa refers to atheistic philosophies opposing the Vedas, such as Buddhism, and haituka refers to those who accept only that which can be demonstrated by mundane logic or experimentation. Since the whole purpose of the Vedas is to understand that which is beyond material experience, a skeptic's so-called logic is irrelevant to spiritual progress. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé warns us in this regard that a devotee should not read atheistic literature, even with the purpose of refining arguments against atheism. Such literature should be entirely avoided. The above-mentioned prohibited activities are so detrimental to the advancement of Kåñëa consciousness that they should not be adopted even as a superficial show.</div>

A sage should not become happily excited when a sumptuous plate is brought to him, nor should he angrily refuse ordinary food that comes of its own accord. If no food comes at all, as mentioned in the previous verse, one must endeavor to avoid starvation. From these verses it appears that even a saintly sage must have a good dose of common sense.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Just as I, the Supreme Lord, execute regulative duties by My own free will, similarly, one who has realized knowledge of Me should maintain general cleanliness, purify his hands with water, take bath and execute other regulative duties not by force but by his own free will.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> When the Supreme Personality of Godhead descends to the material world, He generally observes the Vedic regulative duties to set a proper example for mankind. The Lord acts by His own free will, since no one can oblige, force or impel the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, the jïäné, or self-realized soul, is fixed on the spiritual platform, beyond the material body, and should therefore execute the regulative duties in relation to the material body by his own free will and not as a servant of the rules and regulations. A self-realized soul is a servant of Lord Kåñëa and not of rules and regulations. Nevertheless, a transcendentalist strictly complies with regular duties for the pleasure of the Supreme Lord. In other words, one who is advanced in loving devotional service to Lord Kåñëa spontaneously moves according to the will of the Supreme. One who is perfectly situated in spiritual realization cannot become a servant of the material body or of rules and regulations concerning the material body. However, this verse and other similar statements in Vedic scriptures should not be ignorantly misinterpreted to justify immoral, whimsical behavior. Lord Kåñëa is discussing the paramahaàsa stage of life, and those who are attached to the material body have nothing to do with this paramahaàsa stage, nor should they exploit its unique privileges and status.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> A realized soul no longer sees anything as separate from Me, for his realized knowledge of Me has destroyed such illusory perception. Since the material body and mind were previously accustomed to this kind of perception, it may sometimes appear to recur; but at the time of death the self-realized soul achieves opulences equal to Mine.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa explained in verse 32 of this chapter that all material and spiritual objects are expansions of His potency. By realized knowledge of the Lord one gives up the illusion that anything, anywhere, at any time, can be separate from Lord Kåñëa. Lord Kåñëa has also explained, however, that one must keep the material body and mind fit for executing devotional service; therefore even a self-realized soul may sometimes appear to accept or reject certain conditions or objects within this world. Such brief apparent duality of concentration upon something other than Kåñëa does not change the liberated status of a self-realized soul, who achieves at the time of death the same opulences as Lord Kåñëa in the spiritual world. The function of illusion is to separate one from Lord Kåñëa, but the brief and occasional appearance of duality in the behavior or mentality of a pure devotee never separates him from the Lord. It does not constitute actual illusion, for it lacks the essential function of illusion, namely, the separation of one from Lord Kåñëa. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura describes the self-realized devotees as follows. The devotee of the Lord does not see anything as separate from Lord Kåñëa and thus does not consider himself to be a permanent resident of the material world. At every moment the devotee is moved by his desire to serve Lord Kåñëa. Just as those who are inclined to sense gratification pass their time making arrangements for their enjoyment, similarly the devotees are busy throughout the day arranging their devotional service to Lord Kåñëa. Therefore they have no time to act like materialistic sense enjoyers. To ordinary persons it may seem that a pure devotee is seeing something as separate from Kåñëa, but a pure devotee is actually fixed in his status as a liberated soul and is guaranteed to achieve a spiritual body in the kingdom of God. Ordinary, materialistic persons cannot always understand the activities of a pure devotee of the Lord, and thus they may try to minimize his position, considering him to be the same as themselves. At the end of life, however, the results achieved by the devotees of the Lord and ordinary materialists are vastly different.</div>

Such a detached person desiring self-realization must approach the lotus feet of a bona fide spiritual master in Kåñëa consciousness, and then he will quickly come to the standard of perfect understanding. One who is seriously inclined toward spiritual perfection should not hesitate to adopt the regular discipline necessary for achieving the highest perfection in life.</div>

A devotee who has been blessed by his guru with spiritual knowledge becomes qualified to directly engage in the mission of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Çréla Prabhupäda always emphasized that service to the spiritual master in separation, pushing on the mission of the guru, is the highest form of devotional service. The word paricaret in this verse indicates waiting upon one's master by rendering personal service. In other words, one who has not clearly realized the teachings of his spiritual master should remain very close to the guru to avoid falling down into illusion, but one who has acquired realized knowledge by the mercy of his spiritual master may expand the spiritual master's mission by traveling around the world to preach Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="First"> It is clearly explained in this verse that loving devotional service unto Lord Kåñëa is the ultimate goal of the entire varëäçrama system, which the Lord has been elaborately explaining. In any social or occupational division of human society one must be a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and worship Him alone. The bona fide spiritual master is the representative of Lord Kåñëa, and worship of the äcärya goes directly to the lotus feet of the Lord. Although ordinary householders are sometimes ordered by Vedic injunctions to worship particular demigods or forefathers, one should remember that Lord Kåñëa is within all living entities. As stated here, sarva-bhüteñu mad-bhävaù. The pure devotees of the Lord worship the Lord alone, and those who cannot come to the standard of pure devotional service should at least meditate upon the Personality of Godhead within the demigods and all other living entities, understanding that all religious processes are ultimately meant for the pleasure of the Lord. In the course of missionary work even pure devotees must deal with government leaders and other prominent members of society, sometimes praising such persons and complying with their orders. Yet because the devotees are always meditating on Lord Kåñëa situated as the Supersoul within everyone, they are therefore acting for the Lord's pleasure and not for the pleasure of any ordinary human being. Those persons dealing with different demigods in the course of their varëäçrama duties should similarly see the Lord as the basis of everything. They should concentrate on pleasing the Supreme Lord by all activities. This stage of life is called love of God, and it brings one to the point of actual liberation.</div>

<div class="Chapnum"> 19. The Perfection of Spiritual Knowledge</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter describes how those who practice speculative knowledge eventually give up their method, whereas the pure devotees remain engaged in devotional service eternally. Also described are the different practices of the yogés, beginning with yama.</div>
<div class="First"> The Supreme Lord, Çré Kåñëa, stated to Uddhava, "One who is actually wise, who knows the truth of the self and possesses transcendental insight, rejects this world of dualities and the so-called knowledge meant for facilitating enjoyment of it. He instead engages himself in trying to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master of all. This is pure bhakti-yoga. Transcendental knowledge is greater than such ordinary pious activities as chanting of mantras, but pure devotional service is greater than even knowledge."</div>
<div class="First"> After this, Lord Kåñëa, requested by Çré Uddhava to describe in full detail pure transcendental knowledge and devotional service, related the same instructions that the greatest of Vaiñëavas, Bhéñmadeva, gave on these topics to Çré Yudhiñöhira on the occasion of the battle at Kurukñetra. Following this, after being asked about yama and the other practices of yoga, the Lord enumerated the twelve kinds of yama beginning with nonviolence, and the twelve kinds of niyama, beginning with bodily cleanliness.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: A self-realized person who has cultivated scriptural knowledge up to the point of enlightenment and who is free from impersonal speculation, understanding the material universe to be simply illusion, should surrender unto Me both that knowledge and the means by which he achieved it.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Mäyä-mätram idaà jïätvä indicates knowledge that the eternal spirit soul and the eternal Personality of Godhead are completely separate from the temporary qualities of the material world. The word vidyä-çruta-sampanna means that one should cultivate Vedic knowledge for the purpose of enlightenment and not to make a show of mysticism, intellectuality or impersonal speculation. Having neutralized the illusory effects of mäyä, one should then transfer one's attention to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, surrendering the process of philosophical negation to the Lord Himself. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé gives the example that when there is danger the king may issue weapons to private citizens, but after military victory the individual citizens return the weapons to the king.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains this point of this verse as follows. Somehow or other the living entity has to free himself from material illusion, which has covered him since time immemorial. Cultivating desirelessness and renunciation by practice of the mystic yoga system, the living entity develops knowledge of illusion and may thus lift himself above the reach of material ignorance. However, once one is situated on the transcendental platform, both knowledge of illusion and the process of acquiring such knowledge have no further practical application. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura gives the example that a man may be haunted by the ghost of a snake or a tiger. As long as the man is possessed and thinks, "I am a snake" or "I am a tiger," attempts will be made to counteract the ghostly influence by application of jewels, mantras and herbs. But when the man is freed from possession by ghosts, he again thinks, "I am Mr. So-and-so, the son of Mr. So-and-so," and returns to his original nature. At that time the jewels, mantras and herbs have no further immediate application. The word vidyä in this verse thus indicates knowledge acquired through philosophical analysis, mystic yoga, austerities and renunciation. Such knowledge of the temporary, illusory nature of this world counteracts ignorance, and there are many Vedic scriptures that train the living entity in such knowledge. Gradually one gives up his false identification with the material body and mind and with those material objects that interact with the body and mind. Having realized such counteractive knowledge, one must engage in the loving service of the Personality of Godhead and become a pure devotee. When one is completely perfect in Kåñëa consciousness, there is naturally little interest in the innumerable details of illusion, and gradually one is transferred to the spiritual world.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In the previous verse Lord Kåñëa stated that one should ultimately surrender unto Him that knowledge by which the material world is seen as illusion. Material attachments are certainly problems for the living entities, since they are diseases of the spirit soul. One who has contracted a skin disease that causes terrible itching gains only flickering relief by scratching the unbearable sores. If he does not scratch he suffers greatly, but by scratching, even though there is an instantaneous sensation of pleasure, unbearable misery follows as the itching increases. Real happiness is not found in scratching one's skin infections but rather in becoming free from such disease. Conditioned souls are harassed by many illusory desires, and in desperation they try to gratify their senses through the hopeless scratching processes of illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling and intoxication. They further try to gain relief through material society, friendship and love, but the result is unbearable suffering. Real happiness is to eliminate completely the itching disease of material desire. Since material desire is a disease of the soul, one must acquire knowledge to treat this disease and eliminate it. Such therapeutic knowledge is essential as long as one is diseased, but when one is fully healthy, such technical medical knowledge is no longer interesting to the healthy person, and he may leave such knowledge to the doctors. Similarly, in the advanced stage of Kåñëa consciousness one need not think continually of one's personal problems but may rather think of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa, with love and devotion. Lord Kåñëa advises in the previous verse that one should eliminate one's personal problems through technical knowledge of illusion. After giving up constant meditation on such problems, one can then become a lover of God. Lord Kåñëa certainly guides each and every sincere devotee internally within the heart and externally through the bona fide spiritual master. In this way, Lord Kåñëa gradually trains His sincere devotees to give up their irrational attachment to dead matter. Once freedom has been achieved, a devotee begins to seriously cultivate his relationship with Lord Kåñëa in the spiritual sky.</div>
<div class="First"> One may falsely think that just as at a certain stage of advancement one ceases to concentrate on technical, analytic knowledge of illusion, so, at another stage one may give up loving devotional service to Lord Kåñëa. To nullify such speculation Lord Çré Kåñëa here states in various ways that He is the supreme eternal goal of all truly learned human beings. Indeed, the most prominent scholars within the universe are the sages, such as the four Kumäras, who accept Lord Kåñëa as their only worshipable object. Because they have discovered that they are eternal fragmental portions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, they are not interested in fruitive activities and mental speculation. Lord Kåñëa awards celestial bliss and freedom from anxiety to His sincere followers, who have no purpose or beloved object in life other than the Lord.</div>

<div class="First"> The words padaà çreñöhaà vidur mama ("they recognize My lotus feet to be supreme") certainly eliminate the impersonalist philosophers from the category of saàsiddhäù, or completely perfected philosophers. Lord Kåñëa here refers to such great transcendental scholars as the four Kumäras, Çukadeva Gosvämé, Çré Vyäsadeva, Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura and Çréla A.C.

Just as a father is always proud of his son's education, similarly, Lord Kåñëa becomes very happy to see the living entities acquiring a sound spiritual education and thus making progress on the way back home, back to Godhead.</div>

One may perform penances or visit holy places with a proud menta!ity or material motivation; similarly, one may chant prayers to God, give charity or perform other externally pious activities with many bizarre, hypocritical or even demoniac motivations. Realized knowledge of the supremacy of Lord Kåñëa, however, is a solid connection with the spiritual world, and if one pursues this holy understanding one is gradually promoted to the highest level of conscious existence, called Vaikuëöha, or the kingdom of God.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The example is given that a man walking in the forest may see a rope but consider it to be a snake. Such perception is mäyä, or illusion, although the rope actually exists and a snake also exists in another place. Illusion thus refers to the false identification of one object with another. The material body exists briefly and then disappears. In the past the body did not exist, and in the future it will not exist; it enjoys a flickering, momentary existence in so-called present time. If we falsely identify ourselves as the material body or mind, we are creating an illusion. One who identifies himself as American, Russian, Chinese, Mexican, black or white, man or woman, communist or capitalist, and so on, accepting such designations as his permanent identity, is certainly in deep illusion. He can be compared to a sleeping man who sees himself acting in a different body while dreaming. In the previous verse Lord Kåñëa told Uddhava that spiritual knowledge is the means of achieving the highest perfection, and now the Lord is explicitly describing such knowledge.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa, recognizing Uddhava's highly intellectual nature, has repeatedly recommended to him that one should achieve perfection by cultivation of transcendental knowledge. But the Lord has also clearly demonstrated that such knowledge must bring one to the point of loving devotional service to Him, for otherwise it is useless. In this verse Çré Uddhava corroborates Lord Kåñëa's statements that actual happiness is obtained by surrendering to His lotus feet. When the incarnation of Godhead Påthu Mahäräja was crowned, the demigod Väyu presented him with an umbrella that constantly sprayed fine particles of water. The Lord's two lotus feet are similarly compared here to a wonderful umbrella that produces a constant shower of delicious nectar, the bliss of Kåñëa consciousness. Normally, speculative analytic knowledge terminates in an impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth, but the so-called bliss of merging into impersonal spiritual existence can never be compared to the bliss of Kåñëa consciousness, as stated here by Çré Uddhava. Kåñëa consciousness thus automatically constitutes perfect knowledge, since Lord Kåñëa is the ultimate shelter of all living entities. The words abhihatasya and abhivarñät are significant in this verse. Abhihatasya indicates one who is being defeated on all sides by the onslaught of material nature, whereas abhivarñät indicates a downpour of nectar that eliminates all of the problems of material existence. By our intelligence we should look beyond the dull material body and nonsensical material mind to observe the unlimited shower of blissful nectar coming from the two lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa. Then our real good fortune will begin.</div>

<div class="Translation"> O almighty Lord, please be merciful and uplift this hopeless living entity who has fallen into the dark hole of material existence, where the snake of time has bitten him. In spite of such abominable conditions, this poor living entity has tremendous desire to relish the most insignificant material happiness. Please save me, my Lord, by pouring down the nectar of Your instructions, which awaken one to spiritual freedom.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Material life, so much cherished by the nondevotees, is here compared to a dark hole filled with poisonous snakes. In material life there is certainly no clear understanding of one's ultimate identity, of God or of the universe. Everything is vague and dark. In material life the poisonous snake of time is always threatening, and at any moment our near and dear ones will be killed by the mortal fangs of the serpent. Ultimately, we ourselves will also be bitten and killed by the poisonous effects of time. The word sampatitam indicates that the falldown of the living entity is complete. In other words, he cannot get up again. Çré Uddhava therefore appeals to the Lord to be kind to these poor fallen souls, humbly represented by his own self. If one receives the Lord's mercy, then even without any further qualification one can go back home, back to Godhead; and without the mercy of Lord Kåñëa, the most learned, austere, powerful, wealthy or beautiful man will be pathetically crushed by the material world's machinery of illusion. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, as described here, is mahänubhäva, or the greatest, most powerful and most merciful personality, whose influence extends everywhere. The Lord's mercy is manifest in the form of His nectarean instructions such as Bhagavad-gétä and the Uddhava-gétä, being spoken here. The word kñudra-sukhoru-tarñam reveals the irony of material existence. Although material happiness is kñudra, or ridiculous and insignificant, our desire to enjoy it is uru, tremendous. Our disproportionate hankering to enjoy dead matter is certainly an illusory state of mind, and it gives us constant distress, keeping us bound up in the dark hole of material existence. Every living entity should put aside his false prestige based on ephemeral bodily qualifications and appeal sincerely to the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, for His mercy. The Lord hears every sincere appeal, from even the most fallen soul, and the effects of the Lord's mercy are wonderful. Although jïänés, yogés and fruitive workers are laboriously endeavoring to achieve their respective goals, their position is precarious and uncertain. Simply by achieving the mercy of Lord Kåñëa, however, one can very easily attain the highest perfection of life. If even one who is not a great or pure devotee of Lord Kåñëa sincerely appeals to the Lord for His mercy, the Lord is sure to give it generously.</div>

<div class="First"> The nine elements are material nature, the living entity, the mahat-tattva, false ego, and the five objects of sense perception, namely sound, touch, form, taste and aroma. The eleven elements are the five working senses (the voice, hands, legs, anus and genital) plus the five knowledge-acquiring senses (the ears, touch, eyes, tongue and nostrils), along with the coordinative sense, the mind. The five elements are the five physical elements, namely earth, water, fire, air and sky, and the three elements are the three modes of material nature—goodness, passion and ignorance. All living entities, from mighty Lord Brahmä down to an insignificant weed, manifest material bodies composed of these twenty-eight elements. The one element within all twenty-eight is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supersoul, who is all-pervading within the material and spiritual worlds. One can easily understand that the material universe is composed of innumerable causes and effects. Since Lord Kåñëa is the cause of all causes, all secondary causes and their effects are ultimately nondifferent from the Personality of Godhead. This understanding constitutes real knowledge, or jïäna, which is essential for perfecting one's life.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> When one no longer sees the twenty-eight separated material elements, which arise from a single cause, but rather sees the cause itself, the Personality of Godhead—at that time one's direct experience is called vijïäna, or self-realization.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The difference between jïäna (ordinary Vedic knowledge) and vijïäna (self-realization) can be understood as follows. A conditioned soul, although cultivating Vedic knowledge, continues to identify himself to some extent with the material body and mind and consequently with the material universe. In trying to understand the world he lives in, the conditioned soul learns through Vedic knowledge that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the one supreme cause of all material manifestations. He comes to understand the world around him, which he accepts more or less as his world. As he progresses in spiritual realization, breaking through the barrier of bodily identification, and realizes the existence of the eternal soul, he gradually identifies himself as part and parcel of the spiritual world, Vaikuëöha. At that time he is no longer interested in the Personality of Godhead merely as the supreme explanation of the material world; rather, he begins to reorient his entire mode of consciousness so that the central object of his attention is the Personality of Godhead. Such a reorientation is required, since the Supreme Lord is the factual center and cause of everything. A self-realized soul in the stage of vijïäna thus experiences the Personality of Godhead not merely as the creator of the material world but as the supreme living entity existing blissfully in His own eternal context. As one progresses in one's realization of the Supreme Lord in His own abode in the spiritual sky, one gradually becomes disinterested in the material universe and ceases to define the Supreme Lord in terms of His temporary manifestations. A self-realized soul in the stage of vijïäna is not at all attracted by objects that are created, maintained and ultimately destroyed. The stage of jïäna is the preliminary stage of knowledge for those still identifying themselves in terms of the material universe, whereas vijïäna is the mature stage of knowledge for those who see themselves as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Commencement, termination and maintenance are the stages of material causation. That which consistently accompanies all these material phases from one creation to another and remains alone when all material phases are annihilated is the one eternal.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The Lord here reiterates that the one Supreme Personality of Godhead is the basis of unlimited material variety. Material activity is a chain of cause-and-effect relationships by which innumerable objects are produced. A particular material effect is converted into a subsequent cause, and when the causal phase is terminated, the effect disappears. Fire causes firewood to burn to ashes, and when the causal function of fire is finished, fire itself, which was the effect of a previous cause, is also terminated. The simple fact is that all material objects are created, maintained and ultimately annihilated by the supreme potency of the Lord. And when the entire field of material cause and effect is withdrawn, so that all cause-effect relationships vanish, the Personality of Godhead remains in His own abode. Therefore, although innumerable objects may function as causes, they are not the ultimate or supreme cause. Only the Personality of Godhead is the absolute cause. Similarly, although material things may exist, they do not always exist. The Personality of Godhead alone has absolute existence. By the process of jïäna, or knowledge, one should understand the supreme position of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> From the four types of evidence—Vedic knowledge, direct experience, traditional wisdom and logical induction—one can understand the temporary, insubstantial situation of the material world, by which one becomes detached from the duality of this world.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In the çruti, or Vedic literature, it is clearly stated that everything emanates from the Absolute Truth, is maintained by the Absolute Truth and at the end is conserved within the Absolute Truth. Similarly, by direct experience we can observe the creation and destruction of great empires, cities, buildings, bodies and so on. Furthermore, we find all around the world traditional wisdom warning people that things in this world cannot last. Finally, by logical induction we can easily conclude that nothing in this world is permanent. Material sense gratification—up to the highest possible living standard found in the heavenly planets or down to the lowest conditions in the most repugnant precincts of hell—is always unsteady and prone to collapse at any moment. One should therefore develop vairägya, detachment, as stated here. Another meaning of this verse is that the four types of evidence cited here are often mutually contradictory in their description of the highest truth. One should therefore be detached from the duality of mundane evidence, including the portions of the Vedas that deal with the material world. Instead, one should accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the actual authority. Both in Bhagavad-gétä and here in Çrémad-Bhägavatam Lord Kåñëa is personally speaking, and thus there is no need to enter into the bewildering network of competing systems of mundane logic. One can directly hear from the Absolute Truth Himself and immediately acquire perfect knowledge. One thereby becomes detached from inferior systems of knowledge, which cause one to hover on the material mental platform.</div>

<div class="Translation"> An intelligent person should see that any material activity is subject to constant transformation and that even on the planet of Lord Brahmä there is thus simply unhappiness.

<div class="First"> The word adåñöam indicates the heavenly standard of life available in the higher planets within this universe. Such celestial neighborhoods are not actually experienced on the earth planet, although they are described in the Vedic literatures. One may argue that promotion to material heaven is recommended in the karma-käëòa portion of the Vedas and that although the happiness available there is not eternal, at least for some time one may enjoy life. Lord Kåñëa here states, however, that even on the planet of Lord Brahmä, which is superior to the heavenly planets, there is no happiness whatsoever. Even in the upper planetary systems there is rivalry, envy, irritation, lamentation and ultimately death itself.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Although Lord Kåñëa previously described bhakti-yoga to Çré Uddhava, Uddhava is not yet satisfied, because he loves Lord Kåñëa. Anyone who loves the Lord cannot be fully satiated by discussions of devotional service mixed with descriptions of mere Vedic duties and analytic philosophy. The supreme stage of conscious existence is pure love of Kåñëa, and one who is addicted to Lord Kåñëa desires to constantly drink the nectar of such topics. Lord Kåñëa has given an extensive survey of many aspects of human civilization, including the varëäçrama-dharma system and the processes of distinguishing between matter and spirit, renouncing sense gratification, and so forth. Now Uddhava is hankering to hear specifically about pure devotional service to Lord Kåñëa, and the Lord thus turns to that topic.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Firm faith in the blissful narration of My pastimes, constant chanting of My glories, unwavering attachment to ceremonial worship of Me, praising Me through beautiful hymns, great respect for My devotional service, offering obeisances with the entire body, performing first-class worship of My devotees, consciousness of Me in all living entities, offering of ordinary, bodily activities in My devotional service, use of words to describe My qualities, offering the mind to Me, rejection of all material desires, giving up wealth for My devotional service, renouncing material sense gratification and happiness, and performing all desirable activities such as charity, sacrifice, chanting, vows and austerities with the purpose of achieving Me—these constitute actual religious principles, by which those human beings who have actually surrendered themselves to Me automatically develop love for Me. What other purpose or goal could remain for My devotee?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The words mad-bhakta-püjäbhyadhikä are significant in this verse. Abhyadhikä indicates "superior quality." The Lord is extremely satisfied with those who offer worship to His pure devotees, and He rewards them accordingly. Because of the Lord's generous appraisal of His pure devotees, worship of the pure devotees is described as superior to worship of the Lord Himself. The words mad-artheñv aìga-ceñöä state that ordinary, bodily activities such as brushing the teeth, taking bath, eating, etc., should all be offered to the Supreme Lord as devotional service. The words vacasä mad-guëeraëam indicate that whether one speaks in ordinary, crude language or with learned poetic eloquence, one should describe the glories of the Personality of Godhead. The words mad-arthe 'rtha-parityägaù indicate that one should spend one's money for festivals glorifying the Personality of Godhead, such as Ratha-yäträ, Janmäñöamé and Gaura-pürëimä. Also, one is herein instructed to spend money to assist the mission of one's spiritual master and other Vaiñëavas. Wealth that cannot be used properly in the Lord's service and is thus an impediment to one's clear consciousness should be given up entirely. The word bhogasya refers to sense gratification, headed by sex enjoyment, and sukhasya refers to sentimental material happiness, such as excessive family attachment. The words dattaà hutam indicate that one should offer to brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas first-class foods cooked in ghee. One should offer the vibration svähä to Lord Viñëu in an authorized sacrificial fire along with grains and ghee. The word japtam indicates that one should constantly chant the holy names of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> When one's peaceful consciousness, strengthened by the mode of goodness, is fixed on the Personality of Godhead, one achieves religiosity, knowledge, detachment and opulence.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> A pure devotee becomes peaceful, çänta, by desiring everything for the service of the Lord and nothing for himself. He is strengthened by the transcendental, or purified, mode of goodness and thus achieves the supreme religious principle of directly serving the Lord. He also achieves jïäna, or knowledge of the Lord's form and his own spiritual body, detachment from material piety and sin, and the opulences of the spiritual world. One who is not a pure devotee of the Lord, however, but whose devotion is mixed with a fascination for mystic knowledge, is strengthened by the material mode of goodness. Through his meditation on the Lord he achieves the lesser results of dharma (piety in the mode of goodness), jïäna (knowledge of spirit and matter) and vairägya (detachment from the lower modes of nature). Ultimately, one should be a pure devotee of the Lord, since even the best the material world has to offer is most insignificant compared to the kingdom of God.</div>

<div class="First"> In the previous verse Lord Kåñëa explained the auspicious results of fixing the mind in Him, and now the opposite is explained. Rajas-valam indicates that one's passion grows so strong that one commits sinful activities and reaps all types of misfortune. Although materialistic people are blind to their impending wretchedness, one can confirm by all types of evidence—namely Vedic injunctions, direct observation, traditional wisdom and inductive logic—that the result of violating the laws of God is disastrous.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Absorbing the intelligence in Me constitutes mental equilibrium, and complete discipline of the senses is self-control. Tolerance means patiently enduring unhappiness, and steadfastness occurs when one conquers the tongue and genitals. The greatest charity is to give up all aggression toward others, and renunciation of lust is understood to be real austerity. Real heroism is to conquer one's natural tendency to enjoy material life, and reality is seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead everywhere. Truthfulness means to speak the truth in a pleasing way, as declared by great sages. Cleanliness is detachment in fruitive activities, whereas renunciation is the sannyäsa order of life. The true desirable wealth for human beings is religiousness, and I, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, am sacrifice. Religious remuneration is devotion to the äcärya with the purpose of acquiring spiritual instruction, and the greatest strength is the präëäyäma system of breath control.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa here describes those qualities that are desirable for persons advancing in human life. Çama, or "mental equilibrium," means to fix the intelligence in Lord Kåñëa. Mere peacefulness without Kåñëa consciousness is a dull and useless state of mind. Dama, or "discipline," means first to control one's own senses. If one wants to discipline one's children, disciples or followers without controlling one's own senses, one becomes a mere laughingstock. Tolerance means to patiently endure unhappiness, such as that provoked by the insults or negligence of others. One must also sometimes accept material inconvenience to carry out the injunctions of scriptures, and that unhappiness must also be patiently endured. If one is not tolerant of the insults and abuse of others, nor tolerant of the inconveniences that may arise from following authorized religious scriptures, it is simply foolishness for him to make a whimsical show of tolerating extreme heat, cold and pain and so on, just to impress others. Concerning steadfastness, if one does not control the tongue and genitals, then any other steadfastness is useless. Real charity means to renounce all aggression toward others. If one gives money to charitable causes but at the same time engages in exploitative business enterprises or abusive political tactics, one's charity is worth nothing at all. Austerity means to give up lust and sense gratification and to observe prescribed vows such as Ekädaçé; it does not mean inventing whimsical methods of torturing the material body. Real heroism is to conquer one's lower nature. Certainly everyone likes to propagate his own fame as a brilliant person, but everyone is also subject to lust, anger, greed and so forth. Therefore, if one can conquer these lower characteristics generated from the modes of passion and ignorance, one is a greater hero than those who merely destroy their political opponents through intrigue and violence.</div>
<div class="First"> One can develop equal vision by giving up jealousy and envy and by recognizing the existence of the soul within every material body. This attitude pleases the Supreme Lord, who then reveals Himself, solidifying forever one's equal vision. Merely describing things that exist does not constitute the last word in the perception of reality. One must also see the true spiritual equality of all living entities and all situations. Truthfulness means that one should speak in a pleasing way so that there will be a beneficial effect. If one becomes attached to pointing out the faults of others in the name of truth, then such faultfinding will not be appreciated by saintly persons. The bona fide spiritual master speaks the truth in such a way that people can elevate themselves to the spiritual platform, and one should learn this art of truthfulness. If one is attached to material things, his body and mind are understood to be always polluted. Cleanliness therefore means to give up material attachment, not merely to frequently rinse one's skin with water. Real renunciation is giving up one's false sense of proprietorship over one's relatives and wife, and not just giving away material objects, while real wealth is to be religious. Sacrifice is the Personality of Godhead Himself, because the performer of sacrifice, to be successful, must absorb his consciousness in the Personality of Godhead and not in temporary, material rewards that may accrue from sacrifice. Real religious remuneration means that one should serve saintly persons who can enlighten one with spiritual knowledge. One may offer remuneration to his spiritual master, who has enlightened him, by distributing the same knowledge to others, thereby pleasing the äcärya. Preaching work thus constitutes the highest form of remuneration. By performing the präëäyäma system of respiratory control, one can easily subdue the mind, and one who can in this way perfectly control the restless mind is the most powerful person.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Actual opulence is My own nature as the Personality of Godhead, through which I exhibit the six unlimited opulences. The supreme gain in life is devotional service to Me, and actual education is nullifying the false perception of duality within the soul. Real modesty is to be disgusted with improper activities, and beauty is to possess good qualities such as detachment. Real happiness is to transcend material happiness and unhappiness, and real misery is to be implicated in searching for sex pleasure. A wise man is one who knows the process of freedom from bondage, and a fool is one who identifies with his material body and mind. The real path in life is that which leads to Me, and the wrong path is sense gratification, by which consciousness is bewildered. Actual heaven is the predominance of the mode of goodness, whereas hell is the predominance of ignorance. I am everyone's true friend, acting as the spiritual master of the entire universe, and one's home is the human body. My dear friend Uddhava, one who is enriched with good qualities is actually said to be rich, and one who is unsatisfied in life is actually poor. A wretched person is one who cannot control his senses, whereas one who is not attached to sense gratification is a real controller. One who attaches himself to sense gratification is the opposite, a slave. Thus, Uddhava, I have elucidated all of the matters about which you inquired. There is no need for a more elaborate description of these good and bad qualities, since to constantly see good and bad is itself a bad quality. The best quality is to transcend material good and evil.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The Supreme Personality of Godhead is naturally full of six opulences, namely unlimited beauty, wealth, fame, knowledge, strength and renunciation. Therefore the greatest profit in life is to achieve personal loving service to the Lord, who is naturally the reservoir of all pleasure. Real education means to give up the false idea that anything is separate from the Lord, the source of all potencies. Similarly, one should not falsely consider the individual soul to be different or separate from the Supreme Soul. Mere bashfulness does not constitute modesty. One should spontaneously withdraw in disgust from sinful activities; then one is actually modest or humble. One who is satisfied in Kåñëa consciousness and thus does not seek material pleasure or suffer material unhappiness is considered to be actually situated in happiness. The most wretched person is one addicted to sex pleasure, and a wise man is one who knows the process of freedom from such material bondage. A fool is one who gives up his eternal friendship with Lord Kåñëa and instead identifies himself with his own temporary material body, mind, society, community and family. The real path in life is not simply a modern interstate highway or, in more simple cultures, a footpath free of thorns and mud. It is that path that leads to Lord Kåñëa. The wrong path in life is not simply a road having many thieves or tollbooths; it is that path that leads one to utter confusion in material sense gratification. A heavenly situation is that in which the mode of goodness predominates, rather than that found on the planet of Indra, where passion and ignorance sometimes disturb the celestial atmosphere. Hell is anywhere the mode of ignorance is predominant, and not merely the hellish planets, where, according to Lord Çiva, a pure devotee can think of Kåñëa and remain happy. Our actual friend in life is the bona fide spiritual master, who saves us from all dangers. Among all gurus, Lord Kåñëa is Himself the jagat-guru, or spiritual master of the entire universe. In material life our own material body is our immediate home, rather than some structure of bricks, cement, stone and wood. A rich man is one who possesses innumerable good qualities; he is not a neurotic fool with a large bank account. A poor man is one who is unsatisfied, which is self-explanatory. One who cannot control his senses is certainly wretched and miserable in life, whereas one who detaches himself from material life is actually a lord or controller. In modern times there are remnants of aristocracy in Europe and other countries, but such so-called lords often display the habits of lower forms of life. A real lord is one who conquers material existence by rising to the spiritual platform. A person who is attached to material life will undoubtedly manifest the opposites of all the good qualities mentioned here, and he is thus the symbol of going backward in life. The Lord concludes His analysis by stating that there is no need for further elaboration of these good and bad qualities. Indeed, the purpose of life is to transcend materially good and bad qualities and come to the liberated platform of pure Kåñëa consciousness. This point will be further explained in the following chapter.</div>
<div class="First"> Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Nineteenth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Perfection of Spiritual Knowledge."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 20. Pure Devotional Service Surpasses Knowledge and</div>
<div class="First"> Detachment</div>
<div class="First"> The processes of karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga and bhakti-yoga are explained in this chapter, in terms of the presence of different good and bad qualities in particular candidates.</div>
<div class="First"> The Vedic çästras are the words expressing the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In these Vedic literatures is found an outlook of duality, based on such concepts as the varëäçrama system, and at the same time the Vedas reject this dualistic vision. Uddhava, desiring to understand the reason why the scriptures contain such conflicting ideas, and how these might be reconciled, inquired from Lord Çré Kåñëa about this matter. In response the Supreme Lord replied that the Vedas describe the processes of karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga and bhakti-yoga for facilitating the attainment of liberation. Karma-yoga is designated for those persons who are not detached and who are full of gross desires; jïäna-yoga is for those who are detached from the fruits of activity and have given up material endeavors; and bhakti-yoga is for those persons who have taken to the principle of yukta-vairägya, appropriate renunciation. As long as one has not become uninterested in enjoying the fruits of one's work, or as long as one's faith in the topics of discussion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead on the path of devotional service has not awakened, then one must continue to fulfill all the prescribed duties of his karma. But neither the renunciant nor the devotee of the Supreme Lord need carry out ritualistic duties.</div>
<div class="First"> Persons who follow their own duty, who abandon that which is forbidden and who are free from greed and other unhealthy characteristics attain either monistic knowledge or else, if they are fortunate, devotion to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such knowledge and devotion can be achieved in the human form of life, which is therefore a desirable object both for those living in hell and for the demigods. The human body, even though it awards the whole purpose of existence in the form of knowledge and devotion, is ephemeral; therefore one who is discriminating should soberly strive for liberation before death comes. The human body is like a boat, Çré Gurudeva is the helmsman, and the mercy of the Supreme Lord is the favorable breeze. If the person who has attained such a rare boat in the form of the human body does not desire to cross over the ocean of material existence, he is in fact the killer of the soul. The mind is fickle, but one should not indifferently allow it to act as it will. Rather, one should conquer the senses and the vital air and by intelligence endowed with the qualities of goodness should bring the mind under control.</div>
<div class="First"> Until the mind finally becomes stable, one should continue to meditate about the process of the creation of all material things in sequence from subtle to gross and of their destruction in reverse sequence of gross to subtle. One who has a sense of detachment and renunciation can give up false identification with the body and other sense objects by constantly studying the instructions of his spiritual master. By the yoga practice of yama, niyama and so forth, by cultivation of transcendental knowledge and by worship of and meditation upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can remember the Supersoul.</div>
<div class="First"> Virtue, or guëa, means to remain steadfast in the object of one's particular platform of qualification. By developing the desire to reject one's accumulated material association by pursuing the injunctions of what is good and what is bad, all of one's inauspicious material activities become diminished. By devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead all perfections are achieved. Anyone who renders service to the Supreme Lord by constant devotional service will be able to steadily fix his mind upon the Supreme Lord, and thus all desires for sense gratification sitting within the heart will be destroyed to the root. When one directly perceives the presence of the Supreme Lord, his false ego becomes completely eradicated; all of his doubts are shattered, and heaps of material activities become diminished to nil. For this reason the devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead do not consider knowledge and renunciation to be the means for achieving the highest benefit. Only in the heart of a person who is devoid of material desire and disinterested in material things can devotional service to the Lord arise. The piety and impiety that result from ritualistic injunctions and prohibitions cannot be applied to the unalloyed pure devotees of the Supreme Lord.</div>

<div class="First"> At the end of the previous chapter, Lord Kåñëa stated, guëa-doña-dåçir doño guëas tübhaya-varjitaù: "Focusing upon material piety and sin is itself a discrepancy, since actual piety means to transcend both of them." Çré Uddhava now pursues this point so that Lord Kåñëa will give a more elaborate explanation of this difficult subject matter. Çré Uddhava here states that the Vedic literatures, which constitute the laws of God, deal with piety and sin; therefore, it must be clarified how one transcends activities recommended in the Vedas. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, Uddhava suddenly understood Lord Kåñëa's purpose in the words He had just spoken, and to induce the Lord to elaborate upon this interesting point Uddhava outwardly challenged the Lord's statement.</div>

<div class="Translation"> According to Vedic literature, the superior and inferior varieties found in the human social system, varëäçrama, are due to pious and sinful modes of family planning. Thus piety and sin are constant points of reference in the Vedic analysis of the components of a given situation—namely the material ingredients, place, age and time. Indeed, the Vedas reveal the existence of material heaven and hell, which are certainly based on piety and sin.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Pratiloma indicates the combination of a superior woman with an inferior man. For example, the vaidehaka community consists of those born of a çüdra father and brähmaëa mother, whereas the sütas are those born from a kñatriya father and a brähmaëa mother or from a çüdra father and kñatriya mother. Anuloma indicates those born from a superior father and inferior mother. The mürdhävasikta are those born of a brähmaëa father and kñatriya mother. Ambañöhas are those born from a brähmaëa father and vaiçya mother, and they often become medical men. Karaëa indicates those born of a vaiçya father and çüdra mother or of a kñatriya father and vaiçya mother. That such mixing of castes is not very much appreciated in the Vedic culture is demonstrated in the first chapter of Bhagavad-gétä. Arjuna was very worried that the death of so many kñatriyas on the battlefield would lead to the mixing of superior women with inferior men, and on those grounds he objected to fighting. In any case, the entire Vedic social system is based on distinguishing between piety and sin, and Çré Uddhava is encouraging the Lord to explain more elaborately His statement that one should transcend both piety and sin.</div>

<div class="First"> One might argue that while human beings are certainly prone to ignorance, the elevated forefathers and demigods are considered to be all-knowing within universal affairs. If such superior beings would communicate with the earth, then everyone could bypass Vedic knowledge in achieving his personal desire. This concept is denied here by the words vedaç cakñuù. Even the demigods and forefathers have at best an ambiguous conception of supreme liberation, and even in material affairs they are subject to personal frustration. Although the demigods are all-powerful in awarding material benedictions to inferior species such as human beings, they are sometimes thwarted in their personal programs of sense gratification. A rich businessman, for example, may have no difficulty paying the insignificant salary of one of his innumerable workers, but the same wealthy man may be completely frustrated in his dealings with his own family and friends and may also be defeated in his attempts to expand his fortune by further investments. Although a rich man appears to be all-powerful to his subordinate workers, he must personally struggle to fulfill his personal desires. Similarly, the demigods and forefathers encounter many difficulties in maintaining and expanding their celestial standard of living. They must therefore constantly take shelter of superior Vedic knowledge. Even in the administration of cosmic affairs, they strictly follow the guidelines of the Vedas, which are the laws of God. If such fabulous entities as demigods must take shelter of the Vedas, we can just imagine the position of human beings, who are frustrated at virtually every step of their lives. Every human being should accept Vedic knowledge as the highest evidence in material and spiritual affairs. Uddhava points out to the Lord that if one accepts the authority of Vedic knowledge, it is seemingly impossible to reject the concept of material piety and sin. Thus Uddhava persists in examining the Lord's controversial statement at the end of the last chapter.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear Lord, the distinction observed between piety and sin comes from Your own Vedic knowledge and does not arise by itself. If the same Vedic literature subsequently nullifies such distinction between piety and sin, there will certainly be confusion.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In the Bhagavad-gétä (15.15) Lord Kåñëa states, vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù: "By all the Vedas I am to be known. Indeed, I am the compiler of Vedanta, and I know the Veda as it is." Vedic knowledge emanates from the breathing of the Personality of Godhead; therefore, whatever Lord Kåñëa speaks is Veda, or perfect knowledge. The Vedic literatures are full of descriptions of piety and sin, but Lord Kåñëa's statement that one should transcend piety and sin is also to be understood as Vedic knowledge. Çré Uddhava has understood this point and therefore requests Lord Kåñëa to clear up an apparent contradiction. Ultimately, the material world gives the living entities a chance to satisfy their perverted desires and at the same time gradually achieve the liberation of going back home, back to Godhead. Thus material piety must be considered a means and never an absolute end, since the material world itself is not absolute, being temporary and limited. The Personality of Godhead is Himself the reservoir of all virtue and goodness. Those persons and activities that please the Lord are to be considered virtuous, and those that displease Him are to be considered sinful. There cannot be any other permanent definition of these terms. If one becomes a mundane moralist, forgetting the Supreme Lord, one's position is certainly imperfect, and one will not achieve the ultimate goal of piety, going back home, back to Godhead. On the other hand, there is great fear among moralists that if the distinction between piety and sin is minimized, people will commit many atrocities in the name of God. In the modern world there is no clear understanding of spiritual authority, and moral men consider any appeal to transcend morality to be an invitation to fanaticism, anarchy, violence and corruption. Thus they regard material moral principles as more important than directly trying to please God. Because this point is controversial, Uddhava is anxiously requesting the Lord to give a clear explanation.</div>

Besides these three there is absolutely no other means of elevation.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Ultimately, the goal of philosophical speculation, pious regulated work and devotional service is the same—Kåñëa consciousness. As stated by the Lord in</div>

<div class="First"> "All of them—as they surrender unto Me—I reward accordingly. Everyone follows My path in all respects, O son of Påthä." Although all authorized processes of human perfection ultimately lead to Kåñëa consciousness, or love of God, various performers have specific propensities and qualifications and thus gravitate to different methods of self-realization. Lord Kåñëa here describes the three authorized processes together in order to emphasize that their ultimate goal is one. At the same time, philosophical speculation and regulated pious work can never be considered equal to pure love of Godhead, as the Lord has elaborately clarified in the previous chapters. The word trayaù, or "three," indicates that despite their ultimate oneness of purpose, the three paths display diversity in progress and achievement. One cannot achieve the same result by mere speculation or piety that one achieves by directly surrendering to the Personality of Godhead, depending completely on His mercy and friendship. The word karma here indicates work dedicated to the Personality of Godhead. As described in Bhagavad-gétä (3.9),</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yajïärthät karmaëo 'nyatra</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">loko 'yaà karma-bandhanaù</div>

<div class="First"> "Work done as a sacrifice for Viñëu has to be performed, otherwise work binds one to this material world. Therefore, O son of Kunté, perform your prescribed duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always remain unattached and free from bondage." In the process of jïäna, one seeks impersonal liberation by merging into the glaring effulgence of the Personality of Godhead. Such liberation is considered hellish by the devotees, because by merging one loses all awareness of the supreme blissful feature of the Lord as Bhagavän, the supreme person. The performers of karma, or regulated work, seek the three aspects of human progress other than liberation—namely religiosity, economic development and sense gratification. The fruitive workers think that by exhausting each of their innumerable material desires they will gradually come out of the dark tunnel of material existence into the clear light of spiritual liberation. This process is very dangerous and uncertain, because not only is there virtually no limit to material desires, but even a slight flaw in the process of regulated work constitutes sin and throws one off the path of progressive life. The devotees directly aim for love of Godhead and are therefore most pleasing to the Supreme Lord. In any case, all three divisions of Vedic elevation depend completely on the mercy of Lord Kåñëa. One cannot progress along any one of these paths without the blessings of the Lord. Other Vedic processes, such as austerity, charity and so forth, are included within the three primary divisions described here.</div>

<div class="First"> In this verse the Lord reveals the different propensities that lead human beings to adopt different processes of perfection. Those who are frustrated in the ordinary material life of society, friendship and love, and who understand that promotion to heaven simply brings further domestic miseries, take directly to the path of knowledge. Through authorized philosophical discrimination they transcend the bonds of material existence. Those who are still desirous of enjoying material society, friendship and love, and who are excited by the prospect of going with their relatives to material heavenly planets, cannot take directly to the path of rigorous philosophical advancement, which requires great austerity. Such persons are advised to remain in family life and offer the fruits of their work to the Supreme. In this way, they also can become perfect and gradually learn detachment from material life.</div>

As mentioned in the previous verse, those who become disgusted with material life take to impersonal philosophical speculation and rigorously try to stamp out any trace of personal existence. Those who are still attached to material sense gratification try to purify themselves by offering the fruits of their ordinary activities to the Supreme. A first-class candidate for pure devotional service, on the other hand, is neither completely disgusted with nor attached to material life. He does not desire to pursue ordinary material existence any further, because it cannot award real happiness. Nevertheless, a candidate for devotional service does not give up all hope for perfecting personal existence. A person who avoids the two extremes of material attachment and impersonal reaction to material attachment and who somehow or other gets the association of pure devotees, faithfully hearing their message, is a good candidate for going back home, back to Godhead, as described here by the Lord.</div>

The devotee thus becomes fearless by meditating on the Lord's promise of protection. Those, however, who are materially attached are frightened by the prospect of full surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, thereby revealing their inimical mentality toward the Lord.</div>

According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, through transcendental knowledge one obtains liberation, whereas through pure devotional service one can achieve love of Godhead, in which liberation is automatically included. Both results are certainly superior to ordinary, fruitive activities, by which one tries to enjoy much the same things that animals do. If one's devotional service is mixed with a tendency toward fruitive activities or mental speculation, then one may achieve the neutral stage of love of Godhead, whereas those who are inclined to serve only Lord Kåñëa advance to the higher stages of love of Godhead in servitude, friendship, parental love and the conjugal relationship.</div>

<div class="First"> One who has achieved human life on the earth has an excellent opportunity to attain spiritual liberation through Kåñëa consciousness, or devotional service to the Lord. Thus one should not desire promotion to heaven or risk residence in hell, where excessive enjoyment or punishment deviate one's mind from self-realization.

Now the Lord explains that promotion to heavenly planets (the final goal of piety) as well as residence in hell (the result of sinful activities) are both useless in fulfilling the actual purpose of life. Neither material piety nor sin establish the eternal living entity in his constitutional position; therefore something more is required to achieve the actual perfection of life.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The human body, which can award all benefit in life, is automatically obtained by the laws of nature, although it is a very rare achievement. This human body can be compared to a perfectly constructed boat having the spiritual master as the captain and the instructions of the Personality of Godhead as favorable winds impelling it on its course. Considering all these advantages, a human being who does not utilize his human life to cross the ocean of material existence must be considered the killer of his own soul.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The human body, which is obtained after passing through many inferior forms, is created in such a way that it can award the highest perfection of life. A human being is supposed to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the bona fide spiritual master is the appropriate guide for such service. The causeless mercy of Lord Kåñëa is compared to favorable winds that help the boat of the body to ply smoothly on the course back home, back to Godhead. Lord Kåñëa gives His personal instructions in Vedic literature, speaks through the bona fide spiritual master, and encourages, warns and protects His sincere devotee from within the devotee's heart. Such merciful guidance of the Lord moves a sincere soul quickly on the path back to Godhead. But one who cannot understand that the human body is a suitable boat for crossing the ocean of material existence will see no need to accept a captain in the form of the spiritual master and will not at all appreciate the favorable winds of the Lord's mercy. He has no chance of achieving the goal of human life. Acting against his own self-interest, he gradually becomes the killer of his own soul.</div>

<div class="First"> Although one is seriously engaging the mind in Kåñëa consciousness, the mind is so flickering that it may suddenly be deviated from its spiritual position. One should then carefully bring the mind back under the control of the self. It is stated in Bhagavad-gétä that if one is too austere or too sensuous one cannot control the mind. Sometimes one may bring the mind under control by allowing the material senses limited satisfaction. For example, although one may eat austerely, from time to time one may accept a reasonable amount of mahä-prasädam, opulent foods offered to the temple Deities, so that the mind will not become disturbed. Similarly, one may occasionally relax with other transcendentalists through joking, swimming and so forth. But if such activities are performed excessively, they will lead to a setback in spiritual life. When the mind desires sinful gratification such as illicit sex or intoxication, one must simply tolerate the mind's foolishness and by strenuous effort push on with Kåñëa consciousness. Then the waves of illusion will soon subside, and the path of advancement will again open wide.</div>

The best solution is to keep the mind always busy in the service of Lord Kåñëa so that the mind cannot wander onto the dangerous path of sense gratification, headed by sex attraction. The material mind is naturally inclined to accept material objects at every moment. Therefore unless the mind is seriously brought under control there is no possibility of becoming steady on the path of spiritual advancement.</div>

<div class="First"> Just as an expert rider intimately knows the propensities of an untamed horse and gradually brings the horse under control, an expert yogé allows the mind to reveal its materialistic propensities and then controls them through superior intelligence. A learned transcendentalist withholds and supplies sense objects so that the mind and senses remain fully controlled, just as the horseman sometimes pulls sharply on the reins and sometimes allows the horse to run freely. The rider never forgets his actual goal or destination, and eventually places the horse on the right path. Similarly, a learned transcendentalist, even though sometimes allowing the senses to act, never forgets the goal of self-realization, nor does he allow the senses to engage in sinful activity.

The material mind may be attracted to sex; therefore by spiritual intelligence one should scrutinize the temporary nature of one's own body and the body that has artificially become the object of one's material lust. One may apply this rigid analysis to all material bodies, from the fantastic cosmic body of Lord Brahmä down to that of the most insignificant germ. As previously stated by Lord Kåñëa, one who is advanced in Kåñëa consciousness spontaneously avoids sense gratification and is constantly drawn by spiritual love into his relationship with Lord Kåñëa. One who has not achieved the platform of spontaneous Kåñëa consciousness must remain constantly vigilant so as not to be grossly cheated by the material energy of the Lord.

It should be clearly understood that the word aàhas, or "sin," here refers to an accidental falldown against one's desire. Premeditated exploitation of the mercy of the Lord can never be excused.</div>
<div class="First"> Significantly, the Lord forbids any extraneous purificatory rites, since the transcendental yoga systems are themselves the most purifying processes, especially bhakti-yoga. If one gives up one's regular prescribed duties to perform a special ritual or penance, trying to purify a sinful reaction, then one will be guilty of the additional fault of giving up one's prescribed duties. One should pick oneself up from an accidental falldown and go on vigorously with one's prescribed duties in life without being unnecessarily discouraged. One should certainly lament and feel ashamed, or there will be no purification. However, if one becomes overly depressed at an accidental falldown one will not have the enthusiasm to go on to perfection. Lord Kåñëa also states in the</div>

One who adopts this standard of piety and sin, sincerely desiring to give up all past association with sense gratification, is able to subdue materialistic activities, which are by nature impure.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa here explains more clearly that those persons directly engaged in self-realization either through jïäna-yoga or bhakti-yoga need not give up their regular duties and perform special penances to atone for an accidental falldown. The actual purpose of Vedic literature is to direct one back home, back to Godhead, and not to encourage material sense gratification. Although the Vedas recommend innumerable rituals for promotion to heavenly planets and enjoyment of all varieties of material opulence, such materialistic rewards are meant only to engage materialistic people, who otherwise would become demoniac. To purify an accidental falldown, one who is engaged in transcendental realization need not adopt any procedure beyond his own spiritual practice. The words saìgänäà tyäjanecchayä indicate that one should not practice Kåñëa consciousness or self-realization superficially or casually; rather, one should sincerely and earnestly desire freedom from one's past sinful life. Similarly, the words yä niñöhä indicate that one must constantly practice Kåñëa consciousness. Thus, essential piety is to give up material sense gratification and engage in the loving service of the Lord. One who engages his senses, mind and intelligence twenty-four hours a day in the Lord's service is the most pious person, and the Lord personally protects such a surrendered soul.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Having awakened faith in the narrations of My glories, being disgusted with all material activities, knowing that all sense gratification leads to misery, but still being unable to renounce all sense enjoyment, My devotee should remain happy and worship Me with great faith and conviction. Even though he is sometimes engaged in sense enjoyment, My devotee knows that all sense gratification leads to a miserable result, and he sincerely repents such activities.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The beginning stage of pure devotional service is described here by the Lord. A sincere devotee has practically seen that all material activities lead only to sense gratification and all sense gratification leads only to misery. Thus a devotee's sincere desire is to engage twenty-four hours a day in the loving service of Lord Kåñëa without any personal motivation. The devotee sincerely desires to be established in his constitutional position as the Lord's eternal servitor, and he prays to the Lord to elevate him to this exalted position. The word anéçvara indicates that because of one's past sinful activities and bad habits one may not immediately be able to completely extinguish the enjoying spirit. The Lord here encourages such a devotee not to be overly depressed or morose but to remain enthusiastic and to go on with his loving service. The word nirviëëa indicates that a sincere devotee, although somewhat entangled in the remnants of sense gratification, is completely disgusted with material life and under no circumstances willingly commits sinful activities. In fact, he avoids every kind of materialistic activity. The word kämän basically refers to sex attraction and its by-products in the form of children, home and so forth. Within the material world, the sex impulse is so strong that even a sincere candidate in the loving service of the Lord may sometimes be disturbed by sex attraction or by lingering sentiments for wife and children. A pure devotee certainly feels spiritual affection for all living entities, including the so-called wife and children, but he knows that material bodily attraction leads to no good, for it simply entangles one and one's so-called relatives in a miserable chain reaction of fruitive activities. The word dåòha-niçcaya ("steadfast conviction") indicates that in any circumstance a devotee is completely determined to go on with his prescribed duties for Kåñëa. Thus he thinks, "By my previous shameful life my heart is polluted with many illusory attachments. Personally I have no power to stop them. Only Lord Kåñëa within my heart can remove such inauspicious contamination. But whether the Lord removes such attachments immediately or lets me go on being afflicted by them, I will never give up my devotional service to Him. Even if the Lord places millions of obstacles in my path, and even if because of my offenses I go to hell, I will never for a moment stop serving Lord Kåñëa. I am not interested in mental speculation and fruitive activities; even if Lord Brahmä personally comes before me offering such engagements, I will not be even slightly interested. Although I am attached to material things I can see very clearly that they lead to no good because they simply give me trouble and disturb my devotional service to the Lord. Therefore, I sincerely repent my foolish attachments to so many material things, and I am patiently awaiting Lord Kåñëa's mercy." The word préta indicates that a devotee feels exactly like the son or subject of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is very attached to his relationship with the Lord. Therefore, although sincerely lamenting occasional lapses into sense enjoyment, he never gives up his enthusiasm to serve Lord Kåñëa. If a devotee becomes too morose or discouraged in devotional service, he may drift into an impersonal consciousness or give up his devotional service to the Lord. Therefore, the Lord here advises that although one should sincerely repent, he should not become chronically depressed. One should understand that because of his past sins he must occasionally suffer disturbances from the material mind and senses, but one should not therefore become a devotee of detachment, as do the speculative philosophers. Although one may desire detachment to purify one's devotional service to the Lord, if one becomes more concerned with renunciation than with acting for the pleasure of Lord Kåñëa, he is misunderstanding the position of loving devotional service. Faith in Lord Kåñëa is so powerful that in due course of time it will automatically award detachment and perfect knowledge. If one gives up Lord Kåñëa as the central object of one's worship and concentrates more on knowledge and detachment, one will become deviated from one's progress in going back home, back to Godhead. A sincere devotee of the Lord must be sincerely convinced that simply by the strength of devotional service and the mercy of Lord Kåñëa he will achieve everything auspicious in life. One must believe that Lord Kåñëa is all-merciful and that He is the only real goal of one's life. Such determined faith combined with a sincere desire to give up sense enjoyment will carry one past the obstacles of this world.</div>
<div class="First"> The words jäta-çraddhaù mat-kathäsu are most significant here. By faithful hearing of the mercy and glories of the Lord one will gradually be freed from all material desire and clearly see at every moment the utter frustration of sense gratification. Chanting the glories of the Lord with firm faith and conviction is a tremendously powerful spiritual process that enables one to give up all material association.</div>
<div class="First"> There is actually nothing inauspicious in the devotional service of the Lord. Occasional difficulties experienced by a devotee are due to his previous material activities. On the other hand, the endeavor for sense gratification is completely inauspicious. Thus sense gratification and devotional service are directly opposed to each other. In all circumstances one should therefore remain the Lord's sincere servant, always believing in His mercy. Then one will certainly go back home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation"> When an intelligent person engages constantly in worshiping Me through loving devotional service as described by Me, his heart becomes firmly situated in Me. Thus all material desires within the heart are destroyed.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The material senses are engaged in gratifying the concoctions of the mind, causing many types of material desires to become prominent, one after another. One who constantly engages in the devotional service of the Lord by hearing and chanting the Lord's transcendental glories with firm faith gets relief from the harassment of material desires. By serving the Lord one becomes strengthened in the conviction that Çré Kåñëa is the only actual enjoyer and all others are meant to share the Lord's pleasure through devotional service. A devotee of the Lord situates Çré Kåñëa on a beautiful throne within his heart and there offers the Lord constant service. Just as the rising sun gradually eliminates all trace of darkness, the Lord's presence within the heart causes all material desires there to weaken and eventually disappear. The words mayi hådi sthite ("when the heart is situated in Me") indicate that an advanced devotee sees Lord Kåñëa not only within his own heart but within the hearts of all living creatures. Thus a sincere devotee who chants and hears the glories of Çré Kåñëa should not be discouraged by the remnants of material desires within the heart. He should faithfully wait for the devotional process to naturally purify the heart of all contamination.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The knot in the heart is pierced, all misgivings are cut to pieces and the chain of fruitive actions is terminated when I am seen as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Hådaya-granthi indicates that one's heart is bound to illusion by false identification with the material body. One thus becomes absorbed in material sex pleasure, dreaming of innumerable combinations of male and female bodies. A person intoxicated by sex attraction cannot understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the reservoir of all pleasure and the supreme enjoyer. When a devotee achieves steadiness in devotional service, feeling transcendental pleasure at every moment in the execution of his loving service to the Lord, the knot of false identification is pierced and all his misgivings are cut to pieces. In illusion we imagine that the living entity cannot be fully satisfied without material sense gratification and speculative doubting of the Absolute Truth. Materialistic persons consider sense enjoyment and speculative doubting to be essential for civilized life. A pure devotee, however, realizes that Lord Kåñëa is an unlimited ocean of happiness and the personification of all knowledge. This realization of Lord Kåñëa completely eradicates the twin tendencies of sense gratification and mental speculation. Thus the chain of fruitive activities, or karma, automatically collapses, just as a fire collapses and goes out when its fuel is removed. Advanced devotional service automatically awards one liberation from material bondage, as confirmed by Lord Kapila: jarayaty äçu yä koçaà nigérëam analo yathä. "Bhakti, devotional service, dissolves the subtle body of the living entity without separate effort, just as fire in the stomach digests all that we eat." (SB 3.25.33) Çréla Prabhupäda states in his purport to this verse, "A devotee does not have to try separately to attain liberation. That very service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the process of liberation, because to engage oneself in the service of the Lord is to liberate oneself from material entanglement. Çré Bilvamaìgala Öhäkura explained this position very nicely. He said, 'If I have unflinching devotion unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, then mukti, or liberation, serves me as my maidservant. Mukti the maidservant is always ready to do whatever I ask.' For a devotee, liberation is no problem at all. Liberation takes place without separate endeavor."</div>

<div class="Translation"> Therefore, for a devotee engaged in My loving service, with mind fixed on Me, the cultivation of knowledge and renunciation is generally not the means of achieving the highest perfection within this world.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> A surrendered devotee of Lord Kåñëa does not seek perfection through the cultivation of knowledge and renunciation outside the loving service of the Lord. Devotional service to Lord Kåñëa, being itself the supreme transcendental process, never depends upon the secondary methods involving the cultivation of knowledge and renunciation. By chanting and hearing the glories of the Personality of Godhead a devotee automatically realizes all knowledge, and as the devotee's attachment to the Lord increases, he automatically gives up attachment for the inferior material nature. The Lord has explicitly declared in the previous verses that a devotee should not try to solve his lingering problems by means other than devotional service. Although a sincere devotee has surrendered heart and soul in loving service to the Lord, there may be lingering material attachments that prevent the devotee from perfectly realizing transcendental knowledge. Devotional service, however, will automatically eradicate such lingering attachments in due course of time. If the devotee tries to purify himself through cultivation of knowledge and renunciation, which fall outside the scope of devotional service, there is danger of his being deviated from the Lord's lotus feet and falling down completely from the transcendental path. One who endeavors for purification outside the loving service of the Lord has not actually understood the transcendental potency of bhakti-yoga and does not appreciate the extent of Lord Kåñëa's mercy.</div>
<div class="First"> Within this world one's heart is bound by sex attraction, which disturbs one's meditation on the lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa. Intoxicated by contact with women, the conditioned soul becomes artificially proud and forgets his loving servitude to the Lord. Through determined cultivation of knowledge and detachment, a conditioned soul may try to purify himself without the mercy of Lord Kåñëa, but such false pride is to be given up, just as one must give up the false pride of material attraction. When pure devotional service to the Lord is available to a conditioned soul, attraction to other processes is certainly a deviation in his devotional career. Material desire stubbornly residing within the heart can be vanquished by taking full shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Without false confidence in one's own cultivation of knowledge and renunciation, one should depend fully on the mercy of Lord Kåñëa and at the same time strictly follow the rules and regulations of bhakti-yoga, as instructed by the Lord Himself.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa here reveals the transcendental glories of devotional service to the Lord. Although pure devotees are desireless, desiring only the Lord's service, sometimes a great devotee may desire the Lord's benediction to facilitate his loving service. In the Sixth Canto of the Bhägavatam we find that Çré Citraketu, a great devotee of the Lord, desired promotion to heaven so that accompanied by the most attractive ladies of the Vidyädhara planet he could beautifully chant the glories of the Lord. Similarly, Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé, the great narrator of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, desiring to avoid entanglement in the illusory potency of the Lord, would not come out of his mother's womb. In other words, Çukadeva Gosvämé desired apavargam, or liberation from mäyä, so that his devotional service would not be disturbed. Lord Kåñëa personally sent the illusory energy far away so that Çukadeva Gosvämé would come out of his mother's womb. Because of intense loving desire to serve the lotus feet of the Lord, a devotee may also desire promotion to the spiritual world. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, a devotee, having given up the independent cultivation of knowledge and detachment, may have firm faith in the devotional service of the Lord and yet remain slightly attached to the fruits of such activities. By expert fruitive activities one gains residence in material heaven, and by cultivation of detachment one is relieved of all bodily distress. If Lord Kåñëa detects within a devotee's heart the desire for such benedictions, the Lord can easily award them to His devotee. The word itaraiù in this verse indicates visiting holy places, accepting religious vows and so forth. Several auspicious processes of elevation are mentioned in the verse preceding this, but all the auspicious results of these processes are easily achieved by loving service to the Lord. Thus all devotees of the Lord, in whatever stage of advancement, should dedicate their energy exclusively to the Lord's service, as affirmed in the Second Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam by Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé:</div>

<div class="First"> The words ekäntino mama indicate that the pure devotees of the Lord, being saintly and most intelligent, dedicate themselves exclusively to the devotional service of the Personality of Godhead. Even when the Lord offers them personal liberation from birth and death, the devotees will not accept it. A pure devotee automatically gains an eternal life of bliss and knowledge in the Lord's personal abode and thus considers mere liberation without the loving service of the Lord to be most abominable. One who chants Lord Kåñëa's holy name or superficially serves the Lord with the motive of achieving impersonal liberation or material sense gratification cannot be considered a transcendental devotee of the Lord. As long as one desires mundane religiosity, economic development, sense gratification or liberation, one cannot achieve the platform of samädhi, or perfect self-realization. Every living entity is actually the eternal servant of Lord Kåñëa and is constitutionally meant to engage in the loving service of the Lord without personal desire. This pure and supreme status of life is described in this verse by the Lord Himself.</div>

Çréla Prabhupäda remarks in this regard, "As the unmixed sun ray is very forceful and is therefore called tévra, similarly, unmixed bhakti-yoga of hearing, chanting, etc., may be performed by one and all regardless of inner motive." Undoubtedly, in this age of Kali people are generally very fallen and polluted by material lust, greed, anger, lamentation and so forth. In this age most people are sarva-käma, or full of material desires. Still we must understand that simply by taking shelter of Lord Kåñëa we will achieve everything in life. The living entity should not engage in any process except the loving service of the Lord. One must accept that Lord Kåñëa is the reservoir of all pleasure and that only Lord Kåñëa within our heart can fulfill our real desire. This simple faith that one will achieve everything by approaching Lord Kåñëa is the essence of all knowledge and carries even a fallen person over the painful hurdles of this difficult age.</div>

<div class="First"> The words buddheù param indicate that the material modes of nature cannot be found within a pure devotee absorbed in the transcendental qualities of the Lord. In the Second Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä, Lord Kåñëa clearly explains that a pure devotee is recognized by complete detachment from personal desire; therefore, a pure devotee constantly engaged in selfless service to Lord Kåñëa may not always observe the innumerable details of Vedic rituals and regulations. Such occasional negligence is not to be considered a transgression. Similarly, observance of ordinary material piety does not constitute the ultimate qualification of a soul surrendered to God. Love of Kåñëa and absolute surrender to the Lord's will raise one immediately to the transcendental platform, where activities performed on the Lord's behalf are absolute, being an expression of God's will. Ordinary materialistic persons sometimes falsely claim this exalted status for their whimsical, immoral activities and cause a great disturbance in society. However, just as an ordinary person should not falsely claim the executive privileges of the personal assistants of a national leader, similarly, an ordinary conditioned soul may not foolishly claim that his immoral, whimsical or speculative activities are sheltered by divine right, being the will of God. One must actually be a pure devotee of the Lord, empowered by the Lord Himself and completely surrendered to the will of the Lord, before one may be accepted as transcendental to ordinary piety and sin.</div>

Even an ordinary father or mother quickly excuses a momentary transgression by their child. Just as children and parents enjoy mutual love, the Lord's surrendered servants enjoy a loving relationship with the Lord. An unpremeditated, accidental falldown is quickly excused by the Lord, and all members of society must share in the Lord's own feelings, excusing such a sincere devotee. An advanced devotee should not be branded as materialistic or sinful because of accidental falldown. A devotee immediately returns to the platform of saintly service and begs the Lord's forgiveness. However, one who permanently remains in a fallen condition can no longer be accepted as a highly elevated devotee of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Chapnum"> 21. Lord Kåñëa's Explanation of the Vedic Path</div>
<div class="First"> There are persons who are unfit for all three of the forms of yoga-karma, jïäna and bhakti. They are inimical to Lord Kåñëa, attached to sense gratification, and are dominated by fruitive activities aimed at fulfillment of material desires. This chapter describes their faults in terms of place, time, substance and beneficiary of actions.</div>
<div class="First"> For those who are perfect in knowledge and devotion to the Lord, there are no materially good qualities or faults. But for a candidate endeavoring on the platform of karma to achieve cessation of material life, execution of regular and special fruitive duties is good and the failure to execute such is evil. That which counteracts sinful reaction is also good for him. For one on the platform of knowledge in the pure mode of goodness and for one on the platform of devotion, the proper actions are, respectively, cultivation of knowledge and practice of devotional service consisting of hearing, chanting and so forth. For both, everything detrimental to their proper actions is bad. But for persons who are not candidates for transcendental advancement or who are not perfected souls, namely those who are completely inimical to spiritual life and are devoted exclusively to fruitive work for fulfillment of lusty desires, there are numerous considerations of purity and impurity and auspiciousness and inauspiciousness. These are to be made in terms of one's body, the place of activity, the time, the objects utilized, the performer, the mantras chanted and the particular activity. In actuality, virtue and fault are not absolute but are relative to one's particular platform of advancement. Remaining fixed in the type of discrimination suitable to one's level of advancement is good, and anything else is bad. This is the basic understanding of virtue and fault. Even among objects belonging to the same category, there are different considerations of their purity or impurity in relation to performance of religious duties, worldly transactions, and the maintenance of one's life. These distinctions are described in various scriptures.</div>
<div class="First"> The doctrine of varëäçrama codifies precepts of bodily purity and impurity. With respect to place, purity and impurity are distinguished by such facts as the presence of black deer. In connection with time, there are distinctions of purity and impurity either in terms of the time itself or in terms of its specific relation with various objects. In connection with physical substances, distinctions of purity and impurity are made in terms of sanctification of objects and words and by such activities as bathing, giving charity, performing austere penances and remembering the Supreme Lord. There are also distinctions of the purity and impurity of the performers of actions. When one's knowledge of mantras is received from the lips of the bona fide spiritual master, one's mantra is considered pure, and one's work is purified by offering it unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If the six factors of place, time and so forth are purified, then there is dharma, or virtue, but otherwise there is adharma, or fault.</div>
<div class="First"> Ultimately, there is no substantial basis in distinctions of virtue and fault, because they transform according to place, time, beneficiary and so on. In regard to the execution of prescribed duties for sense gratification, the actual intent of all the scriptures is the subduing of materialistic propensities; such is the actual principle of religion that destroys sorrow, confusion and fear and bestows all good fortune. Work performed for sense gratification is not actually beneficial. The descriptions of such fruitive benefits offered in various phala-çrutis are actually meant to help one gradually cultivate a taste for the highest benefit. But persons of inferior intelligence take the flowery benedictory verses of the scriptures to be the actual purport of the Vedas; this opinion, however, is never held by those in factual knowledge of the truth of the Vedas. Persons whose minds are agitated by the flowery words of the Vedas have no attraction for hearing topics about Lord Hari. It should be understood that there is no inner purport to the Vedas apart from the original Personality of Godhead. The Vedas focus exclusively upon the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. Because this material world is simply the illusory energy of the Supreme Lord, it is by refuting material existence that one gains disassociation from matter.</div>

<div class="First"> As clearly explained by Lord Kåñëa in the previous chapters, philosophical analysis and also the performance of prescribed duties are ultimately meant for achieving Kåñëa consciousness, or pure love of God. Devotional service, based on hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord, directly engages the conditioned soul in the Lord's loving service and thus is the most efficient means of achieving the Lord. All three processes, however, share a common goal, Kåñëa consciousness. Now the Lord describes those who, being completely absorbed in material sense gratification, do not adopt any authorized means to achieve the Lord's mercy. Currently, hundreds of millions of unfortunate human beings fit squarely into this category and, as described here, perpetually suffer the bondage of material existence.</div>

<div class="First"> In the previous verse Lord Kåñëa explained that the path of spiritual progress begins with working without fruitive desires, advances to the stage of realized spiritual knowledge, and culminates in direct engagement in the devotional service of the Lord. Here the Lord emphasizes that a conditioned soul should not artificially disrupt the natural evolution of his Kåñëa consciousness by deviating from those duties prescribed by the Lord Himself. In the lower stages of human life one is entangled in false identification with the gross material body and desires to execute material fruitive activities based on society, friendship and love. When such materialistic activities are offered in sacrifice to the Supreme Lord, one becomes situated in karma-yoga. By regulated sacrifice one gradually gives up the gross bodily concept of life and advances to the stage of realization of spiritual knowledge, whereby one understands oneself to be an eternal spirit soul completely different from the material body and mind. Feeling relief from the pangs of materialism one becomes very attached to one's spiritual knowledge, and thus one is situated in the stage of jïäna-yoga. As the candidate further advances on the spiritual path, he understands himself to be part and parcel of the Supreme Soul, the Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa. He then sees that his conditional life as well as his spiritual knowledge was obtained from the Personality of Godhead, who awards the results of all types of activities, both pious and sinful. By directly engaging in the loving service of the Supreme Lord and understanding oneself to be the Lord's eternal servant, one's attachment evolves into pure love of Godhead. Thus one first gives up the lower stage of attachment to the material body and then subsequently gives up attachment to cultivation of spiritual knowledge. This relieves one of material life. Finally one recognizes the Lord Himself as the resting place of one's eternal love and fully surrenders to God in full Kåñëa consciousness.</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa explains in this verse that one who is still attached to the material body and mind cannot artificially give up the prescribed duties of karma-yoga. In the same way, one who is a spiritual neophyte, just beginning to realize the illusion of material life, should not artificially try to think of the Lord's intimate pastimes twenty-four hours a day, imitating the stage of prema-bhakti. Rather, he should cultivate analytic knowledge of the material world, by which one gives up attachment to the material body and mind. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam we find many analytic descriptions of the material world, and they can free the conditioned soul from false identification with matter. One who has achieved the perfect stage of love of Godhead, however, being freed from all gross and subtle attachments to the material world, may give up the lower stages of karma-yoga and jïäna-yoga and engage directly in the Lord's loving service.</div>
<div class="First"> In Chapter Nineteen, verse 45, Lord Kåñëa states, guëa-doña-dåçir doño guëas tübhaya-varjitaù. One should not see material good and evil within a devotee of the Lord. Indeed, one becomes pious by giving up such mundane conceptions. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura points out that occasionally a neophyte devotee may be polluted by association with those enthusiastically executing fruitive activities and mental speculation. Such a devotee's religious activities may be affected by mundane tendencies. Similarly, an ordinary person who observes the exalted status of a pure devotee sometimes externally imitates the devotee's activities, considering himself to be on the same exalted platform of pure devotional service. These imperfect practitioners of bhakti-yoga are not exempt from criticism, since their fruitive activities, mental speculation and false prestige are material intrusions in the pure loving service of the Lord. A pure devotee engaged exclusively in the Lord's service should not be criticized, but a devotee whose devotional service is mixed with material qualities may be corrected so that he can rise to the platform of pure devotional service. Innocent persons should not be misled by the mixed devotional service of those not engaged exclusively in the bhakti-yoga system, but those unable to fully engage in Kåñëa consciousness should nevertheless not give up their regular prescribed duties, declaring them to be illusion. For example, one unable to fully engage in pure Kåñëa consciousness should not give up his family, considering it an illusion, for by doing so he will fall into illicit sex life. Material piety and analytic knowledge of the material world must therefore be cultivated until one comes to the stage of directly practicing Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="Translation"> O sinless Uddhava, in order to understand what is proper in life one must evaluate a given object within its particular category. Thus, in analyzing religious principles one must consider purity and impurity. Similarly, in one's ordinary dealings one must distinguish between good and bad, and to insure one's physical survival one must recognize that which is auspicious and inauspicious.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In religious activities, ordinary dealings and personal survival one cannot avoid value judgements. Morality and religion are perennial necessities in civilized society; therefore distinctions between purity and impurity, piety and impiety, morality and immorality must somehow be ascertained. Similarly, in our ordinary, worldly activities we distinguish between palatable and tasteless food, good and bad business, high-class and low-class residences, good and bad friends, and so forth. And to insure our physical health and survival, we must constantly distinguish between what is safe and unsafe, healthy and unhealthy, profitable and unprofitable. Even a learned person must constantly distinguish between good and bad within the material world, but at the same time he must understand the transcendental position of Kåñëa consciousness. Despite one's careful calculation of that which is materially healthy and unhealthy, the physical body will collapse and die. Despite careful scrutiny of the socially favorable and unfavorable, one's entire social milieu will vanish with the passing of time. In the same way, great religions arise and disappear in the course of history. Thus mere religiosity, social and financial expertise or physical fitness cannot award the actual perfection of life. There is a transcendental good beyond the relative good of the material world. Any sane person accepts the practical and immediate necessity of material discrimination; yet one must come ultimately to the transcendental stage of Kåñëa consciousness, where life is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge. Lord Kåñëa, in His elaborate teachings to Çré Uddhava, is gradually clarifying the transcendental position of Kåñëa consciousness beyond the endless variety of material good and evil.</div>

<div class="Translation"> I have revealed this way of life for those bearing the burden of mundane religious principles.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Ordinary religious principles, prescribing innumerable rules, regulations and prohibitions, are undoubtedly a great burden for those bereft of Kåñëa consciousness. In the First Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.1.11) it is stated, bhüréëi bhüri-karmäëi çrotavyäni vibhägaçaù: there are countless religious scriptures in the world prescribing countless religious duties. The authorized scriptures are those spoken by the Lord Himself or His representatives, as stated in this verse. In the last chapter of Bhagavad-gétä (18.66) Lord Kåñëa states, sarva-dharmän parityajya mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja: [Bg. 18.66] one should give up the troublesome burden of mundane piety and directly take to the loving service of the Lord, in which everything is simplified. Lord Kåñëa also states in Bhagavad-gétä (9.2), su-sukham kartum avyayam: the bhakti-yoga process, which depends completely upon the mercy of the Lord, is very joyful and easily performed. Similarly, Locana däsa Öhäkura sings,</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">kevala änanda-käëòa</div>
<div class="First"> Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, who is Lord Kåñëa Himself, appeared five hundred years ago to distribute the sublime method of chanting the holy names of the Lord. In this way, rather than bearing the burden of artificial austerity, one can directly take to the Lord's service, cleansing one's heart and immediately experiencing transcendental bliss. Those who have taken to Caitanya Mahäprabhu's movement follow four basic principles: no illicit sex, no eating of meat, fish or eggs, no intoxication and no gambling. They rise early in the morning, chant Hare Kåñëa and spend the day happily engaged in the Lord's service. Those who follow the ritualistic karma-käëòa section of the Vedas, however, are burdened with innumerable regulations, rituals and ceremonies, which must be personally performed by the worshipers or performed on their behalf by qualified brähmaëas. At any moment there is danger of discrepancy resulting in the total loss of their accumulated piety. Similarly, those on the philosophical path must painstakingly define, refine and adjust philosophical categories, a process that generally ends in confusion and hopelessness. The practitioners of mystic yoga undergo grueling penances, subjecting themselves to severe heat and cold, near starvation and so on. All such materialistic persons have personal desires to fulfill, whereas the devotees of the Lord, who desire the Lord's pleasure, simply depend upon the Lord's mercy and go back home, back to Godhead. In the previous verse the Lord mentioned that in the material world there are endless distinctions and value judgements to be made in the course of one's life. A devotee, however, sees Kåñëa within everything and everything within Kåñëa, remaining humble, simple and blissful in the Lord's service. He does not perform elaborate religious ceremonies, nor does he become antisocial or immoral. The devotee simply chants the holy name of Kåñëa and easily achieves the highest perfection of life. Ordinary persons endeavor for bodily maintenance, but a devotee is automatically maintained by the Lord's mercy. A devotee's ordinary dealings and religious activities are also all dedicated to the Personality of Godhead; thus there is nothing but Kåñëa in a devotee's life. Kåñëa gives all protection and maintenance, and the devotee gives everything to Kåñëa. This natural liberated situation is called Kåñëa consciousness. It is the ultimate absolute good, as explained by the Lord throughout this canto.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Earth, water, fire, air and ether are the five basic elements that constitute the bodies of all conditioned souls, from Lord Brahmä himself down to the nonmoving creatures. These elements all emanate from the one Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> All material bodies are composed of different proportions of the same five gross elements, which emanate from the one Personality of Godhead and cover the living entities, who are all in the jéva category. The concepts of good and bad depend on the choice of the Supreme Lord and not on inherent qualitative differences in material objects. A Kåñëa conscious person ultimately sees all material phenomena as one. The devotee's good behavior, intelligent discrimination and artistic sense within the material world are all based on the will of God. The material elements, being emanations from the Supreme Lord, are ultimately all nondifferent. However, advocates of mundane piety fear that if the material duality of good and bad is minimized, people will become immoral or anarchistic. Certainly the impersonal and atheistic philosophy preached by modern scientists, in which material variety is reduced to mere mathematical descriptions of molecular and atomic particles, leads to immoral society. Although both material science and Vedic knowledge uncover the illusion of material variety and reveal the ultimate oneness of all material energy, only the devotees of Lord Kåñëa are surrendered to the supreme absolute piety of God's will. Thus they always act for the benefit of all living entities, accepting material variety in the Lord's service, according to the Lord's desire. Without Kåñëa consciousness, or God consciousness, people cannot understand the absolute position of spiritual goodness; instead they artificially try to construct a civilization based on interdependent self-interest on the material platform. Such a foolish arrangement easily collapses, as evidenced by widespread social conflict and chaos in the modern age. All members of a civilized society must accept the absolute authority of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and then social peace and harmony will not rest on the flimsy relative platform of mundane piety and sin.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear Uddhava, although all material bodies are composed of the same five elements and are thus equal, the Vedic literatures conceive of different names and forms in relation to such bodies so that the living entities may achieve their goal of life.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The words näma-rüpäëi viñamäëi refer to the system of varëäçrama-dharma, in which members of human society are designated according to four social and four occupational divisions. Those dedicated to intellectual or religious perfection are called brähmaëas, those dedicated to political perfection are called kñatriyas, those dedicated to financial perfection are called vaiçyas, and those dedicated to eating, sleeping, sex and honest work are called çüdras. Such propensities arise from the three modes of material nature (goodness, passion and ignorance), because the pure soul is not materially intellectual, ambitious for power, enterprising or servile. Rather, the pure soul is always absorbed in loving devotion to the Supreme Lord. If the various propensities of a conditioned soul are not engaged in the varëäçrama system, they will certainly be misused, and thus that person will fall down from the standard of human life. The Vedic system is designed by the Lord so that conditioned souls may pursue their individual achievements and at the same time advance toward the ultimate goal of life, Kåñëa consciousness. Just as a doctor deals with a crazy man by speaking to him sympathetically in terms of his false conception of life, one who understands the Vedic literature engages the living entities according to their illusory identification with the elements of matter. Although all material bodies are composed of the same material elements and are thus qualitatively identical, as described here by the word sameñu, the Vedic social system, varëäçrama, is created to engage all human beings in Kåñëa consciousness according to their various degrees of material identification. The absolute good is the Supreme Lord Himself, and that which approaches the Supreme Lord becomes similarly good. Because the sun is the source of heat within this world, an object that approaches the sun becomes hotter and hotter until it merges into fire. In the same manner, as we approach the transcendental nature of the Personality of Godhead, we automatically become surcharged with absolute goodness. Although this knowledge is the real basis of the Vedic literature, mundane piety is enjoined and sin is prohibited so that one can gradually come to the platform of material goodness, whereupon spiritual knowledge becomes visible.</div>

<div class="Translation"> O saintly Uddhava, in order to restrict materialistic activities, I have established that which is proper and improper among all material things, including time, space and all physical objects.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word niyamärtham ("in order to restrict") is significant in this verse. A conditioned soul falsely identifies with his material senses and thus considers anything giving immediate satisfaction to the body to be good and anything inconvenient or disturbing to be bad. By higher intelligence, however, one recognizes long-term self-interest and danger. For example, medicine may be immediately bitter, but by calculating one's long-term interest one accepts the bitter medicine to cure a disease that is not immediately troublesome but ultimately fatal. Similarly, Vedic literature restricts the sinful propensities of human beings by establishing what is proper and what is improper among all the objects and activities of the material world. Because everyone must eat, the Vedas prescribe foods in the mode of goodness and not those which are sinful, such as meat, fish and eggs. Similarly, one is advised to live in a peaceful and pious community and not in association with sinful persons, nor in an unclean or turbulent environment. By designating and restricting the exploitation of the material world, Vedic knowledge gradually brings a conditioned soul to the platform of material goodness. At that stage one becomes eligible to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead and enter the transcendental stage of life. It should be remembered that such mere eligibility does not constitute actual qualification; without Kåñëa consciousness mere mundane piety can never qualify a conditioned soul to go back home, back to Godhead. Within this world we are all infected by false pride, which must be diminished through submission to the Vedic injunctions. One who is completely engaged in the loving service of the Lord need not adopt these preliminary methods, for he directly contacts the Personality of Godhead through the spontaneous process of surrender. In the previous verse the Lord explained why Vedic literatures assign different values to the bodies of different living entities, and here the Lord explains the Vedic value system in regard to the material objects that interact with these bodies.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Among places, those bereft of the spotted antelope, those devoid of devotion to the brähmaëas, those possessing spotted antelopes but bereft of respectable men, provinces like Kékaöa and places where cleanliness and purificatory rites are neglected, where meat-eaters are prominent or where the earth is barren, are all considered to be contaminated lands.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word kåñëa-sära refers to the spotted antelope, whose hide is used by brahmacärés while residing in the äçrama of the spiritual master. Brahmacärés never hunt in the forest, but rather accept skins from those animals already deceased. The skin of the black or spotted antelope is also used as a garment by those receiving instruction in the execution of Vedic sacrifice. Therefore, since sacrifice cannot be properly performed in areas bereft of such creatures, these places are impure. Furthermore, although the inhabitants of a particular place may be expert in performing fruitive activities and ritualistic sacrifices, if they are inimical to the devotional service of the Lord, such a place is also polluted. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura explains that previously the provinces of Bihar and Bengal were bereft of devotional service to the Lord and were considered impure. Then great Vaiñëavas such as Jayadeva appeared in these territories, converting them into holy places. The word asauvéra indicates those places without suvéras, respectable saintly persons. Ordinarily, a person who obeys the state laws is considered a respectable citizen. In the same way, one who strictly obeys the law of God is considered to be a cultured or decent man, suvéra. The place where such intelligent persons reside is called sauvéram. Kékaöa refers to the modern state of Bihar, which traditionally has been known as a territory of uncivilized men. Even in such provinces, however, any place where saintly persons gather is considered to be holy. On the other hand, a province of generally respectable persons is immediately polluted by the presence of sinful men. Asaàskåta indicates lack of external cleanliness, as well as the absence of purificatory ceremonies for internal cleanliness. Çréla Madhväcärya quotes from the Skanda Puräëa as follows: "Religious persons should reside within an eight-mile radius of rivers, oceans, mountains, hermitages, forests, spiritual cities or places where the çälagräma-çélä is found. All other places should be considered kékaöa, or contaminated. But if even in such contaminated places black and spotted antelopes are found, one may reside there as long as sinful persons are not also present. Even if sinful persons are present, if the civil power rests with respectable authorities, one may remain. Similarly, one may dwell wherever the Deity of Viñëu is duly installed and worshiped." The Lord here elaborates upon the theme of piety and sin, which are based on purity and impurity. Thus pure and contaminated places of residence are described here.</div>

<div class="First"> Having discussed pure and impure places, the Lord now discusses different qualities of time. Certain times, such as the brähma-muhürta, the last few hours before sunrise, are always auspicious for spiritual advancement. Other times, not auspicious in themselves, become so by achievement of material prosperity that facilitates one's mission in life.</div>
<div class="First"> Political, social or economic disturbances that obstruct the execution of one's religious duties are considered inauspicious times. Similarly, a woman is considered contaminated just after childbirth or during her menstrual period. She cannot perform ordinary religious activities at such times, which are therefore inauspicious and impure. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura explains that the most auspicious of all times is the moment one achieves the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one neglects the loving service of the Lord, being carried away by sense gratification, he is certainly living in most inauspicious times. Therefore that moment in which one achieves the association of the Supreme Lord or the Lord's pure devotee is the most auspicious time, whereas the moment of losing such association is most inauspicious. In other words, the perfection of life is simply Kåñëa consciousness, by which one transcends the dualities of time and space caused by the three modes of material nature.</div>

<div class="First"> Cloth is purified by application of clean water and contaminated by application of urine. The words of a saintly brähmaëa are pure, but the sound vibration of a materialistic person is contaminated by lust and envy. A saintly devotee explains actual purity to others, whereas a nondevotee makes false propaganda that leads innocent people to commit polluted, sinful activities. Pure rituals are those meant for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, while materialistic ceremonies are those that lead their followers into materialistic and demoniac activities. The word saàskäreëa also indicates that the purity or impurity of a particular object is ascertained according to the regulations of ritualistic performances. For example, a flower to be offered to the Deity must be purified with water. Flowers or food cannot be offered to the Deity, however, if they have been contaminated by being smelled or tasted before the offering. The word kälena indicates that certain substances are purified by time and others contaminated by time. Rainwater, for example, is considered pure after ten days' time, and after three days in cases of emergency. On the other hand, certain foods decay in time and thus become impure. Mahatva indicates that great bodies of water do not become contaminated, and alpatayä means that a small amount of water can easily become polluted or stagnant. In the same way, a great soul is not polluted by occasional contact with materialistic persons, whereas one whose devotion to God is very small is easily carried away and put into doubt by bad association. In terms of combination with other substances, and in terms of speech, ritual, time and magnitude, the purity and impurity of all objects can be ascertained. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura remarks that impure or decayed food is certainly forbidden for normal persons but is permissible for those who have no other means of subsistence.</div>

<div class="First"> The Lord has described the purity and impurity of different places, times and material objects. According to the laws of nature, that which is impure contaminates a particular person in accordance with that person's situation, as described here. For example, on certain occasions, such as a solar eclipse or just after childbirth, one must restrict the intake of food according to ritualistic injunctions. One who is physically weak, however, may eat without being considered impious. Ordinary persons consider the ten days following childbirth to be most auspicious, whereas one who is learned knows that this period is actually impure. Ignorance of the law does not save one from being punished, but one who consciously commits sinful activities is considered most fallen. Concerning opulence (samåddhi), worn-out, dirty clothing or a messy residence are considered impure for a rich man but acceptable for one who is poor. The word deça indicates that in a safe and peaceful place one is obligated to strictly perform religious rituals, whereas in a dangerous or chaotic situation one may be excused for occasional negligence of secondary principles. One who is physically healthy must offer obeisances to the Deities, attend religious functions and execute his prescribed duties, but a young child or sickly person may be excused from such activities, as indicated by the word avasthä.</div>

One must learn the process of serving God from the bona fide spiritual master and thus always maintain one's existence pure and free from anxiety.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word avasthä indicates that when boys and girls are young they are kept pure by youthful innocence and that as they grow up they are kept pure through proper education and engagement. By one's individual potency one should avoid sinful activities and the association of those inclined toward sense gratification. The word karma here refers to prescribed duties, such as worshiping the spiritual master and the Deity, chanting the Gäyatré mantra three times daily and accepting spiritual initiation. The prescribed duties of the varëäçrama system automatically purify one from the covering of false ego by dovetailing one's bodily designation in appropriate religious activities. There are specific duties for brähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas, çüdras, brahmacärés, gåhasthas, vänaprasthas and sannyäsés, as described previously in this canto by the Lord Himself. The most significant word here is mat-småtyä ("by remembrance of Me"). Ultimately, one cannot avoid the infection of illusion through any process except Kåñëa consciousness. The three modes of nature perpetually interact, and one must sometimes fall into the mode of ignorance and sometimes rise to the mode of goodness, uselessly rotating within the kingdom of illusion. But by Kåñëa consciousness, remembrance of the Personality of Godhead, one can actually uproot one's tendency to act against the will of the Absolute Truth. Then one becomes freed from the clutches of mäyä and goes back home, back to Godhead. As stated in the Garuòa Puräëa,</div>

<div class="Translation"> Sometimes piety becomes sin, and sometimes what is ordinarily sin becomes piety on the strength of Vedic injunctions. Such special rules in effect eradicate the clear distinction between piety and sin.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The Lord clearly explains here that material piety and sin are always relative considerations. For example, if a neighbor's house is on fire and one chops a hole in the roof so that the trapped family may escape, one is considered to be a pious hero because of the dangerous condition. In normal conditions, however, if one chops a hole in his neighbor's roof or breaks the neighbor's windows, he is considered a criminal. Similarly, one who abandons one's wife and children is certainly irresponsible and thoughtless. If one takes sannyäsa, however, and remains fixed on a higher spiritual platform, he is considered to be a most saintly person. Piety and sin therefore depend upon particular circumstances and are at times difficult to distinguish. According to Çréla Madhväcärya, persons above the age of fourteen are considered capable of distinguishing between good and bad and are thus responsible for their pious and sinful activities. Animals, on the other hand, being merged in ignorance, cannot be blamed for their offenses or praised for their so-called good qualities, which all arise ultimately from ignorance. Human beings who act like animals, with the idea that one should not feel any guilt but should do whatever one likes, will certainly take birth as animals absorbed in ignorance. And there are other foolish people who, observing the relativity of material piety and sin, conclude that there is no absolute good. It should be understood, however, that Kåñëa consciousness is absolutely good because it involves complete obedience to the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose goodness is eternal and absolute. Those who are inclined to study material piety and sin ultimately experience frustration due to the relativity and variability of the subject matter. One should therefore come to the transcendental platform of Kåñëa consciousness, which is valid and perfect in all circumstances.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> The same activities that would degrade an elevated person do not cause falldown for those who are already fallen. Indeed, one who is lying on the ground cannot possibly fall further. The material association that is dictated by one's own nature is considered a good quality.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The Lord here further describes the ambiguity in ascertaining material piety and sin. Although intimate association with women is most abominable for a renounced sannyäsé, the same association is pious for a householder, who is ordered by Vedic injunction to approach his wife at the suitable time for procreation. Similarly, a brähmaëa who drinks liquor is considered to be committing a most abominable act, whereas a çüdra, a low-class man, who can moderate his drinking is considered to be self-controlled. Piety and sin on the material level are thus relative considerations. Any member of society, however, who receives dékñä, initiation into the chanting of the Lord's holy names, must strictly obey the four regulative principles: no eating of meat, fish or eggs, no illicit sex, no intoxication and no gambling. A spiritually initiated person neglecting these principles will certainly fall from his elevated position of liberation.</div>

<div class="First"> "Renunciation is the basic principle sustaining the lives of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu's devotees. Seeing this renunciation, Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is extremely satisfied." Because of false ego one considers oneself to be the proprietor and enjoyer of one's activities. Actually, Lord Kåñëa, the Personality of Godhead, is the proprietor and enjoyer of our activities; recognition of this fact in Kåñëa consciousness leads one to real renunciation. Every human being should perform his prescribed duty as an offering to the Supreme Lord. Then there will be no possibility of material entanglement. Lord Kåñëa clearly explains in Bhagavad-gétä that prescribed duties performed as an offering to the Lord award liberation from material bondage. Sinful activities cannot be offered to the Lord but must be given up altogether. In effect, the distinction between piety and sin is made so that the living entities will become pious and eligible to surrender to the Supreme Lord. As explained in Bhagavad-gétä (7.28),</div>

<div class="Translation"> One who accepts material sense objects as desirable certainly becomes attached to them. From such attachment lust arises, and this lust creates quarrel among men.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The actual goal of human life should not be material sense gratification, for it is the basis of conflict in human society. Although the Vedic literature sometimes sanctions sense gratification, the ultimate purpose of the Vedas is renunciation, since Vedic culture cannot possibly recommend anything that disturbs human life. A lusty person is easily angered and becomes inimical to anyone frustrating his lusty desires. Since his sex desire can never be satisfied, a lusty person ultimately becomes frustrated with his own sex partner, and thus a "love-hate" relationship develops. A lusty person considers himself to be the enjoyer of God's creation and is therefore full of pride and false prestige. The lusty, proud person will not be attracted to the process of humble submission at the lotus feet of the bona fide spiritual master. Attraction to illicit sex is thus the direct enemy of Kåñëa consciousness, which depends upon humble submission to the representative of the Supreme Lord. Lord Kåñëa also states in Bhagavad-gétä that desire for illicit sex is the all-devouring, sinful enemy of this world.</div>
<div class="First"> Because modern society sanctions unrestricted mixing of men and women, its citizens cannot possibly achieve peace; rather, the regulation of conflict becomes the basis of social survival. This is the symptom of an ignorant society falsely accepting the material body as the highest good, as described here by the words viñayeñu guëädhyäsät. One who is too affectionate to his own body will inevitably be seized by sex desire.</div>

Since every living entity is part and parcel of Kåñëa, anyone who falsely identifies with the external body is actually unconscious of his real position. Thus it is stated, çünyäya kalpate: pursuing that which has no factual existence, he is devoid of any tangible progress or benefit in life. One whose consciousness is absorbed in the nonexistent becomes himself practically nonexistent. In this way, the eternal living entities become fallen, lost in the ocean of material existence, and it is only by the special mercy of the pure devotees of the Lord that they can be rescued. The Lord's devotees therefore instruct the fallen people to chant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. By this process our real consciousness and life can be quickly revived.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In the previous verse Lord Kåñëa stated that persons absorbed in sense gratification certainly deviate from the real purpose of human life. But since the Vedas themselves promise heavenly sense gratification as the result of sacrifice and austerity, how can such promotion to heaven be considered a deviation from the goal of life? The Lord here explains that the fruitive rewards offered in religious scriptures are merely inducements, like candy that is used to induce a child to take medicine. It is actually the medicine that is beneficial, and not the candy. Similarly, in fruitive sacrifices it is the worship of Lord Viñëu that is beneficial, not the fruitive reward itself. According to Bhagavad-gétä, those professing fruitive rewards to be the ultimate goal of religious scripture are certainly less intelligent fools inimical to the purpose of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord desires that all conditioned souls be purified and come back home, back to Godhead, for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge. One who opposes the Lord's purpose in the name of religiosity is certainly bewildered about the purpose of life.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Materialistic persons are not prepared to renounce society, friendship and love, which are all based on sex indulgence, to instead take to a life of renunciation and self-realization. In order to bring such foolish persons under the canopy of Vedic injunctions, the Vedas promise innumerable material rewards, even promotion to heavenly planets, to those who faithfully execute the Vedic injunctions. As explained by the Lord, such rewards are like the candy offered to a child, who then faithfully takes his medicine. Material enjoyment is certainly the cause of suffering, since all enjoyable objects are subject to destruction along with the so-called enjoyer. Material life is simply painful and full of anxiety, frustration and lamentation. We become agitated by seeing a so-called enjoyable object, such as the naked body of a woman, a beautiful residence, a sumptuous tray of food or the expansion of our own prestige, but actually such imagined happiness is simply the intense expectation of a satisfaction that never comes. One remains perpetually frustrated in material existence, and the more one tries to enjoy, the more one's frustration increases. Therefore, the Vedic knowledge, which aims at ultimate peace and happiness on the spiritual platform, cannot possibly authorize the materialistic way of life. Material rewards are employed by the Vedas merely as inducements for the conditioned soul to take the medicine, submission to the Supreme Lord, Viñëu, through various types of sacrifice. Those who are veda-väda-rata claim that religious scriptures are meant to facilitate sense gratification in the ignorance of conditioned life. The true goal of religion, however, is spiritual liberation, in which material sense gratification ceases to exist. The darkness of bodily attachment cannot exist in the effulgent light of spiritual knowledge. In the ocean of spiritual bliss, the anxiety-ridden apparent pleasure of this world vanishes completely. The true meaning of veda, or perfect knowledge, is to surrender to the Supreme Lord in full Kåñëa consciousness for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge as the Lord's faithful servant.</div>

<div class="First"> The followers of the karma-mémäàsä philosophy declare that there is no eternal kingdom of God beyond this universe and that one should therefore become a professional performer of Vedic rituals in order to keep oneself in a material heavenly planet. As explained by the Lord to Çré Uddhava in a previous chapter, there is no actual happiness in the material world, since one will inevitably rotate throughout the various planetary environments stretching from heaven to hell and thus always be disturbed within the material atmosphere. Although the doctor may give a child candy-covered medicine, one who urges the child to eat the candy and throw away the medicine is certainly a great fool. In the same way, the flowery statements of the Vedas describing heavenly enjoyment do not award the real fruit of Vedic knowledge but merely supply decorative blossoms of sense gratification. As stated in the Vedas (Åg Veda 1.22.20), tad viñëoù paramaà padaà sadä paçyanti sürayaù. Even the demigods, who are permanent residents of heaven, are always looking to the eternal abode of the Supreme Lord. Foolish people who admire the standard of living in material heaven should therefore note that the demigods themselves are devotees of the Supreme Lord. One should not become a bogus propagator of so-called Vedic knowledge but should take to Kåñëa consciousness and make a genuine solution to the problem of progressing in life.</div>

<div class="First"> Those attached to female association become proud separatists; desiring everything for their personal gratification and that of their lady friends, they become greedy misers, full of anxiety and envy. Such unfortunate persons mistake the flowery statements of the Vedas to be the highest perfection of life. The word agni-mugdhäù, "bewildered by fire," indicates that such persons consider Vedic fire sacrifices awarding material benefit to be the highest religious truth, and thus they merge into ignorance. Fire produces smoke, which obscures one's vision. Similarly, the path of fruitive fire sacrifices is cloudy and obscure, without clear understanding of the spirit soul. The Lord here clearly states that fruitive religionists cannot understand their actual spiritual identity, nor do they realize the genuine shelter of the spirit soul in the kingdom of God.</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa states in Bhagavad-gétä (15.15), vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù: all Vedic knowledge is actually meant to lead one to pure love of Godhead.

<div class="First"> The word uktha-çasträù refers to the chanting of certain Vedic hymns, by which one obtains fruitive results in this world and the next. The word çastra also indicates a weapon, and thus uktha-çastra also means the weapon used in Vedic sacrifice to kill the sacrificial animal. Persons exploiting Vedic knowledge for bodily gratification are slaughtering themselves with the weapon of materialistic religious principles. They are also compared to those trying to see within a dense fog. The false bodily concept of life, in which one ignores the eternal soul within the body, is a dense fog of ignorance that blocks our vision of God. Lord Kåñëa therefore begins His instruction in Bhagavad-gétä by clearing away the dense ignorance of the bodily concept of life. Religion means the law of God. The Lord's final order, or law, is that every conditioned soul surrender unto Him, learn to serve and love Him, and thus go back home, back to Godhead. This is the process of Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Those who are sworn to sense gratification cannot understand the confidential conclusion of Vedic knowledge as explained by Me. Taking pleasure in violence, they cruelly slaughter innocent animals in sacrifice for their own sense gratification and thus worship demigods, forefathers and leaders among ghostly creatures. Such passion for violence, however, is never encouraged within the process of Vedic sacrifice.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The Vedic scriptures sanction occasional animal sacrifice to satisfy cruel, low-class men who cannot live without the taste of flesh and blood. Such concessions, however, are restricted by rigorous obligatory rituals and are meant to gradually discourage animal-killing, just as the exorbitant cost of a liquor license restricts the number of retail outlets selling alcoholic beverages. But unscrupulous persons misconstrue such restrictive sanctions and declare that Vedic sacrifice is meant for killing animals in order to enjoy sense gratification. Being materialistic, they desire to attain the planets of the forefathers or demigods and thus worship such beings. Sometimes materialistic persons are attracted to the subtle life-style of ghosts and worship ghostly creatures. These methods constitute gross ignorance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the actual enjoyer of all sacrifice and austerity. The demons perform Vedic sacrifice but are inimical to Lord Näräyaëa, for they consider the demigods, the forefathers or Lord Çiva to be equal to God. Although understanding the authority of Vedic rituals, they do not accept the ultimate Vedic conclusion and therefore never surrender to God. Thus false religious principles flourish in the demoniac societies of the animal-killers. Although in countries like America people outwardly profess to be followers of God alone, actual worship and glorification is offered to innumerable popular heroes such as entertainers, politicians, athletes and other equally insignificant persons. Animal-killers, being grossly materialistic, are inevitably attracted to the extraordinary features of material illusion; they cannot understand the real platform of Kåñëa consciousness, or spiritual life.</div>

<div class="First"> Although the demigods are part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, demigod worship fosters the false idea that the demigods exist apart from the Supreme Lord. Such worship is avidhi-pürvakam, or an improper approach to the Absolute Truth. Çréla Madhväcärya quotes from the Hari-vaàça that among those primarily in the mode of ignorance there are sometimes manifestations of passion and goodness. Ignorant persons possessing a tendency toward goodness may go to hell but are also allowed a little heavenly pleasure. Thus it can be seen that a man suffering in miserable financial or political conditions sometimes enjoys the company of a beautiful wife, though his general condition is hellish. Those in ignorance mixed slightly with passion simply go to hell, and those purely in the mode of ignorance glide down to the darkest region of hell. Those devoid of devotion to the Supreme Lord are in ignorance in these three categories. Sometimes persons situated in the mode of goodness accept the supremacy of the Supreme Lord but are more attracted to the demigods, believing that through Vedic rituals they can achieve the same standard of living as the demigods. This proud tendency is certainly an obstacle in the loving service of the Supreme Lord and ultimately causes falldown.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In the previous verses Lord Kåñëa clearly refuted the concept that Vedic knowledge is meant for material enjoyment, and here the Lord summarizes the actual purpose of Vedic literature: self-realization. Although the conditioned souls are struggling in the network of material energy, their actual existence is transcendental freedom in the kingdom of God. The Vedas gradually lift the conditioned soul out of the darkness of illusion and establish him in the eternal loving service of the Lord. As stated in the Vedänta-sütra (4.4.23), anävåttiù çabdät: "One who properly hears Vedic knowledge does not have to return to the cycle of birth and death."</div>
<div class="First"> One may ask why the Lord Himself as well as the Lord's representatives, the Vedic seers and mantras, speak in esoteric or indirect terms. As the Lord states in Bhagavad-gétä, näham prakäçaù sarvasya: [Bg. 7.25] the Supreme Lord does not allow Himself to be taken cheaply, and thus He is not manifest to superficial or inimical people. Those who are polluted by the material atmosphere are induced to purify themselves through Vedic rituals that offer fruitive results, just as a child is induced to take medicine by the offer of a candy reward. Because of the confidential nature of Vedic exposition, less intelligent persons cannot appreciate the ultimate transcendental purpose of the Vedas, and consequently they fall down to the platform of sense gratification.</div>
<div class="First"> The term brahmätma ("spirit soul") ultimately indicates the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who states in Bhagavad-gétä that knowledge of Him is räja-guhyam, the most confidential of all secrets. One who depends upon material sense perception remains in gross ignorance of the Absolute Truth. One who depends upon mental and intellectual speculation may get a clue that the eternal soul and Supersoul are both within the material body. But one who depends upon the Lord Himself, faithfully hearing the Lord's own message in Bhagavad-gétä, perfectly understands the entire situation and goes back home, back to Godhead, having fulfilled the true purpose of Vedic knowledge.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The transcendental sound of the Vedas is very difficult to comprehend and manifests on different levels within the präëa, senses and mind. This Vedic sound is unlimited, very deep and unfathomable, just like the ocean.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Vedic knowledge, the Vedic sound is divided into four phases, which can be understood only by the most intelligent brähmaëas. This is because three of the divisions are internally situated within the living entity and only the fourth division is externally manifested, as speech. Even this fourth phase of Vedic sound, called vaikharé, is very difficult to understand for ordinary human beings. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains these divisions as follows. The präëa phase of Vedic sound, known as parä, is situated in the ädhära-cakra; the mental phase, known as paçyanté, is situated in the area of the navel, on the maëipüraka-cakra; the intellectual phase, known as madhyamä, is situated in the heart area, in the anähata-cakra. Finally, the manifest sensory phase of Vedic sound is called vaikharé. Such Vedic sound is ananta-pära because it comprehends all vital energies within the universe and beyond and is thus undivided by time or space. Actually, Vedic sound vibration is so subtle, unfathomable and deep that only the Lord Himself and His empowered followers such as Vyäsa and Närada can understand its actual form and meaning. Ordinary human beings cannot comprehend all of the intricacies and subtleties of Vedic sound, but if one takes to Kåñëa consciousness one can immediately understand the conclusion of all Vedic knowledge, namely Lord Kåñëa Himself, the original source of Vedic knowledge. Foolish persons devote their vital air, senses and mind to sense gratification and thus do not understand the transcendental value of the holy name of God. Ultimately, the essence of all Vedic sound is the holy name of the Supreme Lord, which is not different from the Lord Himself. Since the Lord is unlimited, His holy name is equally unlimited. No one can understand the transcendental glories of the Lord without the Lord's direct mercy. By offenselessly chanting the holy names Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, one can enter into the transcendental mysteries of Vedic sound. Otherwise the knowledge of the Vedas will remain durvigähyam, or impossible to penetrate.</div>

Thus the Lord, from the ethereal sky of His heart, creates the great and limitless Vedic sound by the agency of His mind, which conceives of variegated sounds such as the sparças. The Vedic sound branches out in thousands of directions, adorned with the different letters expanded from the syllable oà: the consonants, vowels, sibilants and semivowels. The Veda is then elaborated by many verbal varieties, expressed in different meters, each having four more syllables than the previous one. Ultimately the Lord again withdraws His manifestation of Vedic sound within Himself.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has given an elaborate technical explanation of these three verses, the understanding of which requires extensive linguistic knowledge of the Sanskrit language. The essential point is that transcendental knowledge is expressed through Vedic sound vibration, which is itself a manifestation of the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. Vedic sound emanates from the Supreme Lord and is vibrated to glorify and understand Him. The conclusion of all Vedic sound vibration is found in Bhagavad-gétä, wherein the Lord states, vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù: [Bg. 15.15] all Vedic knowledge is simply meant to teach us to know and love God. One who always thinks of Lord Kåñëa, who becomes the Lord's devotee and who bows down to and worships the Lord with faith and devotion, chanting His holy name, has certainly achieved a perfect understanding of all that is indicated by the word veda ("knowledge").</div>

So-called philosophers, either Vedic scholars or ordinary men, may give their sectarian opinion, but it is the Lord Himself who knows the confidential purpose of the Vedas.

All Vedic formulas are understood to be preliminary stages leading to the perfect stage of Kåñëa consciousness, in which one fully surrenders to the devotional service of the Lord. The pure devotees of the Lord represent Him within this world and never speak anything which is not authorized by the Lord. Because they are repeating the Lord's own words, they are also to be understood as true knowers of the Veda.</div>

<div class="Translation"> I am the ritualistic sacrifice enjoined by the Vedas, and I am the worshipable Deity. It is I who am presented as various philosophical hypotheses, and it is I alone who am then refuted by philosophical analysis. The transcendental sound vibration thus establishes Me as the essential meaning of all Vedic knowledge. The Vedas, elaborately analyzing all material duality as nothing but My illusory potency, ultimately completely negate this duality and achieve their own satisfaction.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The Lord declared in the previous verse that He alone knows the ultimate purpose of the Vedas, and now the Lord reveals that He alone is the ultimate basis and purpose of all Vedic knowledge. The karma-käëòa section of the Vedas prescribes ritualistic sacrifices for promotion to heaven. Such sacrifices are the Lord Himself. Similarly, the upäsanä-käëòa section of the Vedas designates different demigods as objects of ritualistic worship, and these deities are not different from the Lord Himself, being expansions of the Lord's body. In the jïäna-käëòa section of the Vedas different philosophical methods of analysis are presented and refuted. Such knowledge, which analyzes the potency of the Supreme Lord, is not different from Him. Ultimately Lord Kåñëa is everything, because everything is part and parcel of the Lord's multipotencies. Although Vedic literature entices those absorbed in material duality to begin the Vedic way of life by offering them materially desirable rewards, the Vedas eventually refute all material duality by bringing one to the stage of God consciousness, wherein there is nothing different from the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> Within the Vedic literature there are various injunctions stating that at a particular stage of life one should give up fruitive rituals and take to the path of knowledge. Similarly, other injunctions declare that a self-realized soul should give up the path of speculative knowledge and take directly to the shelter of the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. But nowhere is there an injunction recommending that one give up the loving service of the Lord, because that is the eternal constitutional position of every living entity. Different philosophical theses are presented and rejected in the Vedas, since one who is progressing must give up each previous stage in the advancement of knowledge. For example, one who is addicted to sex enjoyment is taught to accept religious marriage and enjoy sex pleasure with his wife. Such ritualistic knowledge is to be given up when one attains the stage of detachment, whereupon one is recommended to take the renounced order of life. In that stage of life one is forbidden to see or speak with women. When, however, one reaches the perfection of Kåñëa consciousness, wherein the Lord is manifest everywhere, one may engage all living entities, including women, in the loving service of the Lord without danger of spiritual falldown. Thus different injunctions based on progressive stages of spiritual vision are presented and refuted in Vedic literature. Since all such injunctions and processes are ultimately meant for the achievement of Kåñëa consciousness, the loving service of the Lord, they are not different from Lord Kåñëa Himself. The conditioned soul, therefore, should not prematurely stop his progressive march back home, back to Godhead, by foolishly mistaking an intermediate or preliminary stage of advancement as the actual goal of life. One must understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, is the source, maintenance and resting place of everything, and that every living entity is the Lord's eternal servant. In this way one should continue on the Vedic path all the way back home, back to Godhead, for eternal life of bliss and knowledge.</div>
<div class="First"> Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Twenty-first Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Lord Kåñëa's Explanation of the Vedic Path."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 22. Enumeration of the Elements of Material Creation</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter enumerates and categorizes the natural elements, explains the difference between the male and female natures and describes birth and death. There are many opinions concerning the number of material elements. But this difference of opinions, brought about by the influence of the illusory energy, is not illogical. All the elements of nature exist everywhere; so authorities who have accepted the illusory potency of the Supreme Personality may propose a variety of theories. The insurmountable illusory energy of God is the root cause of their mutually contradictory arguments. There is no difference between the ultimate enjoyer and the supreme controller. To presuppose any distinction between them is senseless. Ordinary knowledge is simply a quality of material nature, not of the soul proper. The raw substance of material nature is designated according to its different phases. In the mode of goodness, it is known as knowledge, in the mode of passion as activity, and in the mode of darkness as ignorance. Time is another name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and another name for material propensity is sütra or mahat-tattva. The twenty-five elements of nature are the Lord, nature, the mahat, false ego, ether, air, fire, water, earth, the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, the skin, speech, the hands, the feet, the genitals, the anus, the mind, sound, touch, form, taste and smell. The unmanifest Supreme Personality merely glances at nature. Material nature, which is under the control of the Supreme Lord, then assumes the forms of causes and effects and carries out the creation, maintenance and destruction of the material world. Even though the puruña and prakåti appear nondifferent to superficial vision, there is an ultimate difference between the two. Material creation is produced from the modes of prakåti, and its quality is transformation. The living entities who are inimical to the Supreme Personality of Godhead take on and give up various kinds of material bodies through the agency of their own material work. But those who are ignorant of the self, because of being bewildered by illusion, do not understand this. The mind, which is filled with ideas of fruitive work, simply takes the senses with it from one body to another, while the soul follows along. Nevertheless, on account of being totally absorbed in sense gratification, one cannot remember his past existence.</div>
<div class="First"> The body undergoes nine stages of manifestation, which are brought about by association with the qualities of material nature. These are impregnation, gestation, birth, childhood, youth, maturity, middle age, old age and death. From the death of one's father and the birth of one's son, a person can easily comprehend the rise and fall of his own body. The soul, who is the perceiver, is different from this body. But when there is no knowledge of the true facts, the living entity, confused by the objects of sense gratification, achieves his destinations within the cycle of material existence. Thus the living entity continuously wanders under the spell of material work, taking birth as a sage or a demigod when he is predominated by the mode of goodness, among the demons or human beings when he is predominantly influenced by the mode of passion, and in the species of ghosts, spirits or animals when he is predominated by the mode of ignorance. The spirit soul does not engage in the enjoyment of sense objects; rather, it is the senses that perform this activity. Therefore the living being has no actual need for sense gratificatory pleasures. With the exception of those peaceful personalities who have taken shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and are dedicated to the divine duty of His service, everyone, including so-called learned scholars, is inevitably overcome by the all-powerful material nature.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Uddhava inquired: My dear Lord, O master of the universe, how many different elements of creation have been enumerated by the great sages? I have heard You personally describe a total of twenty-eight—God, the jéva soul, the mahat-tattva, false ego, the five gross elements, the ten senses, the mind, the five subtle objects of perception and the three modes of nature. But some authorities say that there are twenty-six elements, while others cite twenty-five or else seven, nine, six, four or eleven, and even others say that there are seventeen, sixteen or thirteen. What did each of these sages have in mind when he calculated the creative elements in such different ways? O supreme eternal, kindly explain this to me.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa thoroughly explained in the previous chapter that Vedic knowledge is not meant for sense gratification but for liberation from material bondage. Now Uddhava presents some intermediate questions that must be answered so the path of liberation will be clear. Different philosophers have historically disagreed over the exact number of material elements, about the existence and nonexistence of particular external objects and about the existence of the soul itself. The jïäna-käëòa section of the Vedas aims at liberation through analytic understanding of the material world and of the spirit soul as a transcendental element beyond matter. Ultimately the Supreme Lord Himself stands above all elements and maintains them by His personal potency. Uddhava mentions in numerical terms different methodologies of various sages, citing first the Lord's own opinion. The word äyuñman, or "possessing eternal form," is significant in this regard. Since Lord Kåñëa is eternal, He possesses all knowledge of past, present and future and is thus the original and supreme philosopher.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the different analytic approaches mentioned by Çré Uddhava are actually not contradictory, since they are different methods of categorizing the same reality. Atheistic speculation on reality does not recognize the existence of God; consequently it is a worthless attempt to explain the truth. The Lord Himself empowers different living entities to speculate and speak on reality in different ways. The actual reality, however, is the Lord Himself, who will now speak to Çré Uddhava.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Lord Kåñëa replied: Because all material elements are present everywhere, it is reasonable that different learned brähmaëas have analyzed them in different ways. All such philosophers spoke under the shelter of My mystic potency, and thus they could say anything without contradicting the truth.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The words santi sarvatra in this verse indicate that all material elements are found within each other in gross and subtle forms. In this way there are innumerable ways to categorically describe them. The material world is ultimately illusory, undergoing constant transformation. It may be measured in different ways, just as the mirage of an oasis may be described in different ways, but the Lord's own analysis of twenty-eight elements is perfect and should be accepted. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé states that the word mäyä in this verse does not refer to mahä-mäyä, or the potency of ignorance, but to the Lord's inconceivable mystic power, which shelters the learned followers of Vedic knowledge. Each of the philosophers mentioned here reveals a particular aspect of truth, and their theories are not contradictory, since they are simply describing the same phenomena with different categorical systems. Such philosophical disagreement is endless within the material world; thus everyone should unite on the platform of the Lord's own opinion, as stated in this verse. Similarly, in Bhagavad-gétä Lord Kåñëa requests all conditioned souls to give up their various forms of worship and surrender unto Him in full Kåñëa consciousness, becoming His devotees. Thus the whole universe can be united in love of Godhead by chanting Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. By the Lord's revealing Himself to a sincere devotee, the controversy of analytic philosophy is ended.</div>

Such logical or rational proposing, doubting, counter-proposing, counteracting, etc., take thousands of different forms and become the basis of argument. Actually, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa, is the basis of all existence, since everything emanates from the Lord, is maintained by the Lord and at the end is merged to rest within the Lord. Lord Kåñëa is para-tattva, the highest truth underlying all other dependent truths. In a society of learned persons who have understood the Personality of Godhead to be everything, there is no further cause of philosophical quarrel. Such unity of opinion is not based on the absence of philosophical inquiry, nor on the stifling of rational discussion, but is the natural result of spiritual enlightenment. So-called philosophers proudly boast that they are searching and researching for the Absolute Truth, yet they somehow consider one who has found the Absolute Truth to be less intelligent than one who has not found it but is searching. Because Lord Kåñëa is the Absolute Truth, one who fully surrenders to the Lord becomes the most learned person.</div>

The example may be given that we find the dormant existence of an earthen pot within mud and also the existence of mud within the earthen pot. Similarly, one element is present within another, and ultimately all elements rest within the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is simultaneously within everything. By such explanations, Kåñëa consciousness constitutes the ultimate scientific methodology for factually understanding this universe.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Although the Lord tolerates different methods of calculating material causes within their effects and material effects within their causes, there cannot be any speculation regarding the two spiritual elements found in this universe, namely the individual soul and the Supersoul. Lord Kåñëa clearly states in this verse that the living entity is incapable of effecting his own enlightenment. The Supreme Lord is tattva-jïa, omniscient, and jïäna-da, the spiritual master of the entire universe. Çré Uddhava mentioned that some philosophers describe twenty-five elements and others twenty-six. The difference is that the twenty-six elements include a separate category for the individual soul and the Supreme Soul, Lord Kåñëa, whereas the proponents of twenty-five elements artificially merge the two transcendental categories of jéva-tattva and viñëu-tattva, hiding the eternal supremacy of the Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="First"> Knowledge based on the three modes of material nature cannot rise to the transcendental platform, where the Personality of Godhead exists as the supreme enjoyer of eternal spiritual varieties of form, color, flavor, musical sounds and loving affairs. Mundane philosophers simply bounce back and forth between material enjoyment and material renunciation. Being victims of Mäyäväda (impersonal) perception of the Absolute Truth, they cannot achieve the shelter of the Personality of Godhead and thus cannot understand Him. Because foolish, impersonal philosophers consider themselves supreme, they are unable to appreciate that loving service exists on the spiritual platform. Stubbornly rejecting subservience to the Personality of Godhead, the impersonalists are eventually overwhelmed by the illusory potency of the Lord and undergo the miseries of material existence. The Vaiñëavas, on the other hand, are not envious of the Personality of Godhead. They gladly accept His shelter and supremacy, and thus the Lord personally takes charge of His devotees and enlightens them, filling them with His own transcendental bliss. Spiritual service to the Supreme Lord is in this way free from the disappointment and repression of material service.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> According to knowledge in the material mode of goodness, there is no qualitative difference between the living entity and the supreme controller. The imagination of qualitative difference between them is useless speculation.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to certain philosophers there are twenty-five elements, among which a single category is stipulated for both the individual living entity and the Supreme Lord. Such impersonal knowledge is declared by the Lord to be material: jïänaà ca prakåter guëaù. Such knowledge can, however, be accepted to establish the qualitative identity of the Supreme Lord and the living entities who expand from Him. Materialistic persons sometimes believe that there is a supreme spirit in heaven but also think that human beings are identical with their material bodies and thus qualitatively and perpetually separated from the Supreme Lord. Knowledge of the Lord's qualitative oneness with the living entity, as described in this verse, refutes the materialistic concept of life and partially establishes the Absolute Truth. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu described the actual situation as acintya-bhedäbheda-tattva(96): the supreme controller and the controlled living entities are simultaneously one and different. In the material mode of goodness the oneness is perceived. As one proceeds further, to the stage of viçuddha-sattva, or purified spiritual goodness, one finds spiritual variety within the qualitative oneness, completing one's knowledge of the Absolute Truth. The words na vailakñaëyam aëv api boldly affirm that the individual living entity is indisputably part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and qualitatively one with Him. Any philosophical attempt to separate the living entity from the Supreme Lord and deny his eternal servitude to the Lord is thus refuted. Speculation arriving at the conclusion that the living entity has independent existence separate from the Lord is described here as apärthä, useless. Nevertheless, the theory of twenty-five elements is acceptable to the Lord as a preliminary phase in the evolution of spiritual knowledge.</div>

<div class="First"> The three modes of nature, in their original state of equilibrium, as well as the subsequent creation generated from the modes, are vastly more powerful than the tiny living entity who is controlled by them. The living entity thus cannot be accepted as the actual doer or creator within the material world. The mode of goodness is symptomized by the experience of knowledge, the mode of passion by the experience of work, and the mode of ignorance by the experience of darkness. These modes of material knowledge, work and darkness have no real relation with the transcendental spirit soul, who exhibits his own qualities of eternality, bliss and knowledge (the sandhiné, saàvit and hlädiné potencies of the Supreme Lord). The material modes have no access within the kingdom of God, in the unbounded atmosphere of which the eternal living entity is meant to live.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The impetus for the interaction of the material elements is the forward movement of time. Because time is passing, the embryo grows within the womb, gradually comes out, grows up, produces by-products, dwindles and dies. All of this is due to the pushing of time. In the absence of the time factor, the material elements do not interact but remain inert in the form of pradhäna. Lord Kåñëa is establishing the basic categories of the material world so that human beings can conceive of the Lord's creation. Were the categories not condensed, analysis and conceptualization would be impossible, since the Lord's potencies are infinite. Although there are numerous divisions of material elements within the basic divisions, the spirit soul is always to be understood as a distinct transcendental element, meant for residence in the kingdom of God.</div>

Within material nature the living entity becomes a false enjoyer, forgetting his subservience to the Lord. The material elements as well as the living entity and the Supersoul are thus systematically analyzed to demonstrate to the conditioned soul his actual constitutional position beyond material nature.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çré Uddhava here expresses the doubt that arises in the heart of an ordinary conditioned soul. Although the Vedic scriptures declare that the material body is a temporary fabrication of the material modes of nature, the conscious living entity within the body is actually an eternal spirit soul. In Bhagavad-gétä Lord Kåñëa has declared the material elements constituting the body to be His separated, inferior energy, whereas the living entity is the superior, conscious energy of the Lord. Still, in conditioned life the material body and conditioned soul appear inseparable and thus nondifferent. Because the living entity enters the womb of a mother and gradually comes out in a developed body, the soul appears to have entered deeply within material nature. Similarly, by the soul's identification with the material body, the body appears to enter deeply within the consciousness of the soul. What is more, the body cannot exist without the presence of the soul. By this apparent mutual dependence, the difference between the body and soul is obscured. Çré Uddhava therefore questions the Lord in order to clarify this issue.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word puruña indicates the living entity and also the Supreme Lord, who is the supreme living entity. Material nature, subject to transformation, is full of duality, whereas the Lord is one and absolute. Material nature is dependent on its creator, maintainer and annihilator; the Lord, however, is completely self-reliant and independent. In the same way, material nature is unconscious and dull, lacking self-awareness, whereas the Supreme Lord is self-sufficient omniscience. The individual living entity shares the eternality, bliss and knowledge of the Personality of Godhead and is also completely distinct from material nature.</div>
<div class="First"> The word sarga here refers to the material amalgamation of the body, which covers the living entity. The material body undergoes constant transformation and is thus clearly different from the living entity, who is eternally the same. In the transcendental kingdom of God there is no conflict or agitation caused by creation, maintenance and destruction as exhibited in the material world. There all variety is resolved in the transcendental loving experience of Kåñëa consciousness, the natural constitutional position of the soul.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Sight, visible form and the reflected image of the sun within the aperture of the eye all work together to reveal one another. But the original sun standing in the sky is self-manifested. Similarly, the Supreme Soul, the original cause of all entities, who is thus separate from all of them, acts by the illumination of His own transcendental experience as the ultimate source of manifestation of all mutually manifesting objects.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Form is recognized by the function of the eye, and the eye's function is understood by the presence of perceivable form. This interaction of sight and form further depends on the presence of light provided by the demigods, whose service of universal management depends on the presence of those who are to be managed, namely the living entities experiencing form with their eyes. Thus the three factors-adhyätma, represented by the senses such as the eye; adhibhüta, the sense objects such as form; and adhidaiva, the influence of the controlling deities—exist in an interdependent relationship. The sun globe itself is said to be self-manifest, self-luminous and self-experiencing; it does not share the interdependence of the senses and sense objects although facilitating their function. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead facilitates the interdependent experiences of all living entities. For example, newspapers, radio and television reveal world events to the mass of people. Parents reveal facts about life to their children, teachers to their students, friends to friends, and so on. The government manifests its will to the people and the people to their government. The sun and moon reveal the visual forms of all objects, and the perception of sound reveals audible form. The vibrations of particular types of music or rhetoric reveal the inner feelings of other living beings, and other types of knowledge are revealed by aroma, touch and taste. In this way, through the interaction of the senses and mind with innumerable sense objects, different types of knowledge are acquired. All such informative interactions, however, depend upon the supreme illuminating power of the Personality of Godhead. As stated in Brahma-saàhitä (5.52), yac-cakñur eña savitä sakala-grahäëäm: "Among all the planets the sun is considered the eye of the Supreme Lord." The Personality of Godhead is eternally omniscient by His own transcendental potency, and thus no one can reveal anything to the Lord about anything. Still, Lord Kåñëa humbly accepts our prayers offered in Kåñëa consciousness. In conclusion, Lord Kåñëa clearly explains here that His sublime characteristics are completely different from those of the manifest universe. The Lord is therefore the supreme transcendental entity, free from all material influence.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Similarly, the sense organs, namely the skin, ears, eyes, tongue and nose—as well as the functions of the subtle body, namely conditioned consciousness, mind, intelligence and false ego—can all be analyzed in terms of the threefold distinction of sense, object of perception and presiding deity.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The individual soul has no permanent relationship with the inter dependent material functions of the senses, sense objects and controlling deities. The living entity is originally pure spirit soul and is meant to depend on the Personality of Godhead in the spiritual world. It is useless to try to analyze matter and spirit within the same categories, since they belong to different potencies of the Supreme Lord. Thus the act of spiritually perceiving the Supreme Lord, His abode and one's own self is an entirely antimaterial process realized within pure Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> If one doubts the existence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one will inevitably doubt the reality of the Lord's creation. Thus, without understanding Lord Kåñëa, mere argument and debate over the reality and nonreality of the material world are useless. The material world is real specifically because it emanates from the supreme reality, Lord Kåñëa. Without understanding the reality of Lord Kåñëa one can never definitely ascertain the reality of His creation; one will always wonder if he is actually seeing something or merely thinking that he is seeing it. This kind of speculation can never be resolved without taking shelter of the Supreme Lord and is therefore useless. The devotees of the Lord are not inclined to such argument, because they are factually advancing in spiritual enlightenment and are fully satisfied with their progressively more beautiful experience of Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

Thus they concoct varieties of philosophies according to their positions within the modes of nature.

Liberation is achieved by perfect knowledge coming from the spiritual platform, the kingdom of God.

<div class="First"> One may ask how the subtle body, or mind, gives up its connection with one physical body and enters another. Such entering and leaving of physical bodies is called birth and death by conditioned souls. One utilizes his present senses to meditate on the visible objects of this world—beautiful women, palatial estates, and so on—and similarly one daydreams about the heavenly planets described in the Vedas. As death occurs, the mind is pulled away from the objects of its immediate experience and enters another body to experience a new set of sense objects. As the mind undergoes total reorientation there is the apparent loss of one's previous mentality and creation of a new mind, though actually the same mind is experiencing, but in a different way. The conditioned soul is overwhelmed by the constant flow of material experience consisting of direct perception and abstract contemplation of the objects of this world. One thereby loses his transcendental memory of his relationship with God. As soon as one identifies with this world he forgets his eternal identity and surrenders to the false ego created by mäyä.</div>

<div class="Translation"> When the living entity passes from the present body to the next body, which is created by his own karma, he becomes absorbed in the pleasurable and painful sensations of the new body and completely forgets the experience of the previous body. This total forgetfulness of one's previous material identity, which comes about for one reason or another, is called death.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Depending on one's karma, or fruitive activities, one may achieve a beautiful, wealthy or powerful body or be degraded to an abominable condition of life. Taking birth in heaven or in hell, the living entity learns to completely identify his ego with the new body and thus becomes absorbed in the pleasure, fear, opulence or suffering of the new body, completely forgetting the experiences of the previous body. Death occurs when the specific karma allotted to a physical body is finished. Since that particular body's karma is used up, it can no longer act upon one's mind; in that way one forgets the previous body. The new body is created by nature so that one can experience the karma currently in effect. Consequently one's entire consciousness becomes absorbed in one's current body in order that one can fully experience the results of his previous activities. Because the living entity falsely identifies himself as the body, bodily death is experienced as death of the soul. Actually, however, the soul is eternal and is never subject to creation or annihilation. This analytic knowledge of self-realization is easily understood in Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Identification with one's material body surpasses the mere affection and attachment one feels for the bodies of relatives or friends. The word sarva-bhävena here shows that one totally accepts the material body to be oneself, just as one completely accepts the experience of a dream as real. Mere imagination without practical action is called a daydream; the mental concoction that occurs in a sleeping state is called a dream. Our identification with our own body and our blind acceptance of bodily relationships as permanent constitute a prolonged form of dreaming or fantasy in which one imagines oneself to be separate from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The term birth, therefore, does not refer to the generation of a new entity but to the blind acceptance by the spirit soul of a new material body.</div>

A father may by nature be peaceful, but because his bad son gets into trouble the father is forced to defend his son and consider his son's enemies to be enemies of the entire family. Thus the bad son implicates the father in troublesome conflicts. Similarly, the spirit soul has no intrinsic problems, but by creating a false identification with the material body the soul becomes involved in the happiness and distress of the body. With this verse the Lord summarizes His discussion of the difference between the body and the soul.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> The different stages of transformation of all material bodies occur just like those of the flame of a candle, the current of a river, or the fruits of a tree.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The wavering flame of a candle sometimes waxes brightly and again becomes weak. Finally it vanishes altogether. The waves of a flowing river rise and fall, creating innumerable shapes and patterns. The fruits of a tree gradually take birth, grow, ripen, sweeten and eventually rot and die. Similarly, one can easily understand that one's own body is undergoing constant transformation, and that the body is certainly subject to old age, disease and death. At different times of life the body exhibits degrees of sexual potency, physical strength, desire, wisdom and so on. As the body grows old, physical strength diminishes, but one's knowledge may increase even as the body undergoes such transformation.</div>
<div class="First"> Material birth and death occur within the realm of segmented time. The birth, creation or production of a material object immediately connects it with a segmented sequence of subtle time within the material world. Thus its destruction or death is inevitable. The irresistible force of time moves so subtly that only the most intelligent can perceive it. Just as the candle flame gradually diminishes, as the flowing currents move within the river or as fruits gradually ripen on a tree, the material body is steadily moving toward inevitable death. The temporary body should therefore never be confused with the eternal, unchanging spirit soul.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Although the illumination of a lamp consists of innumerable rays of light undergoing constant creation, transformation and destruction, a person with illusory intelligence who sees the light for a moment will speak falsely, saying, "This is the light of the lamp." As one observes a flowing river, ever-new water passes by and goes far away, yet a foolish person, observing one point in the river, falsely states, "This is the water of the river." Similarly, although the material body of a human being is constantly undergoing transformation, those who are simply wasting their lives falsely think and say that each particular stage of the body is the person's real identity</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Although one may say, "This is the light of the lamp," there are innumerable rays of light being created, transformed and destroyed at every moment; and although one may speak of the water of the river, there is an ever-new supply of different water molecules passing by. Similarly, when one meets a young child, one accepts that particular transitory phase of the body as the actual identity of the person, considering him to be a child. One also considers an old body to be an old person. In fact, however, the material body of a human being, just like the waves of a river or the radiation of a lamp, is merely a transformation of the three modes of material nature, the potency of the Supreme Lord. The real identity of a person is spirit soul, part and parcel of Lord Kåñëa, but as Lord Kåñëa proves in this verse, a conditioned soul is incapable of observing or understanding the subtle movements of time. With the gross vision of material consciousness one cannot ascertain the subtle segments of material manifestation, which are impelled by the Lord Himself as time. The word måñäyuñäm in this verse indicates those who are uselessly wasting their time in ignorance without understanding the instructions of the Lord. Such persons gullibly accept any particular phase of the body to be the actual identity of the spirit soul within the body. Because the spirit soul is not subject to material transformation, when he engages himself in the eternal variegated pleasure of Kåñëa consciousness, loving service to the Supreme Lord, he will experience no further ignorance and suffering.</div>

<div class="Translation"> A person does not actually take birth out of the seed of past activities, nor, being immortal, does he die. By illusion the living being appears to be born and to die, just as fire in connection with firewood appears to begin and then cease to exist.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The element fire exists perpetually within the material creation, but in connection with a particular piece of wood fire apparently comes into existence and ceases to exist. Similarly, the living entity is eternal, but in connection with a particular body apparently takes birth and dies. The reactions of karma thus impose an illusory suffering or enjoyment upon the living entity, but they do not cause the entity himself to change his eternal nature. In other words, karma represents a cycle of illusion in which each illusory activity produces another. Kåñëa consciousness stops this cycle of karma by engaging the living being in spiritual activities in the loving service of the Lord. By such Kåñëa consciousness one can escape the illusory chain of fruitive reactions.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The Lord has described the nine stages of the material body, beginning with impregnation, gestation and birth. One may argue that a living entity cannot remember his presence in the mother's womb nor his birth and early infancy. The Lord therefore states here that one can experience these phases of bodily existence by studying one's own child. Similarly, although one may hope to live forever, by experiencing the death of one's father, grandfather or great-grandfather, one has definite proof that the material body will die. A sober person, knowing the soul to be eternal, therefore gives up false identification with the temporary, unreliable body and takes shelter of the devotional service of the Lord. By this process one can escape the artificial imposition of birth and death.</div>

Although different from the material body and never the actual performer of its activities, the conditioned soul is induced to engage his body in material activities, which entangle him in the cycle of birth and death.

<div class="First"> One may object that if Lord Kåñëa insists that material life is false, then why should one endeavor to stop it? The Lord therefore explains here that although not factual, material life stubbornly continues for one addicted to sense gratification, just as a frightening dream continues for one merged in sleep. The word avidyamäna, "not existing," means that material life is based on mental concoction, in which one thinks, "I am a man," "I am a woman," "I am a doctor," "I am a senator," "I am a street sweeper" and so on. A conditioned soul enthusiastically performs his activities based on the imaginary identification with the body. Thus although the spirit soul exists and the body exists, the false identification with the body does not exist. Material life, based on a false idea, has no factual existence.</div>

<div class="First"> Everything that exists is the potency and property of the Supreme Lord, meant to be used in His loving service. Seeing material objects as separate from the Lord and thus meant to be possessed and enjoyed by oneself is called vaikalpikaà bhramam, the illusion of material duality. When selecting one's personal object of enjoyment, such as food, clothing, residence or vehicle, one considers the relative quality of the object to be acquired. Consequently, in material life one is in constant anxiety, trying to acquire the most excellent sense gratification for one's personal pleasure. If one realizes everything as the property of the Lord, however, he will see everything as meant for the Lord's pleasure. He will feel no personal anxiety, because he is satisfied simply to be engaged in the Lord's loving service. It is not possible to exploit the property of the Lord and at the same time advance in self-realization.</div>

<div class="Translation"> O soul of the universe, the conditioning of one's personality in material life is very strong, and therefore it is very difficult even for learned men to tolerate the offenses committed against them by ignorant people. Only Your devotees, who are fixed in Your loving service and who have achieved peace by residing at Your lotus feet, are able to tolerate such offenses.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Unless one becomes advanced in the process of hearing and chanting the glories of the Supreme Lord, theoretical learning cannot make one actually saintly. One's conditioned personality, the result of long material association, is very difficult to overcome. Therefore we should humbly take shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, who has so wonderfully explained to Çré Uddhava the real meaning of knowledge.</div>
<div class="First"> Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Twenty-second Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Enumeration of the Elements of Material Creation."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 23. The Song of the Avanté Brähmaëa.</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter tells the story of a mendicant sannyäsé from the Avanté country as an example of how one should tolerate the disturbances and offenses created by evil persons.</div>
<div class="First"> The harsh words of uncouth persons pierce the heart even more severely than arrows. Yet a mendicant brähmaëa from the city of Avanté, even while being attacked by wicked men, considered this trouble to be simply the consequence of his own past deeds and tolerated it with utmost sobriety. Previously the brähmaëa had been an agriculturalist and merchant. He had been extremely greedy, miserly and prone to anger. As a result, his wife, sons, daughters, relatives and servants were all deprived of every kind of enjoyment and gradually came to behave unaffectionately toward him. In due course of time, thieves, family members and providence took away the sum total of his wealth. Finding himself without any property and abandoned by everyone, the brähmaëa developed a deep sense of renunciation.</div>
<div class="First"> He considered how the earning and preservation of wealth involve great effort, fear, anxiety and confusion. Because of wealth, there arise fifteen unwanted items-thievery, violence, lying, deception, lust, anger, pride, feverishness, disagreement, hatred, distrust, conflict, attachment to women, gambling and intoxication. When this meditation arose in his heart, the brähmaëa could understand that the Supreme Lord Çré Hari had somehow become satisfied with him. He felt that only because the Lord was pleased with him had the apparently unfavorable turn of events in his life occurred. He was grateful that a sense of detachment had arisen in his heart and considered it the factual means for delivering his soul. In this condition he determined to engage the duration of his life in the worship of Lord Hari and thus accepted the mendicant order of tridaëòi-sannyäsa. Subsequently, he would enter different villages to beg charity, but the people would harass and disturb him. But he simply tolerated all this, remaining firm as a mountain. He remained fixed in his chosen spiritual practice and sang a song renowned as the Bhikñu-géta.</div>
<div class="First"> Neither mortal persons, the demigods, the soul, the ruling planets, the reactions of work nor time are the causes of one's happiness and distress. Rather, the mind alone is their cause, because it is the mind that makes the spirit soul wander in the cycle of material life. The real purpose of all charity, religiosity and so forth is to bring the mind under control. A person who has already composed his mind in meditation has no need for these other processes, and for a person who is incapable of fixing his mind they are of no practical use. The false conception of material ego binds the transcendental soul to material sense objects. The Avanté brähmaëa therefore became determined to bring himself over the insurmountable ocean of material existence by rendering service to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, Mukunda, with the same perfect faith in the Lord exhibited by the great devotees of the past.</div>
<div class="First"> Only when one can focus his intelligence on the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can the mind be completely subdued; this is the essence of all practical prescriptions for spiritual advancement.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura comments as follows. "Often those who give up the materialistic path and devote themselves to renunciation are attacked by impious persons. This analysis, however, is superficial, since the punishment is actually the cumulative result of one's past karma. Some renunciants show lack of tolerance when presented with the remnants of their previous sins and thus are forced to enter again onto the path of impious life. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu therefore instructs that one should become as tolerant as a tree. If a neophyte on the path of devotional service to the Lord's pure devotees is attacked by envious persons, he must accept it as a consequence of his previous fruitive activities. One should be intelligent and avoid future unhappiness by rejecting the ethic of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. If one refuses to enter into enmity with envious men, they will automatically leave him alone."</div>

Effects of time here refers to the destruction of agricultural crops through seasonal irregularities and other such occurrences. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura points out that one should not merely proclaim oneself to be a brähmaëa but should actually understand one's original identity as a servant of the Lord. One declaring himself to be a brähmaëa but maintaining a materialistic mentality is not a real brähmaëa, but rather a brahma-bandhu, or so-called brähmaëa. The humble devotees of Lord Viñëu, following the indications of the Vedic scriptures, refer to themselves as unfortunate and unable to understand the kingdom of God; they do not proudly proclaim themselves to be brähmaëas. Those who are wise, however, know that such humble devotees are actually brähmaëas whose hearts are cleansed by the pure mode of goodness.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura comments as follows. "Human birth is better than that of the demigods, ghosts, spirits, animals, trees, lifeless stones, and so forth, because the demigods simply enjoy celestial pleasures, and in other forms of life there is excessive suffering. It is only in human life that one deeply considers one's ultimate benefit in life. Human birth is therefore more desirable than even that of the demigods." Within human life the position of a high-class brähmaëa is certainly most desirable. If a brähmaëa, however, gives up the devotional service of the Lord and works hard like a çüdra simply for the prestige of his community, he is certainly on the platform of material sense gratification. The special qualification of the brähmaëas is the spiritual knowledge by which they recognize every living entity to be an eternal servant of the Lord. A brähmaëa, free from false ego, thus feels himself lower than a blade of grass and tolerantly offers respect to all living entities. All human beings, and especially the brähmaëas, should avoid becoming killers of their own self-interest by neglecting Kåñëa consciousness, the loving service of the Lord. Such neglect paves the way for future suffering.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> That which one intends to use for one's personal sense gratification is called material property, whereas paraphernalia to be used in the Lord's loving service is understood to be spiritual. One should give up all one's material property by utilizing it completely in the devotional service of the Lord. A person who owns a luxurious mansion should install the Deity of the Lord and hold regular programs to propagate Kåñëa consciousness. Similarly, wealth should be used to build temples of the Lord and publish literature scientifically explaining the Personality of Godhead. One who blindly renounces material property without utilizing it in the service of the Lord does not understand that everything belongs to the Personality of Godhead. Such blind renunciation is based on the material idea that "This property could belong to me, but I don't want it." Everything, in fact, belongs to God; knowing this one neither tries to enjoy nor to reject the things of this world, but peacefully engages them in the service of the Lord.</div>

Mahäräja Khaöväìga, as described in the Second Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, fought valiantly on behalf of the demigods, and they offered the king any benediction he might desire.

<div class="First"> According to Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura, the acceptance of the tridaëòi-sannyäsa order of life is the chief indication that one has actually taken shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The three rods of the daëòa, or staff, of the Vaiñëava sannyäsé indicate control of the body, mind and words by engaging them only in the loving service of the Lord. This procedure helps one to become more tolerant than a tree, as recommended by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. By strict control of one's body, mind and speech, the quality of tolerance becomes strengthened, and thus one manifests the further qualities of forgiving others, never wasting one's time, detachment from sense gratification, lack of false pride in one's work and not hankering for liberation. One in this way gives up the mentality of materialistic persons, who establish so-called affectionate relationships of mutual flattery and exploit each other for sense gratification. One who adopts the strict path of Kåñëa consciousness, following in the footsteps of great souls, can achieve the shelter of the Lord.</div>

The brähmaëa realized that his suffering was due to his false identification with his material body, and not to the interaction of his body with external phenomena. Rather than try to adjust his external situation, he tried to adjust his Kåñëa consciousness and thus realize his actual identity as eternal spirit soul.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In the mode of goodness one considers oneself to be a saintly or wise person, in the mode of passion one struggles for material success, and in the mode of ignorance one becomes cruel, lazy and sinful. By the combination of the material modes one identifies oneself as a demigod, a king, a rich capitalist, a wise scholar, etc. These conceptions are material designations generated from the modes of nature, and they arrange themselves according to the tendency of the powerful mind to enjoy temporary sense gratification. The word baléyas in this verse, meaning "very strong," indicates that the material mind becomes insensitive to intelligent advice. Even if we are informed that we are committing many sins and offenses in order to earn money, we may still think that money should be acquired at all costs, since without it one can neither perform religious ceremonies nor gratify the senses with beautiful women, mansions and vehicles. Once the money is achieved, one suffers further problems, but the stubborn mind will never heed good advice in this regard. One must therefore give up mental concoction and control the mind in Kåñëa consciousness, as exemplified here by the brähmaëa from Avanté.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Although bodily pleasure and pain are felt by the soul, one must tolerate such duality, understanding it to be a creation of one's own material mind. If one accidentally bites his own tongue or lip, he cannot become angry and pull out his own teeth. Similarly, all living beings are individual parts and parcels of God, and thus nondifferent from each other. All of them are meant to serve the Supreme Lord in spiritual equality. If the living beings give up their master's service and instead quarrel among themselves, they will be forced to suffer by the laws of nature. If the conditioned souls establish artificial relationships of affection based on the material body and having nothing to do with God, then time itself will destroy such relationships, and they will be subjected to further suffering. But if the individual living entities understand each other to be of the same family, all having connection with the Supreme Lord, their mutual friendship will develop. Thus one should not exhibit anger that will be harmful to oneself and others. Although the brähmaëa was receiving kind offerings of charity from some people and being harassed and beaten by others, he denied that these people were the ultimate cause of his happiness and distress, for he was fixed on the platform of self-realization beyond the material body and mind.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The brähmaëa is elaborately explaining the condition of self-realization, in which one understands oneself to be totally distinct from the material body and mind and the demigods who control them. By cultivating bodily happiness we are forced to accept bodily pain. Foolish conditioned souls endeavor to eliminate distress and enjoy happiness, but material happiness and distress are two sides of the same coin. One cannot relish bodily happiness without identifying oneself as the body. But as soon as such identification occurs, one is harassed by the innumerable pains and sufferings also inevitably present within the same body. Bodily happiness and distress are administered by the demigods, who can never be brought under our control; thus one remains subject to the whims of providence on the material platform. If, however, one surrenders to the Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa, the reservoir of all pleasure, one can reach the spiritual platform, where transcendental bliss enlivens the liberated souls without any interrupting anxiety or unhappiness.</div>

Therefore, since happiness and distress do not actually exist in this concept, why become angry at oneself or others?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Because a dead body does not feel pleasure or pain, our happiness and distress are due to our own consciousness, which is the nature of the soul. It is not, however, the original function of the soul to enjoy material happiness and suffer material distress. These are produced by ignorant material affection and enmity based on false ego. Our involvement in sense gratification drags our consciousness into the material body, where it is shocked by the inevitable bodily pains and problems.</div>
<div class="First"> On the spiritual platform there is neither material happiness nor distress because there the living consciousness is fully engaged, without personal desire, in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. This is the actual position of happiness, aloof from false bodily identification. Rather than uselessly becoming enraged with others for one's own foolishness, one should take to self-realization and solve the problems of life.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> If we assume that fruitive work is the cause of happiness and distress, we still are not dealing with the soul. The idea of material work arises when there is a spiritual actor who is conscious and a material body that undergoes the transformation of happiness and distress as a reaction to such work. Since the body has no life, it cannot be the actual recipient of happiness and distress, nor can the soul, who is ultimately completely spiritual and aloof from the material body. Since karma thus has no ultimate basis in either the body or the soul, at whom can one become angry?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The material body is composed of earth, water, fire and air, just like bricks, stones and other objects. Our consciousness, falsely absorbed in the body, experiences happiness and distress, and fruitive work (karma) is performed when we falsely consider ourselves to be the enjoyers of the material world. False ego is thus the illusory combination within our minds of the self and the body, which are actually two separate objects. Since karma, or material work, is based on illusory consciousness, these activities are also illusory and have no factual basis in either the body or the soul. When a conditioned soul falsely considers himself to be the body, and consequently the enjoyer of the material world, he tries to find pleasure in illicit connection with women. Such sinful activity is based on his false concept of being the body and thus the enjoyer of women and of the world. Since he is not the body, his activity of enjoying a woman does not actually exist. There is merely the interaction of two machines, namely the two bodies, and the interaction of the illusory consciousness of the man and woman. The sensation of illicit sex occurs within the material body and is falsely assimilated by the false ego as its own experience. Thus the miserable or pleasurable reactions of karma ultimately act upon the false ego and not upon the body, which is composed of dull matter, nor upon the soul, which has nothing to do with matter. False ego is the illusory concoction of the mind; it is specifically this false ego that is suffering happiness and distress. The soul cannot become angry at others, since he is not personally enjoying or suffering. Rather, the false ego is doing this.</div>

It is only when transcendental consciousness falsely identifies with dull matter that the living entity imagines he is enjoying and suffering in the material world. This illusory identification of consciousness with matter is called false ego and is the cause of material existence.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The false ego gives shape to illusory material existence and thus experiences material happiness and distress. The spirit soul, however, is transcendental to material nature; he can never actually be affected by material happiness and distress in any place, under any circumstance or by the agency of any person. A person who understands this has nothing whatsoever to fear from the material creation.</div>

<div class="First"> The brähmaëa has refuted six specific explanations of the happiness and distress of the living entity, and now he refutes any other explanation that might be given. On the basis of false ego, the bodily covering factually overwhelms the spirit soul, and thus one falsely enjoys and suffers that which has no real relationship with oneself. One who can understand this sublime teaching of the brähmaëa, spoken by the Lord to Uddhava, will never again suffer the terrible anxiety of fear within the material world.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> This verse is quoted by Kåñëadäsa Kaviräja in his Caitanya-caritämåta (Madhya 3.6). Çréla Prabhupäda comments as follows. "In connection with this verse, which is a quotation from Çrémad-Bhägavatam (11.23.57), Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura says that of the sixty-four items required for rendering devotional service, acceptance of the symbolic marks of sannyäsa is a regulative principle. If one accepts the sannyäsa order, his main business is to devote his life completely to the service of Mukunda, Kåñëa. If one does not completely devote his mind and body to the service of the Lord, he does not actually become a sannyäsé. It is not simply a matter of changing dress. In Bhagavad-gétä (6.1) it is also stated, anäçritaù karma-phalaà käryaà karma karoti yaù/ sa sannyäsé ca yogé ca: one who works devotedly for the satisfaction of Kåñëa is a sannyäsé. The dress is not sannyäsa, but the attitude of service to Kåñëa is.</div>
<div class="First"> "The word parätma-niñöhä means being a devotee of Lord Kåñëa. Parätmä, the Supreme Person, is Kåñëa. Éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù [Bs. 5.1]. Those who are completely dedicated to the lotus feet of Kåñëa in service are actually sannyäsés. As a matter of formality, the devotee accepts the sannyäsa dress as previous äcäryas did. He also accepts the three daëòas. Later Viñëu Svämé considered that accepting the dress of a tri-daëòé was parätma-niñöhä. Therefore sincere devotees add another daëòa, the jéva-daëòa, to the three existing daëòas. The Vaiñëava sannyäsé is known as a tridaëòi-sannyäsé. The Mäyävädé sannyäsé accepts only one daëòa, not understanding the purpose of tri-daëòa. Later, many persons in the community of Çiva Svämé gave up the ätma-niñöhä (devotional service) of the Lord and followed the path of Çaìkaräcärya. Instead of accepting 108 names, those in the Çiva Svämé sampradäya follow the path of Çaìkaräcärya and accept the ten names of sannyäsa. Although Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu accepted the then-existing order of sannyäsa (namely eka-daëòa), He still recited a verse from Çrémad-Bhägavatam about the tridaëòa-sannyäsa accepted by the brähmaëa of Avantépura. Indirectly He declared that within that ekadaëòa (one daëòa), four daëòas existed as one. Accepting ekadaëòa sannyäsa without parätma-niñöhä (devotional service to Lord Kåñëa) is not acceptable to Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. In addition, according to the exact regulative principles, one should add the jéva-daëòa to the tri-daëòa. These four daëòas, bound together as one, are symbolic of unalloyed devotional service to the Lord. Because the ekadaëòi-sannyäsés of the Mäyäväda school are not devoted to the service of Kåñëa, they try to merge into the Brahman effulgence, which is a marginal position between material and spiritual existence. They accept this impersonal position as liberation. Mäyävädé sannyäsés, not knowing that Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu was a tri-daëòé, think of Caitanya Mahäprabhu as an ekadaëòi-sannyäsé. This is due to their vivarta, bewilderment. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam there is no such thing as an ekadaëòi-sannyäsé; indeed, the tridaëòi-sannyäsé is accepted as the symbolic representation of the sannyäsa order. By citing this verse from Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu accepted the sannyäsa order recommended in Çrémad-Bhägavatam. The Mäyävädé sannyäsés, who are enamored of the external energy of the Lord, cannot understand the mind of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu. "To date, all the devotees of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, following in His footsteps, accept the sannyäsa order and keep the sacred thread and tuft of unshaved hair. The ekadaëòi-sannyäsés of the Mäyävädé school give up the sacred thread and do not keep any tuft of hair. Therefore they are unable to understand the purport of tridaëòa-sannyäsa, and as such they are not inclined to dedicate their lives to the service of Mukunda. They simply think of merging into the existence of Brahman because of their disgust with the material existence. The äcäryas who advocate the daiva-varëäçrama (the social order of cätur-varëyam mentioned in Bhagavad-gétä) do not accept the proposition of äsura-varëäçrama, which maintains that the social order of varëa is indicated by birth.</div>
<div class="First"> "The most intimate devotee of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, namely Gadädhara Paëòita, accepted the tridaëòa-sannyäsa and also accepted Mädhava Upädhyäya as his tridaëòi-sannyäsé disciple. It is said that from this Madhväcärya the sampradäya known in western India as the Vallabhäcärya-sampradäya has begun. Çréla Gopäla Bhaööa Vasu, who is known as a småty-äcärya in the Gauòéya Vaiñëava-sampradäya, later accepted the tridaëòa-sannyäsa order from Tridaëòipäda Prabodhänanda Sarasvaté. Although acceptance of tridaëòa-sannyäsa is not distinctly mentioned in the Gauòéya Vaiñëava literature, the first verse of Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé's Upadeçämåta advocates that one should accept the tridaëòa-sannyäsa order by controlling the six forces:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">väco vegaà manasaù krodha-vegaà</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">[NoI 1]</div>
<div class="First"> "One who can control the forces of speech, mind, anger, belly, tongue and genitals is known as a gosvämé and is competent to accept disciples all over the world.' The followers of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu never accepted the Mäyäväda order of sannyäsa, and for this they cannot be blamed. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu accepted Çrédhara Svämé, who was a tridaëòi-sannyäsé, but the Mäyävädé sannyäsés, not understanding Çrédhara Svämé, sometimes think that Çrédhara Svämé belonged to the Mäyäväda ekadaëòa-sannyäsa community. Actually this was not the case."</div>

Having received the Lord's mercy, he enlightened other conditioned souls with transcendental intelligence so that they could also follow in the footsteps of the devotees of the Lord. Religion actually means to become a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord in loving service. Those who are trying to enjoy the material world or merely renounce it to avoid personal inconvenience cannot actually understand love of Godhead, in which the only objective is the satisfaction of the Lord. Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C.

<div class="Chapnum"> 24. The Philosophy of Säìkhya</div>
<div class="First"> In this chapter Lord Kåñëa gives instruction how bewilderment of the mind can be dispelled by the science of Säìkhya. Herein the Supreme Lord again imparts to Uddhava instruction about the analysis of material nature. By assimilating this knowledge the spirit soul can drive away his confusion based on false dualities.</div>
<div class="First"> In the beginning of creation, the seer and seen are one and indistinguishable. This Supreme Absolute Truth, one without a second and inaccessible to words and mind, then separates into two-the seer, which means consciousness or personality, and the seen, which means substance or nature. The material nature, which comprises the three modes of matter, is agitated by the controlling male factor. The mahat-tattva then becomes manifest together with the energies of consciousness and activity. From these come the principle of false ego in its three aspects of goodness, passion and ignorance. From false ego in the mode of ignorance arise fifteen subtle forms of sense perception, followed by the fifteen physical elements. From false ego in the mode of passion come the ten senses, and from false ego in the mode of goodness come the mind and the eleven demigods who preside over the senses. By the conglomeration of all of these elements grows the universal egg, in the midst of which the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the creating Lord of the universe takes up residence in the role of indwelling Supersoul. From the navel of this ultimate creator comes a lotus, upon which Brahma takes birth. Lord Brahma, invested with the mode of passion, executes austerities by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and on the strength of these penances he is able to create all the planets of the universe. The region of heaven is meant for the demigods, that of inner space for ghostly spirits and that of the earth for human beings and others. In the region above these three planetary systems are the places of advanced sages, and in the lower worlds are those of the demons, Näga serpents and so forth. The goals achieved by activities based on the three modes of material nature are all within the three mortal worlds. The destinations of yoga, severe austerity and the renounced order of life are the worlds known as Mahar, Janas, Tapas and Satya. The goal of devotional service to the Supreme Lord, on the other hand, is the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead in His abode, Vaikuëöha. This universe of material action and reaction is constituted under the control of time and the three modes of material nature. Moreover, whatever exists in this universe is simply the product of the combination of material nature and her Lord. In the same way that creation proceeds gradually from the one and supremely subtle to the multitudinous and very gross, the process of annihilation proceeds from the grossest to the subtlest manifestation of nature, leaving only the eternal spiritual substance. This ultimate Soul remains situated within Himself, alone and without end. The mind of a person who meditates on these ideas does not become bewildered by material dualities. This science of Säìkhya, narrated in alternating sequences of creation and annihilation, serves to cut off all doubts and bondage.</div>

The Säìkhya philosophy system mentioned here is that presented by Lord Kapila in the Third Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam and not the atheistic Säìkhya presented later by materialists and Mäyävädés. The material elements, which emanate from the potency of the Lord, evolve in a progressive sequence. One should not foolishly think that such evolution begins from an original material element without the assistance of the Lord. This speculative theory is generated from the false ego of conditioned life and constitutes gross ignorance, unacceptable to the Personality of Godhead and His followers.</div>

<div class="First"> Kåta-yuga is the first age, also known as Satya-yuga, in which knowledge, being perfect, is not different from its object. In modern society, knowledge is highly speculative and constantly changing. There is often a vast difference between people's theoretical ideas and actual reality. In Satya-yuga, however, people are viveka-nipuëäù, or expert in intelligent discrimination, and thus there is no difference between their vision and reality. In Satya-yuga, the population in general is self-realized. Seeing everything as the potency of the Supreme Lord, they do not artificially create duality between themselves and other living entities. This is a further aspect of the oneness of Satya-yuga. At the time of annihilation, everything merges to rest within the Lord, and at that time also there is no difference between the Lord, who becomes the only seer, and the objects of knowledge, which are contained within the Lord. The liberated living entities in the eternal spiritual world are never subject to such merging but remain forever undisturbed in their spiritual forms. Because they are voluntarily one with the Lord in love, their abode is never annihilated.</div>

The modes of nature arise after the glance of the Lord and become inimical to one another, each mode attempting to conquer the other two. There is constant competition between birth, maintenance and annihilation. Although a child desires to take birth, the cruel mother may desire to kill the child through abortion. Although we may desire to kill the weeds in a field, they stubbornly take birth again and again. Similarly, we often desire to maintain our physical status quo, but still deterioration sets in. Thus there is constant competition among the modes of nature, and by their combinations and permutations the living entities try to enjoy innumerable material situations without Kåñëa consciousness. The word puruñänumatena indicates that the Lord sets the stage for such material futility so that the conditioned souls will eventually come back home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, sütra is the first transformation of material nature that manifests the potency of activity, and it is accompanied by the mahat-tattva, which is endowed with the potency of knowledge. In the material world, one's real knowledge is covered by fruitive activity and mental speculation. As one's devotional service to the Lord slackens, these two tendencies grow automatically, just as the diminishing of light automatically brings an increase in darkness.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word cid-acin-maya, "encompassing both spirit and matter," is significant in this regard. The false ego is the illusory combination of the eternal conscious soul and the temporary unconscious body. Because the spirit soul desires to exploit illicitly the creation of God, he is bewildered by the three modes of nature and assumes an illusory identity within the material world. Struggling to enjoy, he becomes more and more entangled in the complexities of illusion and only increases his anxiety. This hopeless situation can be overcome by taking to pure Kåñëa consciousness, in which the pleasure of the Supreme Lord becomes the only goal of one's life.</div>

Next, the sensation of touch, air and the sense of touch are generated, and thus from subtle to gross all of the elements and their perceptions are generated. The senses, because they are busily engaged in activity, are created from false ego in the mode of passion.

<div class="Translation"> By mystic yoga, great austerities and the renounced order of life, the pure destinations of Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka and Satyaloka are attained. But by devotional yoga, one achieves My transcendental abode.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains that the word tapasaù in this verse refers to austerities performed by brahmacärés and vänaprasthas. A brahmacäré who practices celibacy perfectly in some particular stage of his life achieves Maharloka, and one who perfectly practices lifelong celibacy achieves Janaloka. By perfect execution of vänaprastha one may achieve Tapoloka, and one in the renounced order of life goes to Satyaloka. These different destinations certainly depend on one's seriousness in the yoga system. In the Third Canto of the Bhägavatam, Lord Brahmä explains to the demigods, "The inhabitants of Vaikuëöha travel in their airplanes made of lapis lazuli, emeralds and gold. Although crowded by their consorts, who have large hips and beautiful smiling faces, they cannot be stimulated to passion by their mirth and beautiful charms." (SB 3.15.20) Thus in the spiritual world, the kingdom of God, the inhabitants have absolutely no desire for personal satisfaction, since they are completely satisfied in love of Godhead. Because they only think of the Lord's pleasure, there is no possibility of cheating, anxiety, lust, disappointment, and so on. As described in Bhagavad-gétä (18.62),</div>

<div class="Translation"> Gold and earth are originally existing as ingredients. From gold one may fashion golden ornaments such as bracelets and earrings, and from earth one may fashion clay pots and saucers. The original ingredients gold and earth exist before the products made from them, and when the products are eventually destroyed, the original ingredients, gold and earth, will remain. Thus, since the ingredients are present in the beginning and at the end, they must also be present in the middle phase, taking the form of a particular product to which we assign for convenience a particular name, such as bracelet, earring, pot or saucer. We can therefore understand that since the ingredient cause exists before the creation of a product and after the product's destruction, the same ingredient cause must be present during the manifest phase, supporting the product as the basis of its reality.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The Lord here explains that the original cause is certainly present in its effect, citing the example of gold and clay functioning as the causal ingredients of many different products in which gold and clay continue to be present.

<div class="Translation"> A material object, itself composed of an essential ingredient, creates another material object through transformation. Thus one created object becomes the cause and basis of another created object. A particular thing may thus be called real in that it possesses the basic nature of another object that constitutes its origin and final state.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> One may understand the purport of this verse through the simple analogy of a clay pot. A clay pot is formed from a lump of clay, which is itself prepared from the earth. In this case earth is the original ingredient forming the clay lump, and the clay lump is in a sense the original cause of the pot. When the pot is destroyed, it will again assume the designation clay and ultimately merge back into the earth, its original cause. In relation to the clay pot, clay is the beginning and final state; thus the pot is called real, for it possesses the essential characteristics of clay, which exists before and after the existence of the functioning instrument known as the pot. Similarly, earth exists before and after the clay, and thus clay may be considered real because it possesses the essential characteristics of earth, which exists before and after the existence of the clay. Similarly, earth and other elements are created from the mahat-tattva, which exists before and after the existence of the elements, which may be considered real because they possess the essential characteristics of the mahat-tattva. The mahat-tattva is ultimately the creation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, who exists after all is annihilated. The Absolute Truth is the Supreme Lord Himself, who step by step gives meaning and character to all that exists.</div>

<div class="Translation"> At the time of annihilation, the mortal body of the living being becomes merged into food. Food merges into the grains, and the grains merge back into the earth. The earth merges into its subtle sensation, fragrance. Fragrance merges into water, and water further merges into its own quality, taste. That taste merges into fire, which merges into form. Form merges into touch, and touch merges into ether. Ether finally merges into the sensation of sound. The senses all merge into their own origins, the presiding demigods, and they, O gentle Uddhava, merge into the controlling mind, which itself merges into false ego in the mode of goodness. Sound becomes one with false ego in the mode of ignorance, and all-powerful false ego, the first of all the physical elements, merges into the total nature. The total material nature, the primary repository of the three basic modes, dissolves into the modes. These modes of nature then merge into the unmanifest form of nature, and that unmanifest form merges into time. Time merges into the Supreme Lord, present in the form of the omniscient Mahä-puruña, the original activator of all living beings. That origin of all life merges into Me, the unborn Supreme Soul, who remains alone, established within Himself. It is from Him that all creation and annihilation are manifested.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The annihilation of the material world is the reversal of the process of creation, and ultimately everything is merged to rest within the Supreme Lord, who remains full in His absolute position.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Çré Kåñëa has explained that the material mind accepts and rejects many different concepts of life, generating innumerable false arguments about the actual process of perfection. But a person who takes shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can see everything with clear intelligence. One who understands how the Supreme Lord creates and annihilates can be liberated from material bondage and devote himself to the eternal service of the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Twenty-fourth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Philosophy of Säìkhya."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 25. The Three Modes of Nature and Beyond</div>
<div class="First"> To establish the transcendental nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this chapter describes the various functional manifestations of the three modes (goodness, passion and ignorance), which arise in the mind. Control of the mind, control of the senses, tolerance and so forth are manifestations of the unmixed mode of goodness. Desire, endeavor, false pride and so on are manifestations of the unmixed mode of passion. And anger, greed and bewilderment are among the functions of the unmixed mode of ignorance. In the admixture of the three modes we find the concept of "I" and "my," behavior in accordance with this mentality by body, mind and words, adherence to the principles of religiosity, economic development and sense gratification, and the fixed pursuit of one's occupational duty for material interest.</div>
<div class="First"> A person whose character is in the mode of goodness worships Lord Hari in a spirit of devotion, without regard to profit. On the other hand, one who hankers after the fruits of his worship of the Lord is passionate by nature. And one who desires violence is in the mode of ignorance. These modes of goodness, passion and ignorance are present in the infinitesimal living entity, whereas the Supreme Personality of Godhead is transcendental to the three modes of material nature.</div>
<div class="First"> The substance, place and result of activity, along with the time, the knowledge underlying action, the activity itself, the performer, his faith, his level of awareness, his spiritual progress and his destination after death, all partake of the three modes and manifest variously in terms of distinctions and hierarchies. But objects related to the Supreme Personality, places connected with Him, happiness based on Him, the time occupied in His worship, knowledge related to Him, work offered to Him, the performer of work who acts under His shelter, faith in His devotional service, progress toward the spiritual realm, and the destination of the Supreme Lord's personal abode all transcend the material modes.</div>
<div class="First"> There are many different destinations and conditions of life for the spirit soul within the cycle of material existence. These are all based on the modes of nature and on fruitive activities, which are governed by the modes. It is only by practicing the yoga of pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord that one can conquer the three modes, which arise originally from the mind. After obtaining a human body, which has the potential for developing knowledge and realization, a person who is intelligent should renounce association with the three modes of nature and then worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. First, by increasing the mode of goodness, one can defeat passion and ignorance. Then one can conquer material goodness by evolving his consciousness to the platform of transcendence. At that time he becomes entirely liberated from the material modes, gives up his subtle body (the material mind, intelligence and false ego) and attains the association of the Personality of Godhead. By the shattering of his subtle covering, the living entity is able to come face to face with the Supreme Lord and thus achieve absolute fulfillment by His grace.</div>

<div class="First"> The word asammiçra indicates that which is not mixed with anything else. Lord Kåñëa now explains how each of the three material modes (goodness, passion and ignorance), acting separately, causes a conditioned soul to manifest a particular type of existence. The living entity is ultimately transcendental to the modes of nature, being part and parcel of Lord Kåñëa, but in conditioned life he manifests material qualities.

<div class="Translation"> My dear Uddhava, the combination of all three modes is present in the mentality of "I" and "mine." The ordinary transactions of this world, which are carried out through the agency of the mind, the objects of perception, the senses and the vital airs of the physical body, are also based on the combination of the modes.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The illusory concept of "I" and "mine" occurs by the mixture of the three modes of nature. A person in goodness may feel, "I am peaceful." One in passion may think, "I am lusty." And one in ignorance may think, "I am angry." Similarly, one may think "my peace," "my lust" or "my anger." One completely absorbed in the mentality of being peaceful could not work in the material world; he would lack any impulse to perform activity. Similarly, one absorbed in lust would be blinded without at least a tinge of peacefulness or restraint. One overwhelmed with anger could not function properly in the material world without the mixture of other qualities. Thus we find that a material mode does not occur in a pure, isolated form but rather is mixed with other modes, thereby making possible normal functioning within this world. Ultimately one should think, "I am an eternal servant of Lord Kåñëa" and "My only possession is loving service to the Lord." This is the pure state of consciousness, beyond the material modes of nature.</div>

<div class="First"> Çüdras, persons in the mode of ignorance, are generally in deep illusion about the purpose of life, accepting the gross material body as the self. Those in passion and ignorance are called vaiçyas and hanker intensely for wealth, whereas kñatriyas, who are in the mode of passion, are eager for prestige and power. Those in the mode of goodness, however, hanker after perfect knowledge; they are therefore called brähmaëas. Such a person is promoted up to the supreme material position of Brahmaloka, the planet of Lord Brahmä. One who is in the mode of ignorance gradually falls to the level of unmoving species, such as trees and stones, while one in the mode of passion, filled with material desire but satisfying it within Vedic culture, is allowed to remain in human society.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Absolute knowledge is in the mode of goodness, knowledge based on duality is in the mode of passion, and foolish, materialistic knowledge is in the mode of ignorance. Knowledge based upon Me, however, is understood to be transcendental.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The Lord clearly explains here that spiritual knowledge of His supreme personality is transcendental to ordinary religious knowledge in the mode of goodness. In the mode of goodness one understands the existence of a higher spiritual nature within all things. In the mode of passion one acquires scientific knowledge of the material body. And in the mode of ignorance one fixes one's mind on the sense objects without higher awareness, perceiving things as a small child or a retarded person does.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Jéva Gosvämé elaborately explains in his commentary on this verse that the material mode of goodness does not award perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth. He quotes from Çrémad-Bhägavatam (6.14.2), proving that many great demigods in the mode of goodness could not understand the transcendental personality of Lord Kåñëa. In the material mode of goodness, one becomes pious or religious, aware of a higher, spiritual nature. On the spiritual platform of purified goodness, however, one establishes a direct, loving relationship with the Absolute Truth, rendering service to the Lord rather than merely maintaining a connection to mundane piety. In the mode of passion the conditioned soul speculates about the reality of his own existence and of the world around him, and considers speculatively the existence of a kingdom of God. In the mode of ignorance one acquires knowledge for sense gratification, absorbing the mind in varieties of eating, sleeping, defending and sex, without any higher purpose. Thus, within the modes of nature the conditioned souls are trying to gratify their senses, or else they are trying to free themselves from sense gratification. But they cannot directly engage themselves in their constitutional, liberated activities until they come to the transcendental position of Kåñëa consciousness, beyond the modes of nature.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Residence in the forest is in the mode of goodness, residence in a town is in the mode of passion, residence in a gambling house displays the quality of ignorance, and residence in a place where I reside is transcendental.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Many creatures in the forest, such as the trees, wild boars and insects, are actually in the modes of passion and ignorance. But residence in the forest is designated as being in the mode of goodness because there one may live a solitary life free from sinful activities, material opulence and passionate ambition. Throughout the history of India, many millions of persons from all walks of life have adopted the orders of vänaprastha and sannyäsa and have gone to sacred forests to practice austerity and perfect their self-realization. Even in America and other Western countries, persons such as Thoreau achieved fame by retiring to the forest to reduce the scope and opulence of material involvement.</div>
<div class="First"> The word gräma here indicates residence in the village of one's family. Family life is certainly full of false pride, false hopes, false affection, lamentation and illusion, since the family connection is squarely resting on the bodily concept of life, the very opposite of self-realization. The word dyüta-sadanam, "gambling house," refers to pool halls, racetracks, poker clubs, bars and other sinful places that maintain an abysmal level of consciousness in the mode of ignorance. Man-niketam refers to the Lord's own abode in the spiritual world as well as the Lord's temples within this world, wherein the Deity form of the Lord is appropriately worshiped. One who lives in the temple of Lord Kåñëa, following the rules and regulations of temple life, is understood to be residing on the transcendental platform. In these verses the Lord clearly explains that all material phenomena may be divided into three divisions according to the modes of nature, and that ultimately there is the fourth, or transcendental, division—Kåñëa consciousness—which elevates all aspects of human culture to the liberated platform.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The human form of life is a rare opportunity for achieving spiritual liberation in Kåñëa consciousness. Lord Kåñëa has elaborately described in this chapter the characteristics of the three modes of nature and the transcendental situation of Kåñëa consciousness. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu has ordered us to take shelter of the holy name of Lord Kåñëa, by which process we can easily transcend the modes of nature and begin our real life of loving devotional service to Lord Kåñëa.</div>
<div class="First"> Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Twenty-fifth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Three Modes of Nature and Beyond."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 26. The Aila-gétä</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter explains how unfavorable association is a threat to one's position in devotional service and how by associating with saintly persons one can attain the highest platform of devotion.</div>
<div class="First"> The jéva who has received a human body, which is in itself most conducive toward achieving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and who has situated himself in the duties of devotional service to the Lord becomes capable of realizing Him, the very identity of spiritual bliss. Such a person, fully dedicated to the Supreme Personality, is liberated from the influence of Mäyä; even while continuing to reside in this world created by illusion he is totally untouched by it. Those souls, on the other hand, who are bound up by Mäyä are devoted only to their bellies and genitals. They are impure, and by associating with them one will fall down into the dark pit of ignorance. The emperor Purüravä, who was bewildered by the association of the heavenly lady Urvaçé, later became renounced after being separated from her. He thus sang a song expressing his contempt for womanly connection. He described that persons who are attached to the body of a woman (or a man)-which is simply a mass of skin, meat, blood, sinew, brain tissue, marrow and bones-are not much different from worms. What is the worth of the education, austerity, renunciation, reception of the Vedas, solitary living and silence of one whose mind becomes stolen away by the body of a woman? Learned men should distrust their six mental enemies, headed by lust, and thus avoid associating with women or with men who are controlled by women. After declaring these facts, King Purüravä, now freed from the illusion of material existence, attained realization of the Supreme Lord in His form as the indwelling Supersoul.</div>
<div class="First"> In conclusion, one who is intelligent should give up bad association and let himself become attracted to the company of saintly persons. By their transcendental instructions, the saintly devotees of the Lord can break the false attachments of one's mind. Real saints are always liberated and devoted to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In their association there are constant discussions about the Supreme Lord, by serving whom the spirit soul completely eradicates his material sins and obtains pure devotional service. And when one gains the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the original ocean of unlimited perfect qualities, what else remains to be gained?</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Because of bad association, even those who are spiritually liberated may fall down from self-realization. Within the material world the association of women is especially dangerous, and therefore in this chapter the Aila-géta is spoken to prevent such a falldown. One can be saved from sex attraction by association with saintly persons, who awaken one's real spiritual intelligence. Therefore Lord Kåñëa will speak to Uddhava the amazing song of Purüravä, also known as the Aila-gétä.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> A person fixed in transcendental knowledge is freed from conditioned life by giving up his false identification with the products of the material modes of nature. Seeing these products as simply illusion, he avoids entanglement with the modes of nature, although constantly among them. Because the modes of nature and their products are simply not real, he does not accept them.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The three modes of nature become manifest as varieties of material bodies, places, families, countries, foods, sports, war, peace and so forth. In other words, everything we see within the material world is constituted of the modes of nature. A liberated soul, although existing within the ocean of material energy, sees everything as the property of the Lord and is thus not entangled. Although Mäyä tempts such a liberated soul to become a thief—to steal the property of the Lord for sense gratification—a Kåñëa conscious person does not bite the bait of Mäyä; he remains honest and pure in Kåñëa consciousness. In other words, he does not believe that anything within the universe can become his personal property for sense gratification, especially the illusory form of a woman.</div>

King Purüravä frankly admits here that the young lady Urvaçé is not to blame. After all, it was Purüravä who mistakenly considered her to be an object of his personal enjoyment, and therefore he suffered the reaction by the laws of nature. Purüravä himself was the offender for trying to exploit the external form of Urvaçé.</div>

<div class="Translation"> One can never decide whose property the body actually is. Does it belong to one's parents, who have given birth to it, to one's wife, who gives it pleasure, or to one's employer, who orders the body around? Is it the property of the funeral fire or of the dogs and jackals who may ultimately devour it? Is it the property of the indwelling soul, who partakes in its happiness and distress, or does the body belong to intimate friends who encourage and help it? Although a man never definitely ascertains the proprietor of the body, he becomes most attached to it. The material body is a polluted material form heading toward a lowly destination, yet when a man stares at the face of a woman he thinks, "What a good-looking lady! What a charming nose she's got, and see her beautiful smile!"</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The phrase tuccha-niñöhe, or "headed toward a lowly destination," indicates that if buried, the body will be consumed by worms; if burned, it will turn to ashes; and if dying in a lonely place, it will be consumed by dogs and vultures. The illusory potency of Mäyä enters within the female form and bewilders a man's mind. The man is attracted to Mäyä appearing within the female form, but when he embraces the woman's body he ends up with two handfuls of stool, blood, mucus, pus, skin, bone, hairs and flesh. People should not be like cats and dogs, in the ignorance of bodily consciousness. A human being should be enlightened in Kåñëa consciousness and learn to serve the Supreme Lord without falsely trying to exploit His potencies.</div>

<div class="Chapnum"> 27. Lord Kåñëa's Instructions on the Process of Deity</div>
<div class="First"> Worship</div>
<div class="First"> In this chapter the Supreme Personality of Godhead explains the process of kriyä-yoga, or Deity worship.</div>
<div class="First"> Worshiping the Deity form of the Supreme Lord automatically brings purity and satisfaction to the mind. Thus it is the source of all desirable gains. If a person has no engagement in Deity service he will simply remain attracted to material sense gratification, and he will have no hope of giving up bad association. The Personality of Godhead has given instruction, among the regulations of the Sätvata scriptures, on the process of worshiping Him as the bona fide Deity. Brahmä, Çiva, Närada, Vyäsa and all other sages have recommended this process described by the Lord as most perfectly beneficial for all the occupational classes and spiritual orders of human society, including even the women and çüdras.</div>
<div class="First"> There are three varieties of arcana, Deity worship, based on either the original Vedas, the secondary tantras, or a combination of these. The Deity image, the ground, the fire, the sun, the water and the heart of the worshiper are all true locations of the Deity's presence. The Deity form to be worshiped may be constructed of any one of eight substances-stone, wood, metal, clay, paint, sand (drawn upon the ground), the mind or jewels. These categories are further subdivided into two: temporary and permanent. The details of the worshiping process are as follows: The devotee should bathe both physically and by chanting mantras, and then he should perform the utterance of Gäyatré at the prescribed juncture of the day. He should arrange a seat facing either east or north, or else directly facing the Deity, and should bathe and clean the Deity. Then he should present clothing and ornaments, sprinkle water on the vessels and other paraphernalia to be used in the worship, and offer water for bathing the Deity's feet, arghya, water for washing His mouth, fragrant oils, incense, lamps, flowers and food preparations. After this, one should worship the Lord's personal servants and bodyguards, His consort energies, and the spiritual masters by chanting their respective müla-mantras. The worshiper should recite prayers from the Puräëas and other sources, offer obeisances flat on the ground, beg for benediction, and place on himself the remnants of the Lord's garlands. Included in this method of Deity worship are the proper installation of the transcendental Deity by constructing a fine temple, and also the conducting of processions and other festivals. By worshiping Lord Çré Hari with unconditional devotion in this manner, one gains access to pure loving service to His lotus feet. But if one steals property that has been given as charity to the Deity or the brähmaëas, whether given by himself or by others, he will have to take his next birth as a stool-eating worm.</div>

What are the qualifications of those devotees who worship the Deity, on what basis is such worship established, and what is the specific method of worship?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In addition to performing their prescribed duties, devotees of the Lord engage in regulated worship of the Lord in His Deity form in the temple. Such worship acts powerfully to cleanse the heart of both the lust to enjoy one's material body and the material family attachment that results directly from this lust. To be effective, however, the process of Deity worship must be performed in the authorized way. Therefore Uddhava now inquires from the Lord about this subject.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Here the word karma-käëòa refers to the various Vedic methods of worship, culminating in Deity worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Just as the means of sense gratification and material renunciation are innumerable, the transcendental pastimes and qualities the Supreme Personality of Godhead enjoys in His own abode, called Vaikuëöha, are also innumerable. The various concepts of piety and methods of purification in the material world ultimately cannot be reconciled amongst themselves without accepting the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, since without appreciation of Him there is no definitive understanding of what is actually obligatory for a human being. Even though almost all human beings are engaged in various processes of worship, the Lord will now summarize this topic, describing how one should worship Him in His Deity form.</div>

It should be remembered that superficial imitation of elaborate Vedic sacrifices will not bring one the actual perfection of life. One must perform sacrifice according to the prescription of the Supreme Lord, who recommends for this age the chanting of His holy names: Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare.</div>

Members of the brähmaëa, kñatriya and vaiçya communities all achieve dvijatvam, twice-born status, by initiation into the Gäyatré mantra. Traditionally, fully qualified brähmaëa boys may be initiated at age eight, kñatriyas at eleven and vaiçyas at twelve, provided the proper conditions are met. Having achieved twice-born status, one should faithfully worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form of the Deity, as the Lord Himself will describe.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains that certain Deity forms, such as those made of sand, are manifested for a brief time to fulfill a personal desire of the worshiper. Those, however, who desire to attain pure love of God should worship the permanent form of the Deity (made, for instance, of marble, gold or brass), and they should maintain continual worship. In Kåñëa consciousness there is no scope for neglecting the worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The devotees of the Lord understand themselves to be the Lord's eternal servitors; recognizing the Deity to be the Lord Himself, they permanently install the Deity and engage in perpetual worship. The impersonalists, however, regard the eternal form of the Lord as a temporary manifestation of illusion. In fact, they regard the Deity form as a mere stepping—stone in their ambitious program to become God. Materialistic persons of whatever stripe consider the Lord to be their order supplier, and so they make temporary arrangements for religious ceremonies to achieve temporary material sense gratification. This temporary mode of worship is favored by those desiring to exploit the Personality of Godhead for their personal ends, whereas the loving devotees in Kåñëa consciousness eternally engage in worship of the Personality of Godhead. They install permanent Deities meant to be worshiped perpetually.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> The Deity that is temporarily established can optionally be called forth and sent away, but these two rituals should always be performed when the Deity is traced upon the ground. Bathing should be done with water except if the Deity is made of clay, paint or wood, in which cases a thorough cleansing without water is enjoined.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Various classes of devotees worship the Deity of the Personality of Godhead according to their various stages of faith in the Lord. An advanced devotee of Lord Kåñëa understands his eternal loving relationship with the Lord and, seeing the Deity as the Lord Himself, establishes an eternal relationship with the Deity based on loving servitude to Him. Understanding Lord Kåñëa to be the eternal form of bliss and knowledge, a faithful devotee makes a permanent arrangement for Deity worship, installing the Lord's form made of, for example, stone, wood or marble.</div>
<div class="First"> The çälagräma-çilä is considered to be automatically installed even without the formal ceremony, and so it is forbidden to call the Deity with mantras or ask the Deity to leave. On the other hand, if one prepares a Deity form by drawing on sanctified ground or by constructing a sand image, one must call the Deity with mantras and then ask the Deity to leave the external form, which will soon be demolished by the natural elements. The general principle is that a pure devotee of the Lord understands his relationship with the Deity to be eternal. The more one surrenders in loving devotion to the Deity, the more one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Kåñëa is a person, but He is the Supreme Person, possessing His own unique feelings. One can easily please the Lord by devotional service offered to His Deity form. By pleasing the Lord one can gradually progress in the mission of human life and eventually go back home, back to Godhead, where the Deity personally appears before the devotee and welcomes the devotee to His personal abode, known throughout the world as the kingdom of God.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> A devotee still troubled by material desire tends to see the world as an object of sense gratification. Such a neophyte devotee may misunderstand the Lord's supreme position and may even consider the Lord an object of his own enjoyment. Hence the neophyte must offer opulent paraphernalia to the Deity so that he may constantly remember that the Deity is the supreme enjoyer and that he, the neophyte, is simply the worshiper and is actually meant for the Deity's pleasure. In contrast, an advanced devotee, one fixed in Kåñëa consciousness, never forgets that the Supreme Lord is the actual enjoyer and controller of everything. The pure devotee offers his unalloyed love to the Personality of Godhead along with whatever paraphernalia is easily obtained. A Kåñëa conscious devotee does not waver in his devotion to Lord Kåñëa, and even with the simplest offering he completely satisfies the Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation"> In worshiping the temple Deity, my dear Uddhava, bathing and decoration are the most pleasing offerings. For the Deity traced on sacred ground, the process of tattva-vinyäsa is most dear. Oblations of sesame and barley soaked in ghee are the preferred offering to the sacrificial fire, whereas worship consisting of upasthäna and arghya is preferred for the sun. One should worship Me in the form of water by offering water itself. Actually, whatever is offered to Me with faith by My devotee—even if only a little water—is most dear to Me.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The Supreme Personality of Godhead is present everywhere, and Vedic culture prescribes various ritualistic methods for worshiping the Lord in His various manifestations.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The Lord has stated in the previous verse that even a little water offered with love and devotion gives Him great pleasure. Therefore the words kià punaù indicate the Lord's complete happiness when a suitably opulent offering is made with love and devotion. But an opulent offering made by a nondevotee cannot please the Lord. As Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains, the rules and regulations concerning Deity worship and the listing of offenses against the Deities are all meant for helping one avoid precisely this kind of disrespectful or neglectful attitude toward the Personality of Godhead in His Deity form. In fact, all offenses against the Deity are based upon irreverence and disregard for the Lord's position as master, and thus upon disobedience to His orders. Since one must worship the Deity with reverence, one should offer opulent presentations to the Deity with love, for such presentations both enhance the respectfulness of the worshiper and help him avoid offenses in his worship.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the Gaëeça and Durgä mentioned in this verse are not the same personalities present within the material world; rather, they are eternal associates of the Lord in Vaikuëöha. In this world Gaëeça, the son of Lord Çiva, is famous for awarding financial success, and the goddess Durgä, the wife of Lord Çiva, is famous as the external, illusory potency of the Supreme Lord. The personalities mentioned here, however, are eternally liberated associates of the Lord who reside in the spiritual sky, beyond the material manifestation. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé quotes from various Vedic literatures to prove that the name Durgä may also indicate the internal potency of the Lord, who is nondifferent from Him. The external, or covering, potency of the Lord expands from this original Durgä. The Durgä of the material world, called Mahä-mäyä, assumes the function of bewildering the living entities. Thus a devotee should not fear becoming polluted by worshiping the Durgä mentioned here, who has the same name as illusion, but rather the devotee must show respect to these eternal servitors of the Supreme Lord in Vaikuëöha.</div>

<div class="First"> The Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped according to the faith of a particular worshiper. The Deity form, arcä, is specifically mentioned here because Deity worship is essential for spiritual progress. Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura mentions that inexperienced persons may think that the Deity is meant for the sense gratification of the worshiper, since superficially the Deity is made of external substances such as marble or brass. But through the process of installing the Deity by chanting of authorized mantras, one invites the Supreme Personality of Godhead to enter the Deity form. By regulated, faithful worship one gradually understands that the Deity is completely nondifferent from the Supreme Lord Himself. At that stage, on the strength of Deity worship, one rises to the second-class platform of devotional service. At this more developed stage one desires to make friendship with other devotees of the Lord, and as one becomes solidly established in the community of Vaiñëavas, one completely gives up material life and gradually becomes perfect in Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Twenty-seventh Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Lord Kåñëa's Instructions on the Process of Deity Worship."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 28. Jïäna-yoga</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter briefly summarizes the process of jïäna-yoga, which previous chapters described in detail.</div>
<div class="First"> Every created thing in this universe is a material product of the three modes of nature, is subject to sensory perception, and is essentially unreal. Actually, the designations of "good" and "bad" that we assign to the various objects and activities of this world are all superficial. It is better to avoid condemning or praising anything of this world, because doing so simply entangles one in matter and deprives one of the higher goals of spiritual life. Hidden within every object of the material universe is the spirit soul, who underlies both the causes and products of manifest existence. One should see things in this light and thus move about the material world in a mood of detachment.</div>
<div class="First"> As long as there is a relationship between the bodily senses, which are comprised of matter, and the soul, which is the reality, one will continue in false consciousness. Although material existence is unreal, those who lack discrimination remain entangled in the cycle of birth and death because of their absorption in sense gratification. All the phases of material life-such as birth, death, sorrow and happiness-belong not to the soul but to the materialistic false ego. By learning to distinguish between the soul and its opposite, matter, one can destroy this false identification. There is a single Absolute Truth present at the beginning and at the end of this world. During its interim, or maintenance, phase the cosmic manifestation is also founded upon the same Absolute Truth. This Absolute, Brahman, exists everywhere, both positively by its manifestations and negatively by its aloofness. Brahman is unique in being self-sufficient, whereas this world is the expansion of Brahman produced through the material mode of passion. By the mercy of a bona fide spiritual master, one can understand the Absolute Truth and come to appreciate the nonspiritual nature of the material body and its extensions. Desisting from engagement in material sense enjoyment, one then becomes satisfied in the ecstasy of the self. Just as the sun remains untouched by the coming and going of clouds, the discriminating, liberated person remains unaffected by the activities of his senses. Nevertheless, until one becomes perfectly fixed in bhakti-yoga, pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord, one should carefully avoid contacting material sense objects. An aspiring devotee may meet various obstacles and fall down, but in his next life he will continue his practice by dint of what he has already accomplished in devotional service. He will never again become bound up by the laws of karma. The man who is liberated and established in discrimination will under no circumstances seek false enjoyment by indulging in material sense gratification. He knows that the soul is changeless and that any contrary conception imposed on the pure self is sheer illusion. If, during the immature stage of spiritual practice, one suffers physical disease or other disturbances, the Vedas enjoin that he should certainly take proper measures to eradicate the problem. The prescribed remedies for lust and the other enemies of the mind are meditation on the Supreme Lord and saìkértana, the loud chanting of His names. The remedy for the disease of false ego is rendering service to the Supreme Lord's saintly devotees. By practicing yoga, some nondevotees keep their bodies youthful and fit, and may even achieve mystic perfections or long life. But these attainments are actually worthless, because they are perfections only of the material body. An intelligent person is therefore uninterested in this kind of process. Rather, by taking shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, an aspiring devotee who is seriously dedicated to the Lord rids himself of all disturbances and becomes empowered to attain the highest perfection, the full bliss of spiritual life.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Material situations and activities appear to be good, passionate or ignorant according to the interaction of the modes of nature. These modes are produced by the illusory potency of the Lord, which is itself not different from its master, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So a devotee of the Lord remains aloof from the illusory, temporary manifestations of material nature. At the same time, he accepts material nature as the potency of the Lord and thus essentially real. The example may be given that modeling clay is shaped by a child into various playful forms such as tigers, men or houses. The modeling clay is real, whereas the temporary shapes it assumes are illusory, not being actual tigers, men or houses. Similarly, the entire cosmic manifestation is modeling clay in the hands of the Supreme Lord, who acts through mäyä to shape the glaring temporary forms of illusion, which absorb the minds of those who are not devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Whoever indulges in praising or criticizing the qualities and behavior of others will quickly become deviated from his own best interest by his entanglement in illusory dualities.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> A conditioned soul desires to lord it over material nature and thus criticizes another conditioned soul whom he considers inferior. Similarly, one praises a superior materialist because one aspires to that superior position, in which one may dominate others. Praising and criticizing other materialistic people are thus directly or indirectly based on envy of other living entities and cause one to fall down from sva-artha, one's real self-interest, Kåñëa consciousness. The words asaty abhiniveçataù, "by absorption in the temporary, or unreal," indicate that one should not adopt a concept of material duality and praise or criticize other materialistic persons. Rather, one should praise the pure devotees of the Supreme Lord and criticize the mentality of rebellion against the Personality of Godhead, by which one becomes a nondevotee. One should not criticize a low-class materialist, thinking that a high-class materialist is nice. In other words, one should distinguish between the material and the spiritual and should not become absorbed in good and bad on the material platform. For example, an honest citizen distinguishes between the life of civil freedom and that of imprisonment, whereas a foolish prisoner distinguishes between comfortable and uncomfortable prison cells. Just as for a free citizen any situation in prison is unacceptable, for a liberated, Kåñëa conscious devotee any material position is unappealing.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura indicates that rather than trying to separate conditioned souls by materialistic distinctions, one should bring them together to chant the holy names of the Lord and propagate the saìkértana movement of Lord Caitanya. A nondevotee, or even an envious third-class devotee, is not interested in uniting people on the platform of love of Godhead. Instead he unnecessarily separates them by emphasizing material distinctions like "communist," "capitalist," "black," "white," "rich," "poor," "liberal," "conservative" and so on. Material life is always imperfect, full of ignorance and disappointing in the end. Rather than praising and criticizing the high and low features of ignorance, one should be absorbed in Kåñëa consciousness, on the spiritual platform of eternity, bliss and knowledge.</div>

<div class="First"> The material senses are described here as taijasa because they are born of false ego in the mode of passion. Impelled by false ego, one dreams of the material world without the Personality of Godhead and makes plans to lord it over nature, to exploit her resources. Modern atheistic scientists have developed this false ego to a fine art and imagine themselves great heroes conquering the obstacles of nature and moving forward toward inevitable omniscience. Such dreamy materialists are repeatedly stunned by the crushing reactions of the laws of nature, and their arrogant, agnostic civilizations are repeatedly annihilated by world wars, natural disasters and violent shifts of the cosmic situation.</div>
<div class="First"> On a simpler level, all conditioned souls are captivated by sex attraction and thus bound to the illusion of material society, friendship and love. They imagine themselves to be wonderful enjoyers of the material nature, which suddenly turns against them and kills them just like the "tamed" animal that suddenly turns on its master and kills him.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The actual truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, from whom everything emanates, by whom everything is maintained, and in whom everything merges to rest. Material nature is the reflection of the Absolute Truth, and by the interaction of the material modes of nature the innumerable varieties of matter appear to be separate, independent truths. Mäyä, illusion, distracts the conditioned soul from the Absolute Truth and absorbs his mind in the glaring manifestation of matter, which ultimately is nondifferent from the Absolute Truth, being an emanation from Him. The sense of good and bad as separate from the Supreme Lord is like the good and bad dreams experienced by a sleeping person. Good and bad dreams are equally unreal. Similarly, material good and evil have no permanent existence separate from the Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="First"> The Supreme Lord is the well-wisher of every living entity, and therefore execution of His order is good, whereas disobeying His order is bad. Lord Kåñëa has created a perfect social and occupational system called varëäçrama-dharma, and the Lord has further given perfect spiritual knowledge in Bhagavad-gétä and other literatures. Execution of Lord Kåñëa's order will bring complete social, psychological, political, economic and spiritual success to human society. We should not foolishly look for so-called good outside the orders of the Personality of Godhead. Such orders are called the laws of God and constitute the essence, or substance, of religion.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Although shadows, echoes and mirages are only illusory reflections of real things, such reflections do cause a semblance of meaningful or comprehensible perception. In the same way, although the identification of the conditioned soul with the material body, mind and ego is illusory, this identification generates fear within him even up to the moment of death.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Although shadows, echoes and mirages are mere reflections of real substances, they create strong emotions in persons falsely accepting them as real. In the same manner, a conditioned soul is seized by such emotions as fear, lust, anger and hope because of his illusory perception of himself as the material body, mind and false ego. By practical example it is thus shown that even illusory objects may cause highly emotional reactions. Ultimately our emotions should be absorbed in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is eternal truth. Fear is forever vanquished when one takes shelter of the Lord's lotus feet. One can then enjoy the pure emotions of liberated life.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The Supersoul alone is the ultimate controller and creator of this world, and thus He alone is also the created. Similarly, the Soul of all existence Himself both maintains and is maintained, withdraws and is withdrawn. No other entity can be properly ascertained as separate from Him, the Supreme Soul, who nonetheless is distinct from everything and everyone else. The appearance of the threefold material nature, which is perceived within Him, has no actual basis. Rather, you should understand that this material nature, composed of the three modes, is simply the product of His illusory potency.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The Absolute Truth, Lord Çré Kåñëa, expands His external potency and thus creates the material cosmos. As with the sun globe and its expanded rays, the Lord and His expanded potency are simultaneously one and different. Although to conditioned souls material duality seems to be based on the modes of nature, the entire material manifestation is actually nondifferent from the Lord and is of one ultimately spiritual nature. The modes of nature create sense objects, demigods, human beings, animals, friends, enemies and so forth. But in reality, everything is simply an expansion of the potency of the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> Foolishly, the conditioned soul tries to lord it over material nature, but the Lord Himself, being nondifferent from that nature, is its only true proprietor. In several places the Çrémad-Bhägavatam has given the example of the spider spinning its web by expanding thread from its own mouth. Similarly, through His own potency the Lord manifests the material world, maintains it and eventually withdraws it within Himself. Although the Lord is the unique Supreme Personality of Godhead, above everyone and everything, He is simultaneously and inconceivably nondifferent from everything. Therefore it is the Lord Himself who is manifested when the Lord creates, it is the Lord Himself who is maintained when the Lord maintains, and it is the Lord Himself who is withdrawn at the time of annihilation. Although the Lord is nondifferent from both His spiritual abode and His material creation, still the spiritual abode, Vaikuëöha, is always superior to the material manifestation. Both matter and spirit are energies of the Lord, yet the spiritual energy is molded into the eternal forms of bliss and knowledge, whereas the temporary forms of matter are symbols of ignorance and frustration for the conditioned souls who covet them. The Supreme Lord is Himself the reservoir of all pleasure and is thus dear to His devotees. The presumption that the Lord cannot give us complete pleasure is due to our misidentifying Him as a product of the material modes of nature. As a result, we pursue false happiness in the deadly embrace of mäyä and thus deviate from our eternal loving relationship with Lord Kåñëa.</div>

<div class="First"> According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, there are two main material dualities. The first duality is that one sees material good and bad, beautiful and ugly, rich and poor, and so on. The second is that one sees the entire material world as separate from or independent of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The first duality, that of opposites, is subject to dissolution by the influence of time, and the second duality, that of separateness, is merely a hallucination. One who is firmly convinced of the temporary, illusory nature of this world moves about freely, without attachment. Although engaging in all types of devotional service for the Lord, such a person is never entangled and remains cheerful and satisfied in spiritual consciousness.</div>

On the other hand, the material body, like firewood, is by nature dull and unilluminated. In itself it does not have any awareness of life.

Liberation is not an impersonal experience; liberation is attainment of one's eternal body, senses, mind and intelligence in the association of the Personality of Godhead. We can revive our eternal, liberated personality, free from the contamination of false ego, by dedicating ourselves to the loving service of the Lord in Kåñëa consciousness. When the pure spirit soul accepts the false ego, he must undergo material suffering. One automatically conquers the false ego by accepting oneself, in pure Kåñëa consciousness, to be the eternal servant of Lord Kåñëa.</div>

Thus we consider ourselves American, Russian, British, German, Indian, black, white, Hindu, Muslim, Christian and so forth. In fact, we are the marginal potency of the Supreme Lord, but by attempting to exploit the Lord's inferior material potency we have become entangled in illusion.

<div class="First"> The total material nature, pradhäna, is originally undifferentiated and inert, but later it undergoes transformation when the Supreme Lord, through His time agent, glances upon it and activates the mode of passion. Material transformation thus takes place and is exhibited as the Lord's inferior energy. In contrast, the Supreme Lord's personal abode possesses eternal variety, which is the self-luminous, internal opulence of the Absolute Truth and is not subject to material creation, transformation or annihilation.

<div class="First"> The word tathäpi in this verse indicates that even though the material nature is nondifferent from the Supreme Lord (as elaborately described in this chapter), one who has yet to conquer material desire should not artificially associate with material things, declaring them to be nondifferent from the Lord. Thus one aspiring to be Kåñëa conscious should not loosely associate with women, claiming them to be nondifferent from the Personality of Godhead, for by such imitation of the most advanced devotees one will become a sense gratifier. A neophyte devotee who presumes himself liberated is impelled by the mode of passion to become falsely proud of his position, and thus he neglects the actual process of devotional service to the Lord. One must have firm and steady engagement in the loving service of the Lord, under the direction of higher authorities; then advancement in Kåñëa consciousness will be easy and sublime.</div>

The words na tu karma-tantram indicate that a fallen transcendentalist does not have to pass through the lower stages of fruitive activity and gradually be promoted to the practice of yoga. Rather, he will immediately resume his yoga practice at that point at which he left it. Of course, one should not presume to fall back on the facility offered here but should try to become perfect in this lifetime. Sannyäsés, especially, should remove the knot of lust from their hearts and should avoid falling into the clutches of flattering followers or female disciples sent by the demigods to expose a so-called spiritual leader who is imperfect in Kåñëa conscious knowledge.</div>

But a learned person, one who is in touch with the Supreme Lord within his heart, realizes the ultimate frustration of material work and the danger of entering the womb of a pig or dog in a future life as the result of sinful activities. One on the platform of self-realization does not regard himself as an enjoyer of the world.

Thus the living entity can neither assume nor reject the soul, which is an eternal fact.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> As explained in verse 33 of this chapter, the eternal self is neither assumed nor lost, since every living entity is an eternal reality. The word vikalpa, or "duality," here refers to the mistaken idea that the spirit soul is partly composed of matter in the form of the gross body or subtle mind. It is thus that foolish persons consider the material body or mind to be an intrinsic or fundamental component of the self. In fact the living entity is pure spirit, without any tinge of matter. Consequently the false ego, which is generated by the false identification with matter, is a mistaken identity imposed upon the pure spirit soul. The sense of ego, or "I am" in other words, the sense of one's individual identity—comes from the spirit soul, because there is no other possible basis for such self-awareness. By studying one's false sense of ego, one can analytically understand that there is a pure ego, which is expressed by the words ahaà brahmäsmi(97), "I am pure spirit soul." One can easily understand in a similar way that there is a supreme spirit soul, the Personality of Godhead, who is the omniscient controller of everything. Such understanding in Kåñëa consciousness constitutes perfect knowledge, as described here by the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The duality of the five material elements is perceived only in terms of names and forms. Those who say this duality is real are pseudoscholars vainly proposing fanciful theories without basis in fact.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Material names and forms, subject as they are to creation and annihilation, have no permanent existence and so do not constitute essential, fundamental principles of reality. The material world consists of variegated transformations of the potency of God. Although God is real and His potency is real, the particular forms and names that temporarily or circumstantially appear have no ultimate reality. Gross ignorance occurs when the conditioned soul imagines himself to be material or a mixture of matter and spirit. Some philosophers argue that the eternal soul in contact with matter is permanently transformed and that the false ego represents a new and permanent reality of the soul. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé replies that spirit is the living, superior energy of the Lord, whereas matter is the inferior, unconscious energy of the Lord, and that these two energies thus possess opposite qualities, as with light and darkness. The superior living entity and inferior matter therefore cannot possibly merge into a common existence, since they eternally possess opposite and incompatible characteristics. The hallucination of a mixture of matter and spirit is called illusion; it becomes specifically manifest as false ego, which identifies with a specific material body or mind created by illusion. Clearly those scientists or philosophers who are embedded in gross ignorance cannot be real scientists and philosophers. The simple criterion of spiritual self-awareness unfortunately eliminates a huge percentage of modern so-called scientists and philosophers, who bury their foolish noses in the Lord's material energy, without any knowledge of or interest in the Lord Himself.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, the Supreme Lord has briefly described to Uddhava the essential wisdom of all the Upaniñads, with the conclusion that pure devotional service to the Lord is the real means of ultimate liberation. In this regard Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura emphasizes that although haöha-yogés and räja-yogés try to make progress along their prescribed paths, they confront obstacles and often fail to achieve their desired goals. However, one who surrenders to the Supreme Lord will certainly be victorious on his spiritual path back home, back to Godhead. Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Twenty-eighth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Jïäna-yoga."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 29. Bhakti-yoga</div>
<div class="First"> Thinking that the previously described spiritual practice, based on detachment, is too difficult, Uddhava inquired about an easier method. In reply, Lord Çré Kåñëa gave brief instructions on devotional service. The fruitive workers and mystic yogés, who are bewildered by the illusory energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and puffed up by their false identifications, refuse to take shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord. But the swanlike men, those who know how to discriminate between the essential and nonessential, always take shelter at the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Lord Himself-within the living entity as the caittya-guru and without as the spiritual master who teaches by example-eradicates all the misfortune of the spirit soul and reveals His own personal form.</div>
<div class="First"> One should execute all duties for the sake of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, keeping one's mind absorbed in Him. One should take advantage of the sacred abodes of the Lord, where His devotees reside, and one should serve the Lord and celebrate the festivals and holidays in His honor. By understanding all living beings to be Lord Kåñëa's place of residence, one can attain the ability to see equally everywhere, and thus all faulty qualities of envy, false ego and so on will be removed. Bearing this in mind, the devotee should give up his proud relatives, his separatist outlook and his mundane embarrassment and should offer obeisances flat on the ground to all, even the dogs and outcastes. As long as one has not learned to see the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in all creatures, he must continue to use his body, mind and speech to worship the Supreme Lord in that manner of offering full obeisances to all.</div>
<div class="First"> Because this eternal process of devotional service to the Supreme Lord is transcendental and has been established by the Lord Himself, it can never, to the slightest extent, be defeated or prove fruitless. When one offers himself completely to the Supreme Lord with exclusive devotion, the Lord becomes particularly pleased, and thus the devotee achieves immortality, becoming qualified to obtain opulence equal to that of the Lord. After receiving these instructions, Çré Uddhava went to Badarikäçrama in pursuance of Lord Kåñëa's order, and by perfectly carrying out the instructions of the Supreme Lord, he attained the Lord's transcendental abode. By faithfully serving these instructions spoken by the Personality of Godhead to Uddhava, the greatest of devotees, the entire world can become liberated.</div>

The word yoga-karmabhiù indicates that those who are attracted to or proud of achievements in the field of mystic yoga or ordinary material endeavor cannot appreciate the great advantage of obediently surrendering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Generally the yogés and fruitive workers are proud of their so-called achievements and are more attracted to their own endeavor than to the Lord Himself. By humbly taking shelter of Lord Kåñëa, one can advance easily and quickly on the path of Kåñëa consciousness and go back home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The devotees of the Lord become completely successful by the Lord's causeless mercy. Sometimes Lord Kåñëa accepts a position of subservience to His great devotees, as with Nanda Mahäräja, the gopés, Bali Mahäräja and others. Although demigods like Lord Brahmä were standing in line to touch their helmets to the Lord's foot cushion, still Lord Rämacandra awarded His most intimate friendship to subhumans, such as the monkeys headed by Hanumän. Similarly Lord Kåñëa's affection for the deer and cows, and even for the trees of Våndävana, is well known. Further, the Lord gladly drove the chariot of Arjuna and acted as the messenger and faithful subordinate of King Yudhiñöhira. Such devotees have no need for the elaborate jïäna-yoga systems or the process for achieving mystic powers. All these devotees are represented here by Çré Uddhava, who frankly informs the Lord that the sophisticated systems of philosophical speculation and mystic yoga are not appealing for one who has developed a taste for direct loving service to the Lord.</div>

<div class="First"> The words mad-dharmätma-mano-ratiù mean that all of one's love and affection should be devoted to pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is not indicated here that one should try to relish selfish satisfaction in devotional service, but rather that one should be attracted to the Lord's own satisfaction, which one achieves by faithfully executing the order of a bona fide spiritual master coming in disciplic succession from Lord Kåñëa Himself. Attachment to one's own satisfaction, even within devotional service, is materialistic, whereas attachment to the satisfaction of the Lord is pure spiritual emotion.</div>

<div class="Translation"> O brilliant Uddhava, one who thus views all living entities with the idea that I am present within each of them, and who by taking shelter of this divine knowledge offers due respect to everyone, is considered actually wise. Such a man sees equally the brähmaëa and the outcaste, the thief and the charitable promoter of brahminical culture, the sun and the tiny sparks of fire, the gentle and the cruel.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> A series of opposites is set forth here—namely the high-class brähmaëa and the low-class aborigine, the thief who steals from respectable persons and the respecter of brahminical culture who gives charity to brähmaëas, the all-powerful sun and the insignificant spark, and finally the kind and the cruel. Ordinarily, the ability to distinguish between such opposites qualifies one as intelligent. How, then, can the Lord state that ignoring such obvious differences establishes one as a wise man? The answer is given by the words mad-bhävena: a wise person sees the Supreme Personality of Godhead within everything. Therefore, although externally perceiving and dealing with the varieties of material situations, a wise man is more impressed by and concerned with the overwhelming unity of all existence, which is based on the presence of the Supreme Lord within everything. As explained here, a truly wise person is not limited to superficial material discrimination.</div>

Similarly, one who is anxious to become a sophisticated transcendental philosopher is not the most intelligent. Nor is one who is expert in accumulating money. The Lord here states that the most intelligent and clever person is the devotee who offers his temporary, illusory material body and possessions to Him with love and without personal motivation. The devotee thus obtains the eternal Absolute Truth. In other words, real intelligence is to actually surrender to Lord Kåñëa, without personal desire or duplicity. That is the Lord's opinion.</div>

<div class="First"> Çré Uddhava had been bewildered by considering manifestations of Lord Kåñëa's own potency to be separate from Him. Uddhava's lamentation arose because he thought himself separated from Lord Kåñëa. Actually, Çré Uddhava is an eternally liberated soul, but the Lord placed him in bewilderment and lamentation so that this supreme knowledge of the Uddhava-géta could be spoken. Lord Kåñëa's question here indicates that if Uddhava had not perfectly understood this knowledge, Lord Kåñëa would have explained the same thing again. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, since Çré Uddhava is the intimate friend of Lord Kåñëa, the Lord's question here was in a friendly, playful spirit. The Lord was well aware of Uddhava's complete enlightenment in Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="First"> This chapter discusses the destruction of the Yadu dynasty in connection with the winding up of the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

They followed His advice and went to Prabhäsa. There they became absorbed in festivity, and by the illusory power of Lord Kåñëa they became intoxicated from drinking liquor. Thus losing their intelligence, they quarreled among themselves and began killing one another, until not a man was left alive.</div>
<div class="First"> Afterward, Çré Baladeva went to the shore of the ocean and by the mystic strength of yoga gave up His body. Seeing the disappearance of Baladeva, Lord Çré Kåñëa sat down silently upon the ground. Then a hunter named Jarä, mistaking the sole of the Lord's left foot for a deer, pierced it with an arrow. The hunter immediately understood his mistake and, falling at the feet of Lord Çré Kåñëa, begged to be punished. In reply Lord Kåñëa told the hunter that what he had done was actually according to His own desire. The Lord then sent the hunter to Vaikuëöha.</div>
<div class="First"> When Däruka, Kåñëa's charioteer, arrived on the scene and saw Lord Kåñëa in that condition, he began to lament. Kåñëa told him that he should go to Dvärakä, inform the residents about the annihilation of the Yadu dynasty, and advise them all to leave Dvärakä for Indraprastha. Däruka obediently carried out this order.</div>

<div class="First"> Parékñit Mahäräja now inquires from Çukadeva Gosvämé about the topic of Chapter One of this canto, namely the annihilation of the Yadu dynasty and Lord Kåñëa's return to the spiritual sky. Because Lord Kåñëa was playing the part of an ordinary member of the Yadu dynasty, He appeared to react to the curse of the brähmaëas by giving up His earthly pastimes. Lord Kåñëa cannot actually be cursed by anyone. Närada Muni and the other sages who cursed the Yadu dynasty are eternal devotees of Lord Kåñëa and could hardly curse Him. Therefore, in giving up His pastimes and leaving the earth with the Yadu dynasty, Lord Kåñëa demonstrated His internal potency and personal will, since no one can challenge the supreme potency of the Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Once their eyes were fixed upon His transcendental form, women were unable to withdraw them, and once that form had entered the ears of the sages and become fixed in their hearts, it would never depart. What to speak of acquiring fame, the great poets who described the beauty of the Lord's form would have their words invested with transcendentally pleasing attraction. And by seeing that form on Arjuna's chariot, all the warriors on the battlefield of Kurukñetra attained the liberation of gaining a spiritual body similar to the Lord's.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Transcendental, liberated personalities such as the gopés of Våndävana and Rukmiëé, the original goddess of fortune, were constantly meditating on the Lord's spiritual body. Great liberated sages (satäm), having heard about Lord Kåñëa's body, could not take it out of their hearts. The Lord's bodily beauty expanded the love and poetic output of great liberated poets, and simply by seeing Lord Kåñëa's body, the warriors at Kurukñetra achieved spiritual liberation with an eternal body similar to the Lord's. Therefore it is impossible to imagine Lord Kåñëa's eternal form of bliss to be in any way material. Those who imagine that Lord Kåñëa gave up His eternal form are certainly bewildered by the Lord's illusory energy.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: O leaders of the Yadu dynasty, please note all these terrible omens that have appeared in Dvärakä just like the flags of death. We should not remain here a moment longer.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has given a great amount of evidence from the Vedic literatures proving that the humanlike form of the Personality of Godhead and His holy name, abode, paraphernalia and associates are all eternal, spiritual manifestations without any tinge of material contamination. (See Appendix). In this regard the äcärya has further explained that because the living entities must suffer the reactions to their sinful activities, the Lord arranges for them to be punished during the Kali-yuga. In other words, it is not Lord Kåñëa's desire that conditioned souls be sinful and suffer, but since they are already sinful, the Lord creates an appropriate age during which they can experience the bitter fruits of irreligiosity.</div>
<div class="First"> Since Lord Kåñëa personally establishes religious principles in His various appearances in this material world, at the end of Dväpara-yuga religion on the earth was overwhelmingly powerful. All the significant demons had been killed; the great sages, saints and devotees had been greatly encouraged, enlightened and fortified; and there was little scope for irreligion. Had Lord Kåñëa ascended to the spiritual sky in His spiritual body before the eyes of the world, it would have been very difficult for Kali-yuga to flourish. Lord Kåñëa left the world in exactly that way during His appearance as Rämacandra, and hundreds of thousands of years later, hundreds of millions of pious persons still discuss this wonderful pastime of the Lord. To pave the way for Kali-yuga, however, Lord Kåñëa left this world in a way that puzzles those who are not His staunch devotees.</div>
<div class="First"> The eternal form of the Lord is described throughout Vedic literature, and His eternal form constitutes the highest understanding of the Absolute Truth according to all great äcäryas, including Çaìkaräcärya and Caitanya Mahäprabhu. Yet although Lord Kåñëa's eternal, spiritual form is a realized fact for advanced devotees, for those who are weak in Kåñëa consciousness the inconceivable pastimes and plan of the Lord are sometimes hard to appreciate properly.</div>

A beautiful smile graced His lotus face, locks of dark blue hair adorned His head, His lotus eyes were very attractive, and His shark-shaped earrings glittered. He wore a pair of silken garments, an ornamental belt, the sacred thread, bracelets and arm ornaments, along with a helmet, the Kaustubha jewel, necklaces, anklets and other royal emblems.

<div class="First"> According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the statement that the arrow "pierced the Lord's foot" expresses the point of view of the hunter, who thought he had struck a deer. In fact the arrow merely touched the Lord's lotus foot and did not pierce it, since the Lord's limbs are composed of eternity, knowledge and bliss. Otherwise, in the description of the next verse (that the hunter became fearful and fell down with his head upon the Lord's feet), Çukadeva Gosvämé would have stated that he extracted his arrow from the Lord's foot.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains that the fratricidal battle of the Yadu dynasty and the hunter's attack upon Lord Kåñëa are clearly activities of the Lord's internal potency for the purpose of fulfilling the Lord's pastime desires. According to the evidence, the quarrel among the members of the Yadu dynasty occurred at sunset; then the Lord sat down on the bank of the Sarasvaté River. It is stated that a hunter then arrived with the intention of killing a deer, but it is highly unlikely—when more than 560 million warriors had just been killed in a great uproarious battle and the place had been flooded with blood and strewn with corpses—that a simple hunter would somehow come along trying to kill a deer. Since deer are by nature fearful and timid, how could any deer possibly be on the scene of such a huge battle, and how could a hunter calmly go about his business in the midst of such carnage? Therefore, the withdrawal of the Yadu dynasty and Lord Kåñëa's own disappearance from this earth were not material historical events; they were instead a display of the Lord's internal potency for the purpose of winding up His manifest pastimes on earth.</div>

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Eleventh Canto, Thirtieth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Disappearance of the Yadu Dynasty."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 31. The Disappearance of Lord Çré Kåñëa</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter describes the return of the Supreme Personality of Godhead to His own abode, along with all the Yadus.</div>
<div class="First"> Upon learning from Däruka that Lord Çré Kåñëa had returned to His abode, Vasudeva and all the others remaining in Dvärakä became very much agitated by lamentation and went out from the city to find Him. All the demigods who, in pursuance of the desire of Lord Kåñëa, had taken birth in the Yadu dynasty to render assistance in His pastimes followed Lord Kåñëa and returned to their respective abodes. The Lord's activities of creating a life for Himself and then dismantling it are simply tricks of Mäyä, like an actor's performance. Actually, He creates the entire universe, and then He enters within it as the Supersoul. In the end, He again winds up the entire universe within Himself and, remaining in His private glory, desists from external pastimes. Though overcome by feelings of separation from Kåñëa, Arjuna was nevertheless able to pacify himself by remembering all the various instructions given to him by the Lord. Arjuna then carried out the rituals of offering piëòa and so on for his dead relatives. At that time the ocean swallowed up all of Dvärakä-puré except for the Lord's own residence. Arjuna took the remaining members of the Yadu dynasty to Indraprastha, where he installed Vajra upon the throne. Hearing of these events, the Päëòavas, led by Yudhiñöhira, placed Parékñit upon their throne and left for the great journey.</div>

<div class="First"> According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, Lord Kåñëa had previously answered the prayers of Lord Brahmä and the other demigods, who had requested the Lord to descend within this universe for the protection of His servants, the demigods. Now the demigods arrived before the Lord, each one desiring to take the Lord to his own planet. To avoid these innumerable social obligations, the Lord closed His eyes as if absorbed in samädhi.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Jéva Gosvämé adds that Lord Kåñëa closed His eyes to instruct the yogés how to leave this mortal world without attachment to one's mystic opulences. All the demigods, including Brahmä, are mystic expansions of Lord Kåñëa, and yet the Lord closed His eyes to emphasize that one should fix one's mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead when departing from this world.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Without employing the mystic ägneyé meditation to burn up His transcendental body, which is the all-attractive resting place of all the worlds and the object of all contemplation and meditation, Lord Kåñëa entered into His own abode.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> A yogé empowered to select the moment of leaving his body can cause it to burst into flames by engaging in the yogic meditation called ägneyé, and thus he passes into his next life. The demigods similarly employ this mystic fire when being transferred to the spiritual world. But the Supreme Personality of Godhead is completely different from conditioned souls like yogés and demigods, since the Lord's eternal, spiritual body is the source of all existence, as indicated here by the words lokäbhirämäà sva-tanum. Lord Kåñëa's body is the source of pleasure for the entire universe. The word dhäraëä-dhyäna-maìgalam indicates that those trying for spiritual elevation through meditation and yoga achieve all auspiciousness through meditation on the Lord's body. Since yogés are liberated simply by thinking of Lord Kåñëa's body, that body is certainly not material and therefore not subject to burning by mundane mystic fire or any other type of fire.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura reminds us of Lord Kåñëa's statement in the Eleventh Canto, Chapter Fourteen, verse 37: vahni-madhye smared rüpaà mamaitad dhyäna-maìgalam. "Within the fire one should meditate upon My form, which is the auspicious object of all meditation." Since Lord Kåñëa's transcendental form is present within fire as the maintaining principle, how can fire affect that form? Thus although the Lord appeared to enter the mystic yoga trance, the word adagdhvä indicates that the Lord, since His body is purely spiritual, bypassed the formality of burning and directly entered His own abode in the spiritual sky. This point has also been elaborately explained by Çréla Jéva Gosvämé in his commentary to this verse.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear King, you should understand that the Supreme Lord's appearance and disappearance, which resemble those of embodied conditioned souls, are actually a show enacted by His illusory energy, just like the performance of an actor. After creating this universe He enters into it, plays within it for some time, and at last winds it up. Then the Lord remains situated in His own transcendental glory, having ceased from the functions of cosmic manifestation.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, the so-called fight among the members of the Yadu dynasty was actually a display of the pastime potency of the Lord, since Lord Kåñëa's personal associates are never subject to ordinary birth and death like conditioned souls. This being the case, certainly the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself is transcendental to material birth and death, as clearly stated in this verse.</div>
<div class="First"> The word naöasya, "of an actor or magician," is significant here. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura tells the following story of a certain magician who exhibits the trick of dying:</div>
<div class="First"> "In front of a great king, a magician approaches a stack of valuable garments, jewels, coins and so forth, all placed there by the king. Taking a jeweled necklace, the magician tells the king, 'Now I am taking this necklace, and you can't have it,' and he makes the necklace disappear. 'Now I'm taking this gold coin, and you can't have it,' he says, and makes the gold coin disappear. Next, challenging the king in the same way, the magician makes seven thousand horses disappear. Then the magician creates the illusion that the king's children, grandchildren, brothers and other family members have attacked each other and that nearly all are dead from the violent quarrel. The king hears the magician speaking and at the same time observes these things taking place before him as he sits in the great assembly hall. "Then the magician says, 'O King, I no longer wish to live. Just as I have studied magic, so also, by the mercy of the lotus feet of my guru, I have learned the mystic meditation of yoga. One is supposed to give up one's body while meditating in a holy place, and since you have performed so many pious activities, you are a holy place yourself. Therefore I shall now give up my body.' "Thus speaking, the magician sits down in the proper yoga posture, fixes himself in präëäyäma, pratyähära, dhäraëä, dhyäna and samädhi and becomes silent. A moment later, a fire generated from his trance blazes forth out of his body and burns it to ashes. Then all the wives of the magician, distraught with lamentation, enter into that fire.</div>
<div class="First"> "Three or four days later, after the magician has returned to his own province, he sends one of his daughters to the king. The daughter tells him, 'O King, I have just come to your palace, bringing along with me, invisibly, all your sons, grandsons and brothers in good health—along with all the jewels and other items given by you. Please, therefore, give me whatever you consider fitting remuneration for the wisdom of the magic that has been exhibited before you.' In this way, even by ordinary magic one can simulate birth and death."</div>
<div class="First"> It is not difficult to understand, therefore, that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although transcendental to the laws of nature, exhibits His illusory potency so that ordinary fools will think the Lord has left His body like a human being. Actually, Lord Kåñëa returned to His abode in His own eternal body, as confirmed throughout the Vedic literature.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Lord Kåñëa brought the son of His guru back from the planet of the lord of death in the boy's selfsame body, and as the ultimate giver of protection He saved you also when you were burned by the brahmästra of Açvatthämä. He conquered in battle even Lord Çiva, who deals death to the agents of death, and He sent the hunter Jarä directly to Vaikuëöha in his human body. How could such a personality be unable to protect His own Self?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> To mitigate his own and Parékñit Mahäräja's distress at the narration of Lord Kåñëa's departure from this world, Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé here gives several clear examples proving that Lord Kåñëa is far beyond the influence of death. Although the son of Lord Kåñëa's spiritual master (Sändépani Muni) had been taken by death, the Lord brought him back in his same body. Similarly, the power of Brahman cannot touch Lord Kåñëa, since Parékñit Mahäräja, though burned by the brahmästra weapon, was easily saved by the Lord. Lord Çiva was clearly defeated by Lord Kåñëa in the battle with Bäëäsura, and the hunter Jarä was sent to a Vaikuëöha planet in his same human body. Death is an insignificant expansion of Lord Kåñëa's external potency and cannot possibly act upon the Lord Himself. Those who actually understand the transcendental nature of Lord Kåñëa's activities will find convincing evidence in these examples.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Although Lord Kåñëa, being the possessor of infinite powers, is the only cause of the creation, maintenance and destruction of innumerable living beings, He simply did not desire to keep His body in this world any longer. Thus He revealed the destination of those fixed in the self and demonstrated that this mortal world is of no intrinsic value.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Although Lord Kåñëa descended to this world to save the fallen souls, He did not want to encourage people in the future to loiter here unnecessarily. In other words, as soon as possible one should perfect one's Kåñëa consciousness and go back home, back to Godhead. If Lord Kåñëa had remained longer on the earth, He would have unnecessarily increased the prestige of the material world.</div>
<div class="First"> As stated by Çré Uddhava in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (3.2.11), ädäyäntar adhäd yas tu sva-bimbaà loka-locanam: "Lord Çré Kåñëa, who manifested His eternal form before the vision of all on the earth, performed His disappearance by removing His form from the sight of those who are unable to see Him [as He is] due to not executing the required penance. " Uddhava also states in the Bhägavatam (3.2.10):</div>

Dvärakä had been constructed by Viçvakarmä, the architect of the demigods, and the Sudharmä assembly hall had been brought from heaven. In that city there were many beautiful and splendorous residences of the aristocratic Yadu dynasty, and the most beautiful residence of all was that of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Çréla Jéva Gosvämé mentions that even in the modern age, people who live near the site of the original Dvärakä sometimes catch a glimpse of it in the ocean. Ultimately, the Lord's associates and abode are eternal, and one who understands this is qualified to become fully Kåñëa conscious.</div>
