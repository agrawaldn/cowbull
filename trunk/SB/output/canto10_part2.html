<div class="Chapnum"> 14. Brahmä's Prayers to Lord Kåñëa</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter describes the prayers Brahmä offered to Lord Kåñëa, who is also known as Nanda-nandana.</div>
<div class="First"> For His satisfaction, Brahmä first praised the beauty of the Lord's transcendental limbs and then declared that His original identity of sweetness is even more difficult to comprehend than His opulence. Only by the devotional process of hearing and chanting transcendental sounds received from Vedic authorities can one realize the Personality of Godhead. It is fruitless to try to realize God through processes outside the scope of Vedic authority.</div>
<div class="First"> The mystery of the Personality of Godhead, who is the reservoir of unlimited spiritual qualities, is inconceivable; it is even more difficult to understand than the impersonal Supreme. Thus only by the mercy of God can one understand His glories. Finally realizing this, Brahmä repeatedly condemned his own actions and recognized that Lord Çré Kåñëa, the ultimate shelter of the universe, is Brahmä's own father, the original Näräyaëa. In this way Brahmä begged the Lord's forgiveness.</div>
<div class="First"> Brahmä then glorified the inconceivable opulence of the Personality of Godhead and described the ways in which Brahmä and Çiva differ from Lord Viñëu, the reason for the Supreme Lord's appearance in various species of demigods, animals and so on, the eternal nature of the pastimes of the Personality of Godhead, and the temporality of the material world. By knowing the Supreme Personality in truth, the individual spirit soul can achieve liberation from bondage. In actuality, however, both liberation and bondage are unreal, for it is only from the living entity's conditioned outlook that his bondage and liberation are produced. Thinking the personal form of Lord Kåñëa illusory, fools reject His lotus feet and look elsewhere to find the Supreme Self. But the futility of their search is the obvious proof of their foolishness. There is simply no way to understand the truth of the Personality of Godhead without His mercy.</div>
<div class="First"> Having established this conclusion, Lord Brahmä analyzed the great good fortune of the residents of Vraja and then personally prayed to be born there even as a blade of grass, a bush or a creeper. Indeed, the homes of the residents of Våndävana are not prisons of material existence but rather abodes envied even by the jïänés and yogés. On the other hand, any home without a connection to Lord Kåñëa is in fact a prison cell of material existence. Finally, Brahmä offered his whole self at the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord and, praising Him again and again, circumambulated Him and took his leave. Lord Kåñëa then gathered the animals Brahmä stole and led them to the place on the Yamunä's bank where the cowherd boys had been taking lunch. The same friends who had been present before were sitting there now. By the power of Kåñëa's illusory energy, they were not at all aware of what had happened. Thus when Kåñëa arrived with the calves, the boys told Him, "You've returned so quickly! Very good. As long as You were gone we couldn't take even a morsel of food, so come and eat."</div>
<div class="First"> Laughing at the words of the cowherd boys, Lord Kåñëa began taking His meal in their company. While eating, Kåñëa pointed out to His young friends the skin of the python, and the boys thought, "Kåñëa has just now killed this terrible snake." Indeed, later they related to the residents of Våndävana the incident of Kåñëa's killing the Agha demon. In this way, the cowherd boys described pastimes that Lord Kåñëa had performed in His bälya age (one to five), even though His paugaëòa age (six to ten) had begun. Çukadeva Gosvämé concludes this chapter by explaining how the gopés loved Lord Kåñëa even more than they loved their own sons.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Lord Brahmä said: My dear Lord, You are the only worshipable Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore I offer my humble obeisances and prayers just to please You. O son of the king of the cowherds, Your transcendental body is dark blue like a new cloud, Your garment is brilliant like lightning, and the beauty of Your face is enhanced by Your guïjä earrings and the peacock feather on Your head. Wearing garlands of various forest flowers and leaves, and equipped with a herding stick, a buffalo horn and a flute, You stand beautifully with a morsel of food in Your hand.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In the previous chapter Brahmä, the creator of the universe, tried to bewilder the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa, by stealing His cowherd boyfriends and calves. But by a slight exhibition of Kåñëa's own mystic potency, Brahmä himself was completely bewildered, and now with great humility and devotion he offers his humble obeisances and prayers unto the Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> The word kavala in this verse refers to a morsel of rice mixed with yogurt that Kåñëa held in His left hand. According to Sanätana Gosvämé, the Lord held a cowherding stick and a buffalo horn pressed under His left arm, and His flute was placed under His belt. Beautiful young Kåñëa, decorated with multicolored forest minerals, exhibited opulences far greater than those of Vaikuëöha. Although Brahmä had seen innumerable four-armed forms of the Lord, he now surrendered unto the lotus feet of the two-armed form of Kåñëa, who appeared as the son of Nanda Mahäräja. Brahmä offered his prayers to that form.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear Lord, neither I nor anyone else can estimate the potency of this transcendental body of Yours, which has shown such mercy to me and which appears just to fulfill the desires of Your pure devotees. Although my mind is completely withdrawn from material affairs, I cannot understand Your personal form. How, then, could I possibly understand the happiness You experience within Yourself?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Chapter Fourteen, Çréla Prabhupäda explains that in the present verse Lord Brahmä expressed the following prayerful sentiment: "Your appearance as a cowherd child is for the benefit of the devotees, and although I have committed an offense at Your lotus feet by stealing away Your boys and calves, I can understand that You have bestowed Your mercy upon me. That is Your transcendental quality: You are very affectionate toward Your devotees. But in spite of Your great affection for me, I cannot estimate the potency of Your bodily activities. It is to be understood that when I, Lord Brahmä, the supreme personality of this universe, cannot estimate the childlike body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then what to speak of others? And if I cannot estimate the spiritual potency of Your childlike body, then what can I understand about Your transcendental pastimes? Therefore, as it is said in the Bhagavad-gétä, anyone who can understand a little of the transcendental pastimes, appearance and disappearance of the Lord immediately becomes eligible to enter the kingdom of God after quitting the material body. This statement is confirmed in the Vedas, where it is stated. Simply by understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can overcome the chain of repeated birth and death. I therefore recommend that people should not try to understand You by their speculative knowledge."</div>
<div class="First"> When Brahmä disrespected the supreme status of the Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa first bewildered him by exhibiting the Lord's own transcendental power. Then, having humbled His devotee Brahmä, Kåñëa gave him His personal audience.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, Lord Kåñëa's transcendental body can also function through the agency of His plenary expansions, called viñëu-tattva. As stated by Brahmä himself in the Brahma-saàhitä (5.32): aìgäni yasya sakalendriya-våttimanti. This verse indicates not only that the Lord can perform any bodily function with any of His limbs but also that He can see through the eyes of His Viñëu expansions or, indeed, through the eyes of any living entity, and similarly that He can hear through the ears of any Viñëu or jéva expansion. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura points out that although the Lord can perform any function with any one of His senses, in His transcendental pastimes as Çré Kåñëa He generally sees with His eyes, touches with His hands, hears with His ears and so on. Thus He behaves like the most beautiful and charming young cowherd boy. The Vedic knowledge expands from Lord Brahmä, who is described in the first verse of Çrémad-Bhägavatam as ädi-kavi, the primeval Vedic scholar. Yet Brahmä could not understand the transcendental body of Lord Kåñëa, because it is beyond the reach of ordinary Vedic knowledge. Among all the transcendental forms of the Lord, the two-armed form of Govinda-Kåñëa—is original and supreme. Thus Lord Govinda's pastimes of stealing butter, drinking the gopés' breast-milk, tending the calves, playing His flute and playing childhood sports are extraordinary even in comparison with the activities of the Lord's Viñëu expansions.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Those who, even while remaining situated in their established social positions, throw away the process of speculative knowledge and with their body, words and mind offer all respects to descriptions of Your personality and activities, dedicating their lives to these narrations, which are vibrated by You personally and by Your pure devotees, certainly conquer Your Lordship, although You are otherwise unconquerable by anyone within the three worlds.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Here the word udapäsya clearly indicates that one should not even slightly endeavor to understand the Absolute Truth by the process of mental speculation, for it invariably carries one to an imperfect, impersonal understanding of God. The word jévanti indicates that a devotee who always hears about Lord Kåñëa will go back home, back to Godhead, even if he can do nothing except maintain his existence and hear topics concerning the Lord. Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé has explained the words tanu-väì-manobhiù ("by the body, words and mind") in three ways. In reference to devotees, through their body, words and mind they are able to conquer Lord Kåñëa. Thus becoming perfect in Kåñëa consciousness, they can touch His lotus feet with their hands, call Him to come with their words, and attain His direct audience within their mind simply by thinking about Him.</div>
<div class="First"> In the case of nondevotees, the words tanu-väì-manobhiù refer to the word ajita, "unconquered," and indicate that those not engaged in the loving service of Lord Kåñëa cannot conquer the Absolute Truth by their bodily strength, verbal expertise or mental power. Despite all their endeavors, the ultimate truth remains beyond their reach.</div>
<div class="First"> In reference to the word jitaù, "conquered," the words tanu-väì-manobhiù indicate that the pure devotees of Lord Kåñëa conquer His body, words and mind. Lord Kåñëa's body is conquered because He always remains by the side of His pure devotees; Lord Kåñëa's words are conquered because He always chants the glories of His devotees; and Lord Kåñëa's mind is conquered because He always thinks about His loving devotees.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has explained the words tanu-väì-manobhiù in regard to the word namantaù, "offering obeisances." He explains that the devotees can take full advantage of the transcendental topics of the Lord by offering all respects to those topics with their body, words and mind. One should engage his body by touching the ground with his hands and head while offering obeisances to the topics of the Lord; one should engage his words by praising transcendental literatures such as Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam, as well as the devotees who are preaching such literatures; and one should engage his mind by feeling great reverence and pleasure while hearing the transcendental topics of the Lord. In this way, a sincere devotee who has acquired even a small amount of transcendental knowledge about Lord Kåñëa can conquer Him and thus go back home, back to Godhead, for eternal life at the Lord's side.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> My dear Lord, devotional service unto You is the best path for self-realization. If someone gives up that path and engages in the cultivation of speculative knowledge, he will simply undergo a troublesome process and will not achieve his desired result. As a person who beats an empty husk of wheat cannot get grain, one who simply speculates cannot achieve self-realization. His only gain is trouble.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Loving service to the Supreme Person is the natural and eternal function of every living entity. If a person renounces his own constitutional function and instead laboriously seeks so-called enlightenment through impersonal, speculative knowledge, his result is simply the trouble and bother that come from following an artificial process. A fool may beat an empty husk, not knowing that the grain has already been removed. Similarly foolish is the person who throws his mind again and again into the pursuit of knowledge without surrendering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for it is the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is the very substance and goal of knowledge, just as grain is the substance and goal of the entire agricultural effort. Vedic knowledge or, indeed, material science without the Personality of Godhead is exactly like an empty and useless husk of wheat. One may argue that by practicing yoga or cultivating impersonal knowledge one can acquire prestige, wealth, mystic powers or even impersonal liberation. But these so-called gains are actually useless, because they do not situate the living being in his constitutional position of loving service to the Supreme Lord. Therefore such results, being superfluous to the living being's essential nature, are impermanent. As stated in the Nåsiàha Puräëa, patreñu puñpeñu phaleñu toyeñv akréta-labhyeñu vadaiva satsu/ bhaktyä su-labhye puruñe puräëe muktyai kim arthaà kriyate prayatnaù: "Since the primeval Personality of Godhead is easily attained by offering Him such things as leaves, flowers, fruits and water, which are all found without difficulty, why does one need to endeavor for liberation separately?"</div>
<div class="First"> Although the process of devotional service to Lord Kåñëa is very simple, it is extremely difficult for stubborn conditioned souls to completely humble themselves before the Supreme Personality of Godhead and absorb themselves twenty-four hours a day in His loving service. The mood of loving service is anathema to belligerent conditioned souls determined to defy God and enjoy. When such stubborn conditioned souls attempt to bypass surrendering to God through proud attempts at philosophical speculation, austerity, and yoga, they are turned back to the material platform by the powerful laws of God and violently merged into the heaving ocean of insignificance called the material world.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Nondevotees, however, cannot realize You in Your full personal feature. Nevertheless, it may be possible for them to realize Your expansion as the impersonal Supreme by cultivating direct perception of the Self within the heart. But they can do this only by purifying their mind and senses of all conceptions of material distinctions and all attachment to material sense objects. Only in this way will Your impersonal feature manifest itself to them.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> It is difficult for conditioned souls to understand all the transcendental features of the Supreme Lord. As confirmed in the First Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.2.11): brahmeti paramätmeti bhagavän iti çabdyate. The transcendental existence of God is understood progressively as the impersonal effulgence, the localized Supersoul in one's heart, and finally the Supreme Personality of Godhead existing in His eternal abode. Lord Kåñëa's transcendental existence is beyond the qualities of material nature. Thus here the Lord is referred to as aguëasya, without material qualities. Even by practicing yoga or engaging in advanced philosophical speculation, one will find it very difficult to understand clearly the transcendental existence beyond the modes of material nature. And these processes are virtually useless for understanding the Lord's own unlimited transcendental qualities, which are far beyond the impersonal conception of spiritual existence. Only by the mercy of the pure devotees of the Lord or by associating with the Lord Himself can one begin the process of realizing the personal feature of God—a process that culminates in pure Kåñëa consciousness, the final and supreme perfection of knowledge.</div>

<div class="Translation"> In time, learned philosophers or scientists might be able to count all the atoms of the earth, the particles of snow, or perhaps even the shining molecules radiating from the sun, the stars and other luminaries. But among these learned men, who could possibly count the unlimited transcendental qualities possessed by You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who have descended onto the surface of the earth for the benefit of all living entities?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé explains that Lord Kåñëa is guëätmä, "the soul of all superior qualities," because He gives them life. For example, one may discuss in an abstract way such qualities as generosity, intelligence and mercy, but they come to life only when a living person exhibits them. Thus Lord Kåñëa is guëätmä because He descends to the material world and reestablishes religious principles by exhibiting all godly qualities Himself and inspiring them in others. A living entity who develops the transcendental qualities found in the Lord receives immeasurable benefit and eventually goes with the Lord back to His own abode, where all living beings are liberated and fully endowed with the transcendental nature.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé further explains that the Lord manifests a specific spiritual quality for the benefit of each living entity. Since there are innumerable living entities within the confines of the material creation, the Lord manifests infinite qualities. Thus every conditioned soul can appreciate the Supreme Lord in a particular way.</div>
<div class="First"> The example is given here that even if the most learned scholars could someday count the particles of earth, snow and light, they would still fail to understand the qualities of the Lord. In this example earth, snow and light are progressively more subtle; thus it is to be understood that there is an increasing difficulty in counting their virtually infinite particles. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, great personalities like Lord Saìkarñaëa actually have counted the number of atoms on the earth, and even the molecules in the entire universe. Yet even such a personality as Saìkarñaëa, who has been continuously chanting the glories of the Lord since time immemorial, has not even approached a final count of those glories. Lord Kåñëa exhibits His most astonishing qualities during His childhood pastimes in Våndävana, where He steals butter from the cowherd ladies, dances with His girlfriends, and plays with His cowherd boyfriends as their most dear companion. Although appearing like ordinary human activities, such sublime pastimes embody Lord Kåñëa's immeasurable and innumerable beautiful transcendental qualities, which are the life and soul of the pure devotees.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear Lord, one who earnestly waits for You to bestow Your causeless mercy upon him, all the while patiently suffering the reactions of his past misdeeds and offering You respectful obeisances with his heart, words and body, is surely eligible for liberation, for it has become his rightful claim.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Çrédhara Svämé explains in his commentary that just as a legitimate son has to simply remain alive to gain an inheritance from his father, one who simply remains alive in Kåñëa consciousness, following the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga, automatically becomes eligible to receive the mercy of the Personality of Godhead. In other words, he will be promoted to the kingdom of God.</div>
<div class="First"> The word su-samékñamäëa indicates that a devotee earnestly awaits the mercy of the Supreme Lord even while suffering the painful effects of previous sinful activities. Lord Kåñëa explains in the Bhagavad-gétä that a devotee who fully surrenders unto Him is no longer liable to suffer the reactions of his previous karma. However, because in his mind a devotee may still maintain the remnants of his previous sinful mentality, the Lord removes the last vestiges of the enjoying spirit by giving His devotee punishments that may sometimes resemble sinful reactions. The purpose of the entire creation of God is to rectify the living entity's tendency to enjoy without the Lord, and therefore the particular punishment given for a sinful activity is specifically designed to curtail the mentality that produced the activity. Although a devotee has surrendered to the Lord's devotional service, until he is completely perfect in Kåñëa consciousness he may maintain a slight inclination to enjoy the false happiness of this world. The Lord therefore creates a particular situation to eradicate this remaining enjoying spirit. This unhappiness suffered by a sincere devotee is not technically a karmic reaction; it is rather the Lord's special mercy for inducing His devotee to completely let go of the material world and return home, back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="First"> A sincere devotee earnestly desires to go back to the Lord's abode. Therefore he willingly accepts the Lord's merciful punishment and continues offering respects and obeisances to the Lord with his heart, words and body. Such a bona fide servant of the Lord, considering all hardship a small price to pay for gaining the personal association of the Lord, certainly becomes a legitimate son of God, as indicated here by the words däya-bhäk. Just as one cannot approach the sun without becoming fire, one cannot approach the supreme pure, Lord Kåñëa, without undergoing a rigid purificatory process, which may appear like suffering but which is in fact a curative treatment administered by the personal hand of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> A great fire produces many sparks, which are insignificant in comparison to it. Indeed, if one of the small sparks were to try to burn the original fire, the attempt would be simply ludicrous. Similarly, even the creator of the entire universe, Lord Brahmä, is an insignificant spark of the potency of God, and therefore Brahmä's attempt to bewilder the Supreme Lord was certainly ludicrous.</div>
<div class="First"> Brahmä here addresses Lord Kåñëa as éça, which indicates that Kåñëa is not only the supreme master of everyone but is also specifically the master of Brahmä, who creates the universe directly under the guidance of the Lord and who, indeed, is born directly from the Lord's own body. Brahmä felt ashamed of his impudent attempt at deluding Lord Kåñëa, and he was therefore perfectly willing to be punished or forgiven by the Lord, according to His decision. If Lord Kåñëa does not mercifully punish His devotees when they act improperly, their foolishness will simply increase and gradually completely overwhelm their devotional sentiments. Therefore Lord Kåñëa kindly disciplines His devotees and maintains them on the progressive path back home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In his commentary, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains that Brahmä wanted to present the following argument to the Lord: "My dear Lord, because I have acted so badly I certainly deserve to be punished. On the other hand, because I am so ignorant You should consider me an innocent fool and be merciful to me. Thus, although I deserve both punishment and forgiveness, I humbly beg You to exercise tolerance in this matter and simply forgive me and show me Your mercy."</div>
<div class="First"> The words näthavän iti indicate that Lord Brahmä wanted to humbly remind Lord Kåñëa that He was, after all, Brahmä's father and master and should therefore forgive the unfortunate transgressions of His humble servant. Every conditioned soul, whether he be Lord Brahmä or an insignificant ant, falsely identifies himself with the material world and in this way forgets his eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Brahmä, because of his prestigious position as the cosmic creator, also tends to identify himself as the lord of this world, and thus he sometimes forgets his position as an insignificant servant of the Supreme Lord. Now, by Lord Kåñëa's mercy, this false identification is being rectified and Lord Brahmä is remembering his constitutional position as the eternal servant of God.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In the Caitanya-caritämåta, Ädi-lélä, Chapter Five, Text 72, Çréla Prabhupäda gives the following purport for this verse: "Then Lord Brahmä, after having stolen all Kåñëa's cows and cowherd boys, returned and saw that the cows and boys were still roaming with Kåñëa, he offered this prayer in his defeat. A conditioned soul—even one so great as Brahmä, who manages the affairs of the entire universe—cannot compare to the Personality of Godhead, for He can produce numberless universes simply by the spiritual rays emanating from the pores of His body. Material scientists should take lessons from the utterances of Çré Brahmä regarding our insignificance in comparison with God. In these prayers of Brahmä there is much to learn for those who are falsely puffed up by the accumulation of power."</div>
<div class="First"> In Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Chapter Fourteen, Çréla Prabhupäda further comments on this verse: "Lord Brahmä realized his actual position. He is certainly the supreme teacher of this universe, in charge of the production of material nature, consisting of the complete material energy, false ego, sky, air, fire, water and earth. Such a universe may be gigantic, but it can be measured, just as we measure our body as seven spans. Generally, everyone's personal bodily measurement is calculated to be seven spans of his hand. This particular universe may appear to be a very gigantic body, but it is nothing but the measurement of seven spans for Lord Brahmä."</div>
<div class="First"> Aside from this universe, there are unlimited other universes outside the jurisdiction of this particular Lord Brahmä. Just as innumerable atomic infinitesimal fragments pass through the holes of a screened window, so millions and trillions of universes in their seedling form are coming out from the bodily pores of Mahä-Viñëu, and that Mahä-Viñëu is but a part of the plenary expansion of Kåñëa. Under these circumstances, although Lord Brahmä is the supreme creature within this universe, what is his importance in the presence of Lord Kåñëa?</div>

<div class="First"> Çréla Prabhupäda comments as follows on this verse in Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Chapter Fourteen: "Lord Brahmä therefore compared himself to a little child within the womb of his mother. If the child within the womb plays with his hands and legs, and while playing touches the body of the mother, is the mother offended with the child? Of course she isn't. Similarly, Lord Brahmä may be a very great personality, and yet not only Brahmä but everything that be is existing within the womb of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord's energy is all-pervading: there is no place in the creation where it is not acting. Since everything is existing within the energy of the Lord, the Brahmä of this universe or the Brahmäs of the many other millions and trillions of universes are existing within the energy of the Lord; therefore the Lord is considered to be the mother, and everything existing within the womb of the mother is considered to be the child. And the good mother is never offended with the child, even if he touches the body of the mother by kicking his legs."</div>

Ultimately, all living beings are equally expansions of the transcendental body of the Supreme Lord. But Brahmä has an intimate relationship with the Lord because of the activities of universal creation, and so he uses the prefix vi in the word vinirgata to beg the Lord's special mercy. Lord Brahmä is called aja because he is not born from any mother but rather emanates directly from the body of the Lord. As Çréla Prabhupäda states in Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, "It is naturally concluded that the mother of Brahmä is Näräyaëa." On these grounds, Lord Brahmä is requesting special forgiveness for his offenses.</div>

<div class="First"> In the Caitanya-caritämåta, Ädi-lélä, Chapter Two, Text 30, Çréla Prabhupäda comments on this verse as follows: "This statement was spoken by Lord Brahmä in his prayers to Lord Kåñëa after the Lord defeated him by displaying His mystic powers. Brahmä had tried to test Lord Kåñëa to see if He was really the Supreme Personality of Godhead playing as a cowherd boy. Brahmä stole all the other boys and their cows from the pasturing grounds, but when he returned to the pastures he saw that all the boys and cows were still there, for Lord Kåñëa had created them all again. When Brahmä saw this mystic power of Lord Kåñëa, he admitted defeat and offered prayers to the Lord, addressing Him as the proprietor and seer of everything in the creation and as the Supersoul who is within each and every living entity and is dear to all. Lord Kåñëa is Näräyaëa, the father of Brahmä, because Lord Kåñëa's plenary expansion Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, after placing Himself on the Garbha Ocean, created Brahmä from His own body. Mahä-Viñëu in the Causal Ocean and Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, the Supersoul in everyone's heart, are also transcendental expansions of the Supreme Truth."</div>
<div class="First"> In his commentary on this verse, Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé has elaborately explained the expansion of the Viñëu, or Näräyaëa, incarnations from the original form of Godhead, Lord Çré Kåñëa.

<div class="First"> Lord Brahmä here refers to his experience at the dawn of cosmic creation. As described in the Second Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Lord Brahmä took birth on the seat of a giant lotus whose stem emanated from the navel of Näräyaëa. Brahmä was bewildered as to his whereabouts, function and identity, and therefore he tried to trace out the source of the lotus stem, searching for clear information. Unable to find the Personality of Godhead, he returned to his seat and engaged in severe austerities, having been ordered to do so by the transcendental voice of the Lord, who could be heard but not seen. After long meditation, Brahmä saw the Lord but then again lost sight of Him. Thus Brahmä concludes that the transcendental body of the Personality of Godhead is not material but rather an eternal, spiritual form endowed with inconceivable mystic potencies. In other words, Lord Brahmä should not have challenged the Personality of Godhead, the Lord of all mystic power.</div>

One may argue that since the universes seen by mother Yaçodä within Lord Kåñëa's abdomen were within the Lord's body, they are different from the illusory material universes manifest externally. Here Lord Brahmä refutes that argument, however. Lord Kåñëa is mäyä-dhamana, the supreme controller of illusion. By the Lord's own supreme mystic potency, He can bewilder even illusion herself, and thus the Lord actually exhibited all the material universes within His body. This is mäyätvam, the supreme bewildering potency of the Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Brahmä previously stated that Lord Kåñëa incarnates among the demigods, human beings, animals, fish and so on. This does not mean, however, that the Lord is degraded by His incarnations. As Brahmä clarifies here, no conditioned soul can understand the transcendental nature of the Lord's activities, which He enacts through His spiritual potency. Although the Lord is bhüman, the supremely great one, He is still Bhagavän, the supremely beautiful personality exhibiting pastimes of love in His own abode. At the same time He is Paramätmä, the all-pervading Supersoul, who witnesses and sanctions all the activities of conditioned souls. The Lord's multiple identity is explained by the term yogeçvara. The Absolute Truth is the master of all mystic potencies, and although He is one and supreme, He manifests His greatness and opulence in many different ways.</div>
<div class="First"> Such elevated spiritual matters can hardly be understood by foolish persons primitively identifying themselves with the insignificant material body. These conditioned souls, such as atheistic scientists, consider their own puffed-up intelligence supreme. Gullibly placing their firm faith in material illusion, they are captured by the modes of nature and driven far away from knowledge of God.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Therefore this entire universe, which like a dream is by nature unreal, nevertheless appears real, and thus it covers one's consciousness and assails one with repeated miseries. This universe appears real because it is manifested by the potency of illusion emanating from You, whose unlimited transcendental forms are full of eternal happiness and knowledge.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> As an object of enjoyment or a permanent residence for the conditioned souls, the material universe is certainly illusion, nothing more than a dream. One may give the analogy that the vision of abundant water in a desert is no more than a dream, although real water exists elsewhere. Similarly, the vision of home, happiness and reality within matter is certainly no better than a foolish dream in which repeated miseries appear.</div>
<div class="First"> In another sense, however, the universe is real. In his commentary on Vedanta-sütra, Çréla Madhväcärya has confirmed this by quoting the following statement from the Vedic çruti-mantras: satyaà hy evedaà viçvam asåjata. "This universe, created by the Lord, is real." The perfect authority of the Vedas thus certifies this universe to be real; nevertheless, because our knowledge is stolen by illusion (as indicated here by the words asta-dhiñaëam), we cannot properly understand this universe or the Supreme Lord who has created it. As the expansion of Lord Kåñëa, the universe is real and is meant for being engaged in His service. One who accepts the kingdom of God as home, the Lord Himself as the object of love, and the material universe as paraphernalia for being engaged in the Lord's service dwells within eternal reality wherever he may go within the material and spiritual worlds.</div>

<div class="Translation"> You are the one Supreme Soul, the primeval Supreme Personality, the Absolute Truth—self-manifested, endless and beginningless. You are eternal and infallible, perfect and complete, without any rival and free from all material designations. Your happiness can never be obstructed, nor have You any connection with material contamination. Indeed, You are the indestructible nectar of immortality.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Çrédhara Svämé explains how the various terms of this verse demonstrate that the transcendental body of Lord Kåñëa is free from the characteristics of material bodies. All material bodies go through six phases: birth, growth, maturity, reproduction, decline and destruction. But Lord Kåñëa does not take material birth, since He is the original reality, a fact clearly indicated here by the word adya, "original." We take our material birth within a particular material atmosphere, in material bodies that are amalgamations of various material elements. Since Lord Kåñëa existed long before the creation of any material atmosphere or element, there is no question of material birth for His transcendental body.</div>
<div class="First"> Similarly, the word pürëa, meaning "full and complete," refutes the concept that Lord Kåñëa could grow, since He is ever-existing in fullness. When one's material body becomes mature, one can no longer enjoy as in youth; but the words ajasra-sukha, "enjoying unobstructed happiness," indicate that Lord Kåñëa's body never reaches so-called middle age, since it is always full of spiritual youthful bliss. The word akñara, "undiminishing," refutes the possibility that Lord Kåñëa's body grows old or declines, and the word amåta, "immortal" negates the possibility of death.</div>
<div class="First"> In other words, Lord Kåñëa's transcendental body is free from the transformations of material bodies. The Lord does, however, create innumerable worlds and expand Himself as innumerable living entities. But the Lord's so-called reproduction is completely spiritual and does not take place at a certain phase of bodily existence; rather, it constitutes the Lord's eternal proclivity to expand His spiritual bliss and glories. As the Lord states in çruti, pürvam eväham ihäsam: "I alone existed in the beginning." Therefore here the Lord is called puruñaù puräëaù, "the primeval enjoyer. "This original puruña expands Himself as the Supersoul and enters every living being. Still, He is ultimately the Absolute Truth, Kåñëa, as stated in the Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad: yaù säkñät para-brahmeti govindaà sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaà våndävana-sura-bhüruha-taläsénam. "The Absolute Truth Himself is Govinda, who has an eternal form of bliss and knowledge and who is sitting beneath the shady desire trees of Våndävana." This Absolute Truth is beyond material ignorance and beyond even ordinary spiritual knowledge, as stated in the same Gopäla-täpané çruti: vidyävidyäbhyäà bhinnaù. Thus, in many ways the supremacy of Lord Kåñëa has been established in the Vedic literature, and it is here confirmed by Lord Brahmä himself.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Those submerged in illusion see material existence as infinite, just as one who is submerged in water sees only water all around him. For example, material scientists and philosophers, submerged deep within the ocean of material illusion, imagine that material nature extends infinitely in all directions. In fact, the material creation is a finite ocean of ignorance in which foolish living entities, such as material scientists, are unceremoniously dunked by the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="First"> To be trapped in a world in which all things are born and die is certainly a fearful experience. Anyone trapped in a dark place naturally becomes fearful. Since material life is always covered by the darkness of ignorance, every conditioned soul is fearful. The material nature is not ultimate reality, and thus analysis of matter can never provide answers to ultimate questions. This dark, snakelike existence called material life immediately disappears as soon as one opens his eyes to the bright light of Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> The conception of material bondage and the conception of liberation are both manifestations of ignorance. Being outside the scope of true knowledge, they cease to exist when one correctly understands that the pure spirit soul is distinct from matter and always fully conscious. At that time bondage and liberation no longer have any significance, just as day and night have no significance from the perspective of the sun.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Material bondage is illusion because the living entity actually has no real relationship with the material world. Because of false ego, the conditioned soul identifies himself with matter. Therefore so-called liberation is simply the giving up of an illusion rather than release from actual bondage. Yet even if we think that the suffering of material illusion is real and that liberation is thus a meaningful release from suffering, the mere absence of material existence is still insignificant compared to the achievement of factual spiritual life, which is the positive eternal reality opposed to the negative illusion of material life. Ultimately, Kåñëa consciousness, or pure love of Godhead, is the only significant, meaningful and permanent status for every living entity. Since the darkness of night is caused by the absence of the sun, one would not experience night within the sun itself, nor would one experience individual days separated by nights. Similarly, within the pure living entity there is no material darkness and thus no experience of liberation from such darkness. When the conditioned soul comes to this platform of pure consciousness, he becomes fit to associate with the supreme pure, the Personality of Godhead Himself, in the Lord's own abode.</div>

Unfortunately, such speculators are not inclined to hear from the Lord Himself or from the Lord's authorized representatives, such as Lord Brahmä.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> One may argue that a person should cultivate self-realization and at the same time pursue sense gratification for the material body. This proposition is herein refuted by the example of misidentifying a rope as a snake. One who mistakes a rope for a snake becomes fearful and thinks of the so-called snake. But upon discovering that the so-called snake is actually a rope, he experiences a different emotion—relief—and can then ignore the rope. Similarly, because we misunderstand the material body to be the self, we are experiencing many emotions in relation to the body. Upon discovering, however, that the body is simply a bag of material chemicals, we carefully note how this illusion was created and then lose interest in the body. Discovering that we are actually an eternal soul within the body, we naturally focus our attention on that real self. Those who are saintly and wise always cultivate Kåñëa consciousness, spiritual knowledge, having transcended the foolish misidentification of the body as the self. Such Kåñëa conscious persons go on to realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who dwells within the material body as the Supersoul—the witness and guide of every living entity. Realization of the Supersoul and the individual soul is so pleasing and satisfying that a self-realized person automatically gives up everything irrelevant to his spiritual advancement.</div>

<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa is very eager to bestow His mercy upon the conditioned living beings, who are uselessly struggling with the Lord's illusory energy, Mäyä. The conditioned soul struggles for happiness through sense gratification and for knowledge through mental speculation. Both processes ultimately bring him to a morose and hopeless condition. If the conditioned soul surrenders to the lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa and thus acquires even a trace of His causeless mercy, the whole situation is changed, and the living entity can begin his real life of bliss and knowledge in Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> This verse indicates that Lord Brahmä desires to take birth even as the smallest blade of grass in Våndävana so that the holy residents of the Lord's abode may walk upon his head and bless him with the dust of their feet. Being realistic, Lord Brahmä does not aspire to directly achieve the dust of Lord Kåñëa's feet; rather, he aspires for the mercy of the Lord's devotees. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains that Brahmä is willing to take birth even as a stone in a paved footpath in the Lord's abode. Since Brahmä is the creator of the entire universe, we can just imagine the glorious position of the residents of Våndävana.</div>
<div class="First"> The Lord's devotees achieve their exalted position by unalloyed devotion and love. One cannot achieve such spiritual opulence by any puffed-up material process of personal improvement. In Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çréla Prabhupäda reveals the mind of Brahmä as follows: "But if I am not so fortunate as to take birth within the forest of Våndävana, I beg to be allowed to take birth outside the immediate area of Våndävana so that when the devotees go out they will walk over me. Even that would be a great fortune for me. I am just aspiring for a birth in which I will be smeared by the dust of the devotees' feet."</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Apparently, the residents of Våndävana, the abode of Lord Kåñëa, are simple householders engaged in ordinary affairs such as herding cows, cooking, rearing children and performing religious ceremonies. However, all these activities are intensely engaged in the loving service of Lord Kåñëa. The residents of Våndävana perform all activities in pure Kåñëa consciousness and thus exist on the most exalted platform of liberated life. Otherwise, the same activities performed without Kåñëa consciousness constitute ordinary bondage to the material world.</div>
<div class="First"> Thus, one should not misunderstand the exalted position of the residents of Våndävana, nor should one consider oneself highly religious simply because one performs ordinary domestic affairs very enthusiastically, but without Kåñëa consciousness. By focusing our passionate attachment on our family and society, we are completely deviated from the progressive path of Kåñëa consciousness. Conversely, if we engage our family in the loving service of the Lord, our endeavors to maintain our family become part and parcel of our progressive spiritual duties.</div>
<div class="First"> In conclusion, by studying the extraordinary status of the residents of Våndävana, we can see that the essential quality of their lives is pure Kåñëa consciousness—the rendering of loving service to the Lord without a trace of material desire or mental speculation. Such loving service to the original Personality of Godhead immediately creates the atmosphere of Çré Våndävana-dhäma, the kingdom of God.</div>

Lord Kåñëa comes to the earth and acts toward His pure devotees exactly like a devoted son, boyfriend, husband, father, friend and so on, and within the darkness of material existence these brilliant, liberated pastimes give unlimited ecstasy to the surrendered devotees of the Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> In his Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çréla Prabhupäda quotes Lord Brahmä as follows: "I can also understand that Your appearance as a small cowherd boy, a child of the cowherd men, is not at all a material activity.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In his Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çréla Prabhupäda has quoted Lord Brahmä as follows: "My dear Lord, although You are the Supreme Lord of all creation, I sometimes falsely think that I am the master of this universe. I may be master of this universe, but there are innumerable universes, and there are also innumerable Brahmäs who preside over these universes. But actually You are the master of them all. As the Supersoul in everyone's heart, You know everything. Please, therefore, accept me as Your surrendered servant. I hope that You will excuse me for disturbing You in Your pastimes with Your friends and calves. Now if You will kindly allow me, I will immediately leave so You can enjoy Your friends and calves without my presence."</div>
<div class="First"> The words sarvaà tvaà vetsi sarva-dåk are very significant here. Lord Kåñëa knows everything and sees everything, and therefore Lord Brahmä did not need to remain in Våndävana to maintain his personal loving contact with the Lord. In fact, as the creator of the universe, Lord Brahmä was somewhat out of place in the simple, blissful atmosphere of Våndävana, where Lord Kåñëa was exhibiting His supreme opulences in herding cows, enjoying picnics, playing games and so on.</div>
<div class="First"> Upon seeing the intense love the residents of Våndävana had for Lord Kåñëa, Brahmä felt unqualified to remain there. He was not eager to give up the Lord's association, but he felt it better to return to his personal devotional service in Brahmaloka. Somewhat embarrassed and unhappy over his foolish attempt at bewildering the Lord, Brahmä preferred to resume his transcendental loving service rather than try to enjoy the Lord's presence.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé, Lord Brahmä is here engaged in the ecstasy of näma-saìkértana, glorifying various holy names of Lord Kåñëa that indicate His variegated pastimes. Lord Kåñëa expertly suppressed the demoniac population of the earth, which became unbearable with the advent of demoniac politicians like Kaàsa, Jaräsandha and Çiçupäla. Similarly, in modern society there are many so-called God-fearing people who are actually attracted to demoniac existence. Such persons become enlivened with the setting of the sun and go out in the darkness to enjoy life in restaurants, nightclubs, discotheques, hotels and so on, which are all simply meant for illicit sex, intoxication, gambling and meat-eating. Then there are those who openly defy God and His laws, declaring themselves atheists and demons. Both the covert and the overt enemies of the Lord constitute an unholy burden for the earth, and Lord Kåñëa descends to expertly remove this burden. Here Lord Brahmä indirectly states that Lord Kåñëa should remove Brahmä's own subtle atheism, which had led him to try to exert illusory power over Lord Kåñëa. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, Lord Brahmä, in his shame, felt himself to be like a brahma-räkñasa from Satyaloka who had come to the earth to disturb Lord Kåñëa and His intimate friends and calves. Brahmä is lamenting that although Lord Kåñëa is most exalted, the Lord of all lords, because He had appeared before Brahmä in such a simple and innocent feature—decorated with a stick, a conchshell, ornaments, red clay, a peacock feather and so on, and sporting with His cowherd boyfriends—Brahmä dared to challenge Him. Concerning Brahmä's prayers, of which this verse is the conclusion, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura states, "May these prayers of Brahmä, which take away all doubts and broadcast all the definitive conclusions of devotional service, become the expert craftsmanship of the foundation of my consciousness."</div>

<div class="First"> Although Lord Brahmä had prayed to take birth as a blade of grass in Våndävana or even in the area surrounding Våndävana, Lord Kåñëa, by His silent response to Brahmä's prayers, indicated that Brahmä should return to his own abode. First Brahmä had to complete his personal devotional service of universal creation; then he could come to Våndävana and get the mercy of the inhabitants there. In other words, a devotee should always be attentive to executing his personal devotional service properly. This is more important than trying to live in the Lord's abode.</div>

<div class="Translation"> After granting His son Brahmä permission to leave, the Supreme Personality of Godhead took the calves, who were still where they had been a year earlier, and brought them to the riverbank, where He had been taking His meal and where His cowherd boyfriends remained just as before.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word sva-bhuvam, "to His own son," indicates that Lord Kåñëa forgave the offense Brahmä had committed and treated him with affection, as His son. It is stated in this verse that the original cowherd boyfriends and calves were situated just as before: near the bank of the Yamunä River and in the forest, respectively. Previously the calves had disappeared within the forest and Lord Kåñëa had gone to search for them. Not finding them, the Lord had returned to the riverbank to discuss the situation with His cowherd boyfriends, but they had also disappeared. Now the cows were once again in the forest and the boyfriends once again on the bank of the river, ready to take their lunch. According to Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé, the calves and boys remained in the forest and on the riverbank, respectively, for one full year. Lord Brahmä did not actually take them away to another place. By the Lord's omnipotent illusory energy, the gopés and other residents of Våndävana did not notice the calves and boys, nor did the calves and boys notice the passing of a year's time or feel any hunger, cold or thirst. All this was part of the pastime arranged by the Lord's illusory potency. Lord Brahmä thought, "I have kept all the boys and calves of Gokula sleeping on the bed of my mystic potency, and to this very day they have not risen. A similar number of boys and calves have been playing with Kåñëa for one whole year, yet they are different from the ones illusioned by my mystic potency. Who are they? Where did they come from?" Nothing is invisible to the Supreme Lord. Thus Lord Kåñëa appeared to be searching for the calves and boys only to enact the dramatic pastime of bewildering Lord Brahmä. After Brahmä surrendered and offered prayers, Lord Kåñëa returned to the original boys and calves, who appeared exactly as before, although their size had somewhat increased because of one year's growth.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, since Lord Kåñëa was playing exactly like an innocent young cowherd boy in Våndävana, after four-headed Brahmä offered his prayers the Lord maintained His role as a young cowherd boy and thus remained silent before Brahmä. Kåñëa's silence indicates the following thoughts: "Where did this four-headed Brahmä come from? What is he doing? What are these words he keeps on speaking? I am busy looking for My calves. I am just a cowherd boy and do not understand all this." Lord Brahmä had considered Lord Kåñëa an ordinary cowherd boy and had treated Him as such. After accepting Brahmä's prayers, Kåñëa continued to play as a cowherd boy and thus did not answer the four-headed Brahmä. Rather, Kåñëa was more interested in rejoining His cowherd boyfriends for the picnic lunch on the bank of the Yamunä River.</div>

<div class="First"> It is clearly stated here that the entire universe is bewildered. Thus even great demigods like Indra and Brahmä are not exempt from the principle of forgetfulness. Since Lord Kåñëa exercised His internal illusory potency over His cowherd boyfriends and calves, it is not at all astonishing that for one year they could not remember their position. Indeed, by the Lord's external illusory potency the conditioned souls forget their existence not only for one year but for many billions and billions of years as they transmigrate throughout the kingdom of ignorance called the material world.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Sometimes modern thinkers become puzzled when they study the psychology of moral behavior. Although every living entity is inclined toward self-preservation, as stated here, sometimes a person voluntarily sacrifices his own apparent interest through philanthropic or patriotic activities, such as giving his money for the benefit of others or giving his life for the national interest. Such so-called selfless behavior appears to contradict the principle of material self-centeredness and self-preservation.</div>
<div class="First"> As explained in this verse, however, a living entity serves his society, nation, family and so on only because these objects of affection represent the expanded concept of false ego. A patriot sees himself as a great servitor of a great nation, and thus he sacrifices his life to gratify his sense of egotism. Similarly, it is common knowledge that a man feels great pleasure by thinking that he is sacrificing everything to please his dear wife and children. A man derives great egotistic pleasure by seeing himself as a selfless well-wisher of his so-called family and community. Thus, to gratify his proud sense of false ego, a man is prepared even to lay down his life. This apparently contradictory behavior is yet another demonstration of the bewilderment of material life, which has neither rhyme nor reason, being a manifestation of gross ignorance of the nonmaterial soul.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word mamatä-bhäk is very significant here. An ordinary, foolish person thinks, "I am this body." A more discriminating, intelligent person thinks, "This is my body." In the literature and folklore of ordinary people we find the common theme of an old, decrepit person dreaming of obtaining a new, young body. Thus, even ordinary persons pick up the notion of self-realization, instinctively understanding that it is possible for the soul to exist in many different bodies.</div>
<div class="First"> As the body of an intelligent person becomes old and useless, he strongly desires to live, even when he knows that his body cannot live much longer. This indicates he is gradually becoming aware that his self is more important than his body. Thus simply the desire for life can indirectly bring one to a preliminary understanding of self-realization. And in this case as well, one's basic attachment is to one's own self and not to that which supposedly belongs to oneself.</div>
<div class="First"> It may be pointed out that the entire discussion between King Parékñit and Çukadeva Gosvämé regarding the dearness of one's own self is ultimately meant for broaching the subject of why the cows and cowherd ladies of Våndävana considered Kåñëa more dear than their own selves and certainly more dear than their own offspring.

<div class="First"> In the Caitanya-caritämåta, Madhya-léla, Chapter Twenty, Text 162, Çréla Prabhupäda comments on this verse as follows: "Parékñit Mahäräja asked Çukadeva Gosvämé why Kåñëa was so beloved by the residents of Våndävana, who loved Him even more than their own offspring or life itself. At that time, Çukadeva Gosvämé replied that everyone's ätmä, or soul, is very, very dear, especially to all living entities who have accepted material bodies. However, that ätmä, the spirit soul, is part and parcel of Kåñëa. For this reason, Kåñëa is very dear to every living entity. Everyone's body is very dear to oneself, and one wants to protect the body by all means because within the body the soul is living. Due to the intimate relationship between the soul and the body, the body is important and dear to everyone. Similarly, the soul, being part and parcel of Kåñëa, the Supreme Lord, is very, very dear to all living entities. Unfortunately, the soul forgets his constitutional position and thinks he is only the body (dehätma-buddhi). Thus the soul is subjected to the rules and regulations of material nature. When a living entity, by his intelligence, reawakens his attraction for Kåñëa, he can understand that he is not the body but part and parcel of Kåñëa. Thus filled with knowledge, he no longer labors under attachment to the body and everything related to the body (janasya moho 'yam ahaà mameti [SB 5.5.8]). Material existence, wherein one thinks, 'I am the body, and this belongs to me,' is also illusory. One must redirect his attraction to Kåñëa. Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.2.7) states,</div>

<div class="First"> Everything exists within Lord Kåñëa, and Lord Kåñëa exists within everything. Still, the order of progression is always from the energetic to the expanded energy. Lord Kåñëa is the original identity, from whom all other identities emanate. He is the supreme energetic, from whom all categories and dimensions of energy become manifest. Thus, our personal bodies, self, family, friends, nation, planet, universe and so on are all manifestations of the Supreme Lord, who expands Himself through His personal potencies. Lord Kåñëa is certainly the supreme object of our love and attraction, and other objects, such as body, family and home, should be secondary objects of our affection. Moreover, a close analytic study of the actual situation will reveal that even the secondary objects of love are also manifestations of Lord Kåñëa. The conclusion is that Lord Kåñëa is our only friend and object of love. In his Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çréla Prabhupäda comments on this verse as follows: "Without being an expansion of Kåñëa, nothing can be attractive. Whatever is attractive within the cosmic manifestation is due to Kåñëa. Kåñëa is therefore the reservoir of all pleasure. The active principle of everything is Kåñëa, and highly elevated transcendentalists see everything in connection with Him. In the Caitanya-caritämåta it is stated that a mahä-bhägavata, a highly advanced devotee, sees Kåñëa as the active principle in all movable and immovable living entities. Therefore he sees everything within this cosmic manifestation in relation to Kåñëa."</div>

<div class="First"> This translation is taken from Çréla Prabhupäda's commentary on the Bhagavad-gétä As It Is, Chapter Two, Text 51.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, this verse summarizes the knowledge presented in this section of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet are described as pallava, flower buds, because they are most tender and of a pinkish hue. According to Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé, the word pallava also indicates that Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet are just like desire trees, which can fulfill all the desires of the Lord's pure devotees. Even exalted devotees like Çré Närada, who are themselves the great shelter for the conditioned souls in this universe, personally take shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Çré Kåñëa. Thus it is natural that when Lord Kåñëa manifested Himself as all the young boys and calves of Våndävana, their parents were more attracted to them than previously. Lord Kåñëa is the reservoir of all pleasure and, being all-attractive, the ultimate object of everyone's love.</div>

Sometimes the boys would jump around like the monkeys in Lord Rämacandra's army and then enact the building of the bridge to Çré Laìkä by constructing play bridges in lakes or ponds. Sometimes the boys would imitate the pastime of churning the ocean of milk, and sometimes they would play catch with balls. We can find full pleasure in the spiritual world, with the simple condition that everything be performed in pure love of Godhead, Kåñëa consciousness.

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Fourteenth Chapter of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Brahmä's Prayers to Lord Kåñëa."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 15. The Killing of Dhenuka, the Ass Demon</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter describes how Lord Balaräma and Lord Kåñëa, while tending Their cows in the pastures of Våndävana, killed Dhenukäsura, enabled the residents of Våndävana to eat the fruits of the täla trees and saved the young cowherds from Käliya's poison.</div>
<div class="First"> Revealing Their boyhood (paugaëòa) phase of pastimes, Räma and Kåñëa were one day bringing the cows to pasture when They entered an attractive forest decorated with a clear lake. There They began playing forest sports along with Their friends. Pretending to tire, Lord Baladeva laid His head upon the lap of a cowherd boy and rested as Lord Kåñëa helped relieve His elder brother's fatigue by massaging His feet. Then Kåñëa also placed His head on the lap of a cowherd boy to rest, and another cowherd boy massaged His feet. In this way Kåñëa, Balaräma and Their cowherd friends enjoyed various pastimes.</div>
<div class="First"> During this play, Çrédämä, Subala, Stoka-kåñëa and other cowherd boys described to Räma and Kåñëa a wicked and irrepressible demon named Dhenuka, who had assumed the form of a jackass and was living in the Tälavana forest near Govardhana Hill. This forest was full of many varieties of sweet fruits. But fearing this demon, no one dared try to relish the taste of those fruits, and thus someone had to kill the demon and all his associates. Lord Räma and Lord Kåñëa, hearing of the situation, set off for this forest to fulfill the desire of Their companions.</div>
<div class="First"> Arriving at the Tälavana, Lord Balaräma shook many fruits out of the palm trees, and as soon as He did so the jackass demon, Dhenuka, ran swiftly to attack Him. But Balaräma grabbed his hind legs with one hand, whirled him around and threw him into the top of a tree, thus slaying him. All of Dhenukäsura's friends, overcome by fury, then rushed to attack, but Räma and Kåñëa took hold of them one by one, swung them around and killed them, until the disturbance was finally finished. When Kåñëa and Balaräma returned to the cowherd community, Yaçodä and Rohiëé placed Them on their respective laps. They kissed Their faces, fed Them with finely prepared food and then put Them to bed.</div>
<div class="First"> Some days later Lord Kåñëa went with His friends, but without His older brother, to the banks of the Kälindé in order to tend the cows. The cows and cowherd boys became very thirsty and drank some water from the Kälindé. But it had been contaminated with poison, and they all fell unconscious on the riverbank. Kåñëa then brought them back to life by the merciful rain of His glance, and all of them, regaining their consciousness, appreciated His great mercy.</div>

Engaging thus in the company of Their friends, the two boys rendered the land of Våndävana most auspicious by imprinting upon it the marks of Their lotus feet.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa wanted to encourage His cowherd boyfriends, who had been swallowed by Aghäsura and then stolen by Lord Brahmä. Therefore the Lord decided to bring them into the palm-tree forest called Tälavana, where there were many delicious ripe fruits. Since Lord Kåñëa's spiritual body had apparently grown slightly in age and strength, the senior men of Våndävana, headed by Nanda Mahäräja, decided to promote Kåñëa from the task of herding calves to the status of a regular cowherd boy. He would now take care of the full-grown cows, bulls and oxen. Out of great affection, Nanda Mahäräja had previously considered Kåñëa too small and immature to take care of full-grown cows and bulls. It is stated in the Kärttika-mähätmya section of the Padma Puräëa:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">çukläñöamé kärttike tu</div>

From that day, Lord Väsudeva served as a cowherd, whereas previously He had tended the calves." The word padaiù indicates that Lord Kåñëa blessed the earth by walking on her surface with His lotus feet. The Lord wore no shoes or other footgear but walked barefoot in the forest, giving great anxiety to the girls of Våndävana, who feared that His soft lotus feet would be injured.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé has explained the various meanings of the word mädhava as follows: Mädhava normally indicates Kåñëa to be "the Lord, who is the consort of the goddess of fortune, Lakñmé." This name also implies that Lord Kåñëa descended in the dynasty of Madhu. Since the spring season is also known as Mädhava, it is understood that as soon as Lord Kåñëa entered the Våndävana forest, it automatically exhibited all the opulences of spring, becoming filled with flowers, breezes and a celestial atmosphere. Another reason Lord Kåñëa is known as Mädhava is that He enjoys His pastimes in madhu, the taste of conjugal love.</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa would loudly sound His flute as He entered the forest of Çré Våndävana, thus giving inconceivable bliss to all the residents of His hometown, Vraja-dhäma. These simple pastimes of playfully entering the forest, playing on the flute and so forth were performed daily in the spiritual land of Våndävana.</div>

<div class="First"> The words mudä smayann iva indicate that Lord Kåñëa was in a joking mood. He knew that the trees were actually bowing down to worship Him. But in the following verse the Lord, speaking in a friendly, lighthearted mood, gives the credit to His brother, Balaräma.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: O greatest of Lords, just see how these trees are bowing their heads at Your lotus feet, which are worshipable by the immortal demigods. The trees are offering You their fruits and flowers to eradicate the dark ignorance that has caused their birth as trees.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The trees of Våndävana were thinking that because of past offenses they had now taken birth as trees and, being immovable, could not accompany Lord Kåñëa in His wanderings throughout the Våndävana area. In fact, all the creatures of Våndävana, including the trees and cows, were great souls who could personally associate with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But because of ecstatic sentiments of separation, the trees considered themselves in ignorance and thus tried to purify themselves by bowing down at the lotus feet of Kåñëa and Balaräma. Lord Kåñëa understanding their mentality, simultaneously glanced at them with affection and praised their devotional service before His older brother, Balaräma.</div>

<div class="Translation"> O original personality, these bees must all be great sages and most elevated devotees of Yours, for they are worshiping You by following You along the path and chanting Your glories, which are themselves a holy place for the entire world. Though You have disguised Yourself within this forest, O sinless one, they refuse to abandon You, their worshipable Lord.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word güòham is significant in this verse. It indicates that although the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form of Kåñëa or Balaräma appears like an ordinary human being within the material world, great sages always recognize the Lord as the Supreme Absolute Truth. All the transcendental forms of Godhead are eternal and full of bliss and knowledge, exactly the opposite of our material bodies, which are temporary and full of misery and ignorance.</div>
<div class="First"> One meaning of the word tértha is "the means for crossing beyond material existence." Simply by hearing the glories of the Supreme Lord or by chanting them, one immediately comes to the spiritual platform, beyond material existence. Thus the Lord's transcendental glories are here described as a tértha for everyone in the world. The word gäyantaù indicates that great sages give up their vows of silence and other selfish processes to glorify the activities of the Supreme Lord. Real silence means to not speak nonsense, to limit one's verbal activities to those sounds, statements and discussions relevant to the loving service of the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> The word anagha indicates that the Supreme Lord never performs sinful or offensive activities. The word also indicates that the Lord immediately excuses a sin or offense committed by a sincere loving devotee who may accidentally deviate from the Lord's service. In the specific context of this verse, the word anagha indicates that Lord Balaräma was not disturbed by the bees who were constantly following Him (anupatham). The Lord blessed them by saying, "O bees, come into My confidential grove and feel free to taste its fragrance."</div>

<div class="Translation"> This earth has now become most fortunate, because You have touched her grass and bushes with Your feet and her trees and creepers with Your fingernails, and because You have graced her rivers, mountains, birds and animals with Your merciful glances. But above all, You have embraced the young cowherd women between Your two arms-a favor hankered after by the goddess of fortune herself.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word adya, "now," indicates the time of Lord Balaräma and Lord Kåñëa's appearance on the earth. In His form of Varäha, Lord Kåñëa personally saved the earth, and, indeed, the earth is understood to rest perpetually on the potency of Çeña. Both Varäha and Çeña are expansions of Balaräma, who is Himself an expansion of Lord Kåñëa, the original Personality of Godhead. Lord Kåñëa's statement that "this earth has now become most fortunate" (dhanyeyam adya dharaëé) indicates that nothing can equal the blessings of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His personal form as Kåñëa, appearing simultaneously with His plenary expansion, Balaräma. The compound word karajäbhimåñöäù, "touched by Your fingernails," indicates that as Kåñëa and Balaräma would move through the forest They would pick fruits and flowers from the trees, bushes and creepers and use this paraphernalia in Their pleasure pastimes. Sometimes They would break leaves off the plants and use them with the flowers to decorate Their bodies.</div>
<div class="First"> Kåñëa and Balaräma would glance lovingly and mercifully at all the rivers, hills and creatures in Våndävana. But the blessing received by the gopés—being embraced directly between the Lord's arms—was the supreme benediction, desired even by the goddess of fortune herself. The goddess of fortune, who lives in Vaikuëöha on the chest of Lord Näräyaëa, once desired to be embraced on the chest of Çré Kåñëa, and thus she performed severe austerities to achieve this blessing. Çré Kåñëa informed her that her actual place was in Vaikuëöha and that it was not possible for her to dwell upon His chest in Våndävana. Therefore she begged Kåñëa to allow her to remain on His chest in the form of a golden line, and He granted her this benediction. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura recounts this incident from the Puräëas.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Sometimes the honeybees in Våndävana became so mad with ecstasy that they closed their eyes and began to sing. Lord Kåñëa, moving along the forest path with His cowherd boyfriends and Baladeva, would then respond to the bees by imitating their singing while His friends sang about His pastimes. Sometimes Lord Kåñëa would imitate the chattering of a parrot, sometimes, with a sweet voice, the call of a cuckoo, and sometimes the cooing of swans. Sometimes He vigorously imitated the dancing of a peacock, making His cowherd boyfriends laugh. Sometimes, with a voice as deep as the rumbling of clouds, He would call out with great affection the names of the animals who had wandered far from the herd, thus enchanting the cows and the cowherd boys.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé explains that Lord Kåñëa would joke with His friends, saying, "Just look, this peacock does not know how to dance properly," whereupon the Lord would vigorously imitate the peacock's dancing, causing great laughter among His friends. The bees in Våndävana would drink the sap of the forest flowers, and the combination of this nectar and the association of Çré Kåñëa made them mad with intoxication. Thus they closed their eyes in ecstasy and expressed their satisfaction by humming. And this humming was also expertly imitated by the Lord.</div>

<div class="First"> Although neither man nor bird nor beast could even approach the Täla forest, the cowherd boys had so much faith in Lord Kåñëa and Lord Balaräma that they took it for granted the two Lords could effortlessly kill the sinful ass demons and acquire the delicious täla fruits. Lord Kåñëa's cowherd boyfriends are exalted, self-realized souls who would not ordinarily become greedy for sweet fruits. In fact, they are simply joking with the Lord and enthusing His pastimes, urging Him to perform unprecedented heroic feats in the Täla forest. Innumerable demons disturbed the sublime atmosphere of Våndävana during Lord Kåñëa's presence there, and the Lord would kill such demons as a popular daily event.</div>
<div class="First"> Since Lord Kåñëa had already killed many demons, on this particular day He decided to give first honors to Lord Balaräma, who would demolish the first demon, Dhenuka.

One reason for this is that the demons, having seen the prowess of Lord Balaräma, thought it wise to attack Kåñëa first. Or it may be that out of affection for His elder brother, Lord Kåñëa placed Himself between Balaräma and the ass demons. The words kåñëaà ca rämaà ca may also be understood to indicate that Lord Balaräma, out of affection for His younger brother, went to Lord Kåñëa's side.</div>

<div class="First"> According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the bodies of the demons were dark, like dark blue clouds, and the large quantity of blood that had flowed from their bodies appeared like bright red clouds. Thus the whole scene was very beautiful. The Supreme Personality of Godhead in His various forms, such as Räma and Kåñëa, is always transcendental, and when He enacts His transcendental pastimes the result is always beautiful and transcendental, even when the Lord performs violent acts like killing the stubborn ass demons.</div>

Thus the gopés, although the most pure-hearted of all great souls, did not hesitate to come forward and satisfy their love-struck eyes by drinking in the sight of beautiful young Kåñëa.

<div class="Translation"> With their beelike eyes, the women of Våndävana drank the honey of the beautiful face of Lord Mukunda, and thus they gave up the distress they had felt during the day because of separation from Him. The young Våndävana ladies cast sidelong glances at the Lord—glances filled with bashfulness, laughter and submission—and Çré Kåñëa, completely accepting these glances as a proper offering of respect, entered the cowherd village.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çréla Prabhupäda describes this incident as follows: "All the gopés in Våndävana remained very morose on account of Kåñëa's absence. All day they were thinking of Kåñëa in the forest or of Him herding cows in the pasture. When they saw Kåñëa returning, all their anxieties were immediately relieved, and they began to look at His face the way drones hover over the honey of the lotus flower. When Kåñëa entered the village, the young gopés smiled and laughed. Kåñëa, while playing the flute, enjoyed the beautiful smiling faces of the gopés."</div>
<div class="First"> The Supreme Lord, Çré Kåñëa, is the supreme master of romantic skills, and thus He expertly exchanged loving feelings with the young cowherd girls of Våndävana. When a chaste young girl is in love, she glances at her beloved with shyness, jubilation and submission. When the beloved accepts her offering of love by receiving her glance and is thus satisfied with her, the loving young girl's heart becomes filled with happiness. These were exactly the romantic exchanges taking place between beautiful young Kåñëa and the loving cowherd girls of Våndävana.</div>

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Fifteenth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Killing of Dhenuka, the Ass Demon."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 16. Kåñëa Chastises the Serpent Käliya</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter describes Lord Çré Kåñëa's pastime of subduing the serpent Käliya within the lake adjoining the river Yamunä and His showing mercy to Käliya in response to the prayers offered by Käliya's wives, the Näga-patnés. To restore the purity of the Yamunä's waters, which had been contaminated by Käliya's poison, Lord Kåñëa climbed into a kadamba tree on the riverbank and jumped into the water. Then He began fearlessly playing within the water like a maddened elephant. Käliya could not tolerate Kåñëa's trespassing upon his personal residence, and the serpent quickly went up to the Lord and bit Him on the chest. When Kåñëa's friends saw this, they fell down on the ground unconscious. At that time all sorts of evil omens appeared in Vraja, such as earth tremors, falling stars and the trembling of various creatures' left limbs. The residents of Våndävana thought, "Today Kåñëa went to the forest without Balaräma, so we do not know what great misfortune may have befallen Him." Thinking in this way, they traced the path of Kåñëa's footprints to the bank of the Yamunä. Within the water of the lake adjoining the river they saw Lord Kåñëa, the very essence of their lives, enwrapped in the coils of a black snake. The residents thought the three worlds had become empty, and they all prepared to enter the water. But Lord Balaräma checked them, knowing well the power of Kåñëa.</div>
<div class="First"> Then Lord Kåñëa, seeing how disturbed His friends and relatives had become, expanded His body greatly and forced the serpent to loosen his grip and release Him. Next the Lord began playfully dancing about on the serpent's hoods. By this wonderful, boisterous dancing, Çré Kåñëa trampled the serpent's one thousand hoods until his body slackened. Vomiting blood from his mouths, Käliya finally understood that Kåñëa was the primeval personality, Lord Näräyaëa, the spiritual master of all moving and nonmoving creatures, and he took shelter of Him.</div>
<div class="First"> Seeing how very weary Käliya had become, his wives, the Näga-patnés, bowed down at Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet. Then they offered Him various prayers in hopes of gaining their husband's freedom: "It is quite fitting that You have brought our cruel husband to this condition. Indeed, by Your anger he has gained great benefit. What piety Käliya must have amassed in his previous lives! Today he has borne upon his head the dust of the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, the attainment of which is difficult for even the mother of the universe, goddess Lakñmé. Please kindly forgive the offense Käliya has committed out of ignorance, and allow him to live." Satisfied by the Näga-patnés' prayers, Kåñëa released Käliya, who slowly regained his sensory and vital powers. Then Käliya, in a distressed voice, acknowledged the offense he had committed, and finally he offered Kåñëa many prayers and said he was ready to accept His command.

<div class="First"> The question may arise as to why Kåñëa and Balaräma allowed Their loving devotees to suffer such great anguish during Kåñëa's temporary imprisonment within the coils of Käliya. It must be remembered that because the inhabitants of Våndävana were completely liberated souls, they did not experience material emotions. When they saw their beloved Kåñëa in apparent danger, their love for Him intensified to the highest degree, and thus they merged completely into the ecstasy of love for Him. The whole situation has to be seen from the spiritual point of view, or it will not be seen at all.</div>

Why hadn't His footprints been obliterated by those of the beasts and birds of Våndävana forest? The answer is indicated by the word viç-pati, master of the cowherd community. Since Lord Kåñëa is actually the wealth of all living beings, all the inhabitants of the forest of Vraja would carefully preserve His footprints as great treasures, the very ornaments of the earth. Thus no creature within Våndävana would ever walk upon Lord Kåñëa's footprints."</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear King Parékñit, Lord Kåñëa's wonderful, powerful dancing trampled and broke all of Käliya's one thousand hoods. Then the serpent, profusely vomiting blood from his mouths, finally recognized Çré Kåñëa to be the eternal Personality of Godhead, the supreme master of all moving and nonmoving beings, Çré Näräyaëa. Thus within his mind Käliya took shelter of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In Chapter Sixteen of Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çréla Prabhupäda points out that whereas previously Käliya was vomiting poison, now his poison was exhausted and he began to vomit blood. Thus he had been cleansed of the vile contamination within his heart that had manifested as serpent's venom. The word småtvä, "remembering," is very significant here. The wives of Käliya were actually serious devotees of Lord Kåñëa, and according to the äcäryas they had often tried to convince their husband to surrender to Him. Finally, finding himself in unbearable agony, Käliya remembered his wives' advice and took shelter of the Lord. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains that Käliya's archrival had traditionally been Garuòa, the carrier of Viñëu. But now Käliya realized that he was fighting an opponent who was thousands of times stronger than Garuòa and who therefore could be only the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus Käliya took shelter of Lord Kåñëa.</div>

<div class="Translation"> When Käliya's wives saw how the serpent had become so fatigued from the excessive weight of Lord Kåñëa, who carries the entire universe in His abdomen, and how Käliya's umbrellalike hoods had been shattered by the striking of Kåñëa's heels, they felt great distress. With their clothing, ornaments and hair scattered in disarray, they then approached the eternal Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, Käliya's wives had been disgusted with their husband because of his demoniac activities. They had been thinking, "If this atheist is killed by the punishment of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then let him be killed. We will become widows and engage in the worship of the Supreme Lord." But then the ladies noticed Käliya's facial expression and other bodily features, and they understood that Käliya had indeed taken shelter of the Lord within his mind. Seeing that he was manifesting symptoms of humility, remorse, regret and doubt, they thought, "Just see how fortunate we are! Our husband has now become a Vaiñëava. Therefore we must now endeavor to protect him." They felt affection for their repentant husband and severe distress because of his miserable position, and thus all together they went into the presence of the Supreme Lord.</div>

As Lord Caitanya advised in His Çikñäñöaka, one has to execute devotional service by humbly chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra, thinking oneself lower than the straw in the street and not expecting honor for oneself but offering all kinds of honor to others. The Näga-patnés were astonished that, although Käliya had the body of a serpent as the result of grievous sinful activities, at the same time he was in contact with the Lord to the extent that the Lord's lotus feet were touching his hoods. Certainly this was not the ordinary result of pious activities. These two contradictory facts astonished them."</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Obeisances to You, O Lord, who manifest varieties of material and spiritual qualities. You disguise Yourself with the material qualities, and yet the functioning of those same material qualities ultimately reveals Your existence. You stand apart from the material qualities as a witness and can be fully known only by Your devotees.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word guëa conveys various meanings: the three basic qualities of material nature, i.e., goodness, passion and ignorance; excellent qualities one manifests because of piety and spiritual achievement; or the internal senses, such as the mind and intelligence. The word pradépäya means "unto Him who manifests or illumines." Thus here the Näga-patnés are addressing the Supreme Lord as "He who manifests all material and spiritual qualities and who causes the living entities to be conscious." One can see the Lord by going beyond the screen of material nature, and therefore He is called guëätma-cchädanäya. If one methodically and intelligently studies the functioning of the material qualities, he will ultimately conclude that there is a Supreme Personality of Godhead and that He exhibits His illusory potency to bewilder those who do not surrender unto Him.</div>
<div class="First"> The Lord is never affected by the modes of nature, being their witness, and thus He is called guëa-drañöre. The word sva indicates "one's own," and thus sva-saàvide means that Lord Kåñëa can be known only by His own people, the devotees, and also that ultimately only the Lord can know Himself perfectly. Therefore we should take Lord Kåñëa's instructions in Bhagavad-gétä and immediately come to the right conclusion: full surrender to the Lord's lotus feet. Thus we should humbly glorify the Lord, following the example of the Näga-patnés.</div>

<div class="Translation"> O almighty Lord, although You have no reason to become involved in material activity, still You act through Your eternal potency of time to arrange for the creation, maintenance and destruction of this universe.

Here the Näga-patnés point out that the Lord's pastimes are amogha, beyond any discrepancy. Çré Kåñëa actually desires that all conditioned souls live with Him in His eternal kingdom, but those forgetful souls who are inimical to their loving relationship with God must go to the material world and be subjected to the conditions of time. The fortunate conditioned souls are startled into remembrance of their actual position as loving servants of the Lord, and from within the heart the Lord then encourages them to come back home, back to Godhead, where time is conspicuous by its absence and where eternal, blissful existence supersedes the dramatic but disturbing functions of cosmic creation and annihilation.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Käliya worshiped the Lord of the universe by offering Him fine garments, along with necklaces, jewels and other valuable ornaments, wonderful scents and ointments, and a large garland of lotus flowers. Having thus pleased the Lord, whose flag is marked with the emblem of Garuòa, Käliya felt satisfied. Receiving the Lord's permission to leave, Käliya circumambulated Him and offered Him obeisances. Then, taking his wives, friends and children, he went to his island in the sea. The very moment Käliya left, the Yamunä was immediately restored to her original condition, free from poison and full of nectarean water. This happened by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who was manifesting a humanlike form to enjoy His pastimes.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has commented extensively on this verse. To explain the word maëibhiù—"(Käliya worshiped the Lord) with jewels"—the äcärya has quoted from the Çré Rädhä-kåñëa-gaëoddeça-dépikä, by Rüpa Gosvämé, as follows:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kaustubhäkhyo maëir yena</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">praviçya hradam auragam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">käliya-preyasi-våndahastair</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ätmopahäritaù</div>
<div class="First"> "The Lord had made His Kaustubha gem enter the serpent's lake, and then He arranged for it to be presented to Himself by the hands of Käliya's wives." In other words, because Lord Kåñëa wanted to act just like an ordinary human being, He made the transcendental Kaustubha gem invisible and caused it to enter within Käliya's treasury. Then when the appropriate moment came for Käliya to worship the Lord with many different jewels and ornaments, the serpent's wives, unaware of the Lord's transcendental trick, presented Him with the Kaustubha gem, thinking it was simply one of the jewels in their possession.</div>
<div class="First"> The äcärya has further commented that the reason Lord Kåñëa is described in this verse as garuòa-dhvaja, "He whose flag is marked by the symbol of His carrier, Garuòa," is that Käliya also desired to become Lord Kåñëa's carrier. Garuòa and the serpents are originally related as brothers, and therefore Käliya wanted to indicate to Lord Kåñëa, "If You ever have to go to a distant place, You should also think of me as Your personal carrier. I am the servant of Your servant, and in the wink of an eye I can travel hundreds of millions of yojanas." Thus the Puräëas narrate that in the course of Lord Kåñëa's eternal cycle of pastimes, when Kaàsa orders the Lord to come to Mathurä, He sometimes goes there mounted upon Käliya.</div>
<div class="First"> Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Sixteenth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Kåñëa Chastises the Serpent Käliya."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 17. The History of Käliya</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter describes how Käliya left the island of the snakes and how the sleeping residents of Våndävana were saved from a forest fire. When King Parékñit inquired about Käliya's leaving Ramaëaka Island, the abode of the serpents, and about why Garuòa acted inimically toward him, Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé replied as follows: All the serpents on the island were afraid of being devoured by Garuòa. To placate him, every month they would leave various offerings for him at the foot of a banyan tree. But Käliya, puffed-up as he was with false pride, would eat these offerings himself. Hearing of this, Garuòa became furious and went to kill Käliya, whereupon the snake began biting the great bird. Garuòa fiercely beat him with his wing, sending Käliya fleeing for his life to a lake adjoining the Yamunä River. Prior to the above incident, Garuòa had once come to the Yamunä and started eating some fish. Saubhari Åñi had tried to stop him, but Garuòa, agitated by hunger, had refused to heed the sage's prohibitions, and in response the sage had cursed Garuòa that if he ever came there again he would immediately die. Käliya had heard of this, and thus he lived there without fear. In the end, however, he was driven out by Çré Kåñëa.</div>
<div class="First"> When Lord Balaräma and all the residents of Våndävana saw Çré Kåñëa rise up out of the lake, beautifully decorated with many different gems and ornaments, they embraced Him in great pleasure. The spiritual masters, priests and learned brähmaëas then told Nanda Mahäräja, the king of the cowherds, that although his son had been caught in the grips of Käliya, it was by the king's good fortune that He was now free again.</div>
<div class="First"> Because the people of Våndävana were quite worn out by hunger, thirst and fatigue, they spent that night on the banks of the Yamunä. In the middle of the night, a fire happened to blaze up within the forest, which had become dry during the hot season. As the fire surrounded the sleeping inhabitants of Våndävana, they suddenly awoke and rushed to Çré Kåñëa for protection. Then the unlimitedly powerful Lord Çré Kåñëa, seeing His dear relatives and friends so distressed, immediately swallowed up the terrible forest fire.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Çukadeva Gosvämé said: To avoid being eaten by Garuòa, the serpents had previously made an arrangement with him whereby they would each make a monthly offering of tribute at the base of a tree. Thus every month on schedule, O mighty-armed King Parékñit, each serpent would duly make his offering to that powerful carrier of Viñëu as a purchase of protection.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has given an alternate explanation of this verse. Upahäryaiù may also be translated as "by those who are to be eaten," and sarpa-janaiù as "those human beings who were dominated by or who belonged to the serpent race." According to this reading, a group of human beings had fallen under the control of the serpents and were prone to be eaten by them. To avoid this, the human beings would make a monthly offering to the serpents, who in turn would offer a portion of that offering to Garuòa so that he would not eat them. The particular translation given above is based on the commentary of Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé and the translation by Çréla Prabhupäda in his Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In any case, all the äcäryas agree that the serpents purchased protection from Garuòa.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Seeing how the unfortunate fish in that lake had become most unhappy at the death of their leader, Saubhari uttered the following curse under the impression that he was mercifully acting for the benefit of the lake's residents.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In this regard Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains that when our so-called compassion does not tally with the order of the Supreme Lord, it merely causes a disturbance. Because Saubhari had forbidden Garuòa's coming to that lake, Käliya moved in and made his headquarters there, and this spelled doom for all the lake's residents.</div>

<div class="Translation"> If Garuòa ever again enters this lake and eats the fish here, he will immediately lose his life. What I am saying is the truth.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The äcäryas explain in this regard that because of Saubhari Muni's material attachment and affection for a fish, he failed to see the situation from the spiritual viewpoint. The Ninth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam describes his falldown for this offense. Because of false pride, Saubhari Muni lost his power of austerity, and with it his spiritual beauty and happiness. When Garuòa came to the Yamunä, Saubhari Muni thought, "Although he may be a personal associate of the Supreme Lord, I will still curse him and even kill him if he disobeys my order." Such an offensive attitude against an exalted Vaiñëava will certainly destroy one's auspicious position in life.</div>
<div class="First"> As the Ninth Canto describes, Saubhari Muni married many beautiful women, and suffered greatly in their association. But because he had once become glorious by taking shelter of the Yamunä River in Çré Våndävana, he was ultimately delivered.</div>

The residents of Våndävana took shelter of Kåñëa, thinking, "This blessed boy will certainly be empowered by God to save us." They remembered the words of the sage Garga Muni, spoken at the birth ceremony of Lord Kåñëa: anena sarva-durgäëi yüyam aïjas tariñyatha. "By His power you will easily be able to cross over all obstacles." (SB 10.8.16) Therefore the residents of Våndävana, who had full faith in Kåñëa, took shelter of the Lord in hopes of being saved from the impending disaster threatened by the forest fire.</div>

<div class="Chapnum"> 18. Lord Balaräma Slays the Demon Pralamba</div>
<div class="First"> The killing of Pralambäsura is described in this chapter. While playing happily in Våndävana, Lord Baladeva climbed up on the shoulders of the demon Pralamba and struck his head with His fist, destroying him. Çré Våndävana, where Kåñëa and Balaräma enacted Their pastimes, was even during the summer decorated with all the qualities of spring. At that time Lord Çré Kåñëa would become absorbed in various sports, surrounded by Balaräma and all the cowherd boys. One day they were intently dancing, singing and playing when a demon named Pralamba entered their midst, disguised as a cowherd boy. The omniscient Lord Kåñëa saw through the disguise, but even as He thought of how to kill the demon, He treated him as a friend.</div>
<div class="First"> Kåñëa then suggested to His young friends and Baladeva that they play a game involving contending parties. Taking the role of leaders, Kåñëa and Balaräma divided the boys into two groups and determined that the losers would have to carry the winners on their shoulders. Thus when Çrédämä and Våñabha, members of Balaräma's party, were victorious, Kåñëa and another boy in His party carried them on their shoulders. Pralambäsura thought that the unconquerable Lord Çré Kåñëa would be too great an opponent to contend with, so the demon fought with Balaräma instead and was defeated. Taking Lord Balaräma on his back, Pralambäsura began to walk away very swiftly. But Balaräma became as heavy as Mount Sumeru, and the demon, unable to carry Him, had to reveal his true, demoniac form. When Balaräma saw this terrible form, He struck the demon a ferocious blow on the head with His fist. This blow shattered Pralambäsura's head just as lightning bolts hurled by the king of the demigods shatter mountains. The demon repeatedly vomited blood and then fell upon the ground. When the cowherd boys saw Lord Balaräma return, they joyfully embraced and congratulated Him as the demigods showered garlands of flowers from the heavens and glorified Him.</div>

Äsphoöana means that sometimes they would slap one another's shoulders or backs, and vikarñaëaiù indicates they would drag one another about in the midst of their play.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé explains that the word ädyaiù, "by other such sports," indicates such games as chasing one another and building bridges. Another pastime would occur at noon, while Lord Kåñëa was taking rest. Nearby, the young cowherd girls would be passing by, singing, and Kåñëa's boyfriends would pretend to inquire from them about the price of milk. Then the boys would steal yogurt and other items from them and run away. Kåñëa, Balaräma and Their friends would also play games in which they would cross the river in boats.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura further explains that the boys would play with fruits by throwing a few in the air and then throwing others to try to hit them. The word netra-bandha indicates a game in which one boy would approach a blindfolded boy from behind and place his palms over the blindfolded boy's eyes. Then, simply by the feel of his palms, the blindfolded boy would have to guess who the other boy was. In all such games the boys put up stakes for the winner, such as flutes or walking sticks. Sometimes the boys would imitate the various fighting methods of the forest animals, and at other times they would chirp like birds.</div>

At times the cowherd boys would assemble in this area and prevent the young girls of Våndävana from crossing the river, insisting that they had to pay a customs duty first. Such activities were full of joking and laughter.</div>

Also because the demon had appeared as a cowherd boyfriend of Kåñëa's and because Kåñëa had accepted him as a friend, Baladeva was slightly apprehensive about killing him. Balaräma could also have been worried that since this cowherd boy was actually a demon in disguise, at that very moment another such demon might have been attacking Lord Kåñëa Himself. Thus the omniscient and omnipotent Supreme Lord Balaräma exhibited the pastime of becoming slightly nervous in the presence of the horrible demon Pralamba.</div>

<div class="Chapnum"> 19. Swallowing the Forest Fire</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter describes how Lord Kåñëa saved the cows and the cowherd boys from a great fire in the Muïjäraëya forest.</div>
<div class="First"> One day the cowherd boys became absorbed in sporting and allowed the cows to wander into a dense forest. Suddenly a forest fire blazed up, and to escape its flames the cows took refuge in a grove of sharp canes. When the cowherd boys missed their animals, they went searching for them, following their hoofprints and the trail of blades of grass and other plants they had trampled or had broken with their teeth. Finally the boys found the cows and removed them from the cane forest, but by that time the forest fire had grown strong and was threatening both the boys and the cows. Thus the cowherd boys took shelter of Çré Kåñëa, the master of all mystic power, who told them to close their eyes. They did so, and in a moment He had swallowed up the fierce forest fire and brought them all back to the Bhäëòéra tree mentioned in the last chapter. Seeing this wonderful display of mystic potency, the cowherd boys thought Kåñëa must be a demigod, and they began to praise Him. Then they all returned home.</div>

To increase their ecstasy, Kåñëa displayed to them His mystic potency and saved them from a terrible forest fire. The cowherd boys could never give up their ecstatic loving friendship with Kåñëa. Therefore, rather than considering Kåñëa to be God, after they saw His extraordinary power they thought that perhaps He was a demigod. But since Lord Kåñëa was their beloved friend, they were on the same level with Him, and thus they thought that they too must be demigods. In this way Kåñëa's cowherd friends became overwhelmed with ecstasy.</div>

<div class="First"> The äcäryas compare the sun's evaporating the earth's wealth of water to a king's collecting taxes. In Chapter Twenty, of Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çréla Prabhupäda explains this analogy as follows: "Clouds are accumulated water drawn from the land by the sunshine. Continually for eight months the sun evaporates all kinds of water from the surface of the globe, and this water is accumulated in the shape of clouds, which are distributed as water when there is need. Similarly, a government exacts various taxes from the citizens, such as income tax and sales tax, which the citizens are able to pay by their different material activities: agriculture, trade, industry and so on. This taxation is compared to the sun's drawing water from the earth. When there is again need of water on the surface of the globe, the same sunshine converts the water into clouds and distributes it all over the globe. Similarly, the taxes collected by the government must be distributed to the people again, as educational work, public work, sanitation work and so on. This is very essential for a good government. The government should not simply exact taxes for useless squandering; the tax collection should be utilized for the public welfare of the state."</div>

<div class="Translation"> Flashing with lightning, great clouds were shaken and swept about by fierce winds. Just like merciful persons, the clouds gave their lives for the pleasure of this world.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Just as great, compassionate personalities sometimes give their lives or wealth for the happiness of society, the rain clouds poured down their rain upon the parched earth. Although the clouds were thus dissipated, they freely provided rainfall for the happiness of the earth.</div>
<div class="First"> In Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çréla Prabhupäda comments as follows on this verse: "During the rainy season, there are strong winds blustering all over the country and carrying clouds from one place to another to distribute water. When water is urgently needed after the summer season, the clouds are just like a rich man who, in times of need, distributes his money even by exhausting his whole treasury. So the clouds exhaust themselves by distributing water all over the surface of the globe. "Then Mahäräja Daçaratha, the father of Lord Rämacandra, used to fight with his enemies, it was said that he approached them just like a farmer uprooting unnecessary plants and trees. And when there was need of giving charity, he used to distribute money exactly as the cloud distributes rain. The distribution of rain by clouds is so sumptuous that it is compared to the distribution of wealth by a great, munificent person. The clouds' downpour is so sufficient that the rains even fall on rocks and hills and on the oceans and seas, where there is no need for water. A cloud is like a charitable person who opens his treasury for distribution and does not discriminate whether the charity is needed or not. He gives in charity openhandedly." Metaphorically speaking, the lightning in rain clouds is the light by which they see the distressed condition of the earth, and the blowing winds are their heavy breathing, such as that found in a distressed person. Distressed to see the condition of the earth, the clouds tremble in the wind like a compassionate person. Thus they pour down their rain.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The earth had been emaciated by the summer heat, but she became fully nourished again when moistened by the god of rain.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çréla Prabhupäda comments on this verse as follows: "Before the rainfall, the whole surface of the globe becomes almost depleted of all kinds of energies and appears very lean. After the rainfall, the whole surface of the earth becomes green with vegetation and appears very healthy and strong. Here, a comparison is made to the person undergoing austerities for fulfillment of a material desire. The flourishing condition of the earth after a rainy season is compared to the fulfillment of material desires. Sometimes, when a country is subjugated by an undesirable government, persons and parties undergo severe penances and austerities to get control of the government, and when they attain control they flourish by giving themselves generous salaries. This also is like the flourishing of the earth in the rainy season. Actually, one should undergo severe austerities and penances only to achieve spiritual happiness. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is recommended that tapasya, or austerities, should be accepted only for realizing the Supreme Lord. By accepting austerity in devotional service, one regains his spiritual life, and as soon as one regains his spiritual life, he enjoys unlimited spiritual bliss. But if someone undertakes austerities and penances for some material gain, then, as stated in the Bhagavad-gétä, the results are temporary and are desired only by persons of less intelligence.

<div class="First"> Çréla Prabhupäda comments as follows: "During the rainy season, in the evening there are many glowworms visible about the tops of trees, hither and thither, and they glitter just like lights. But the luminaries of the sky, the stars and the moon, are not visible. Similarly, in the age of Kali, persons who are atheists or miscreants become very prominently visible, whereas persons who are actually following the Vedic principles for spiritual emancipation are practically obscured. This age, Kali-yuga, is compared to the cloudy season of the living entities. In this age, real knowledge is covered by the influence of the material advancement of civilization. The cheap mental speculators, atheists and manufacturers of so-called religious principles become prominent like the glowworms, whereas persons strictly following the Vedic principles, or scriptural injunctions, become covered by the clouds of this age. "People should learn to take advantage of the actual luminaries of the sky—the sun, moon and stars—instead of the glowworms' light. Actually, the glowworms cannot give any light in the darkness of night. As clouds sometimes clear, even in the rainy season, and the moon, stars and sun become visible, so even in this Kali-yuga there are sometimes advantages. The Vedic movement of Lord Caitanya—the distribution of the chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mantra—is understood in this way. People seriously anxious to find real life should take advantage of this movement instead of looking toward the so-called light of mental speculators and atheists."</div>

The poet Vidyäpati said that in the society of friends, family, children, wife and so on, there is certainly some pleasure, but that pleasure is compared to a drop of water in the desert. Everyone is hankering after happiness, just as in the desert everyone is hankering after water. If in the desert there is a drop of water, the water is there, of course, but the benefit from that drop of water is very insignificant. In our materialistic way of life, we are hankering after an ocean of happiness, but in the form of society, friends and mundane love we are getting no more than a drop of water. Our satisfaction is never achieved, as the small rivulets, lakes and ponds are never filled with water in the dry season."</div>

<div class="First"> It is common for people living in large cities to become miserable and disgusted when there is ample rainfall.

<div class="First"> Modern, sophisticated people often look down their noses at those engaged in agricultural work. In fact, in American slang, a simple, unintelligent person is sometimes called "a farmer." There are also government agencies that restrict agricultural production because certain capitalists fear the effect on market prices. Because of various artificial and manipulative practices in modern governments, we find widespread food shortages throughout the world—even in the United States, among the poverty-stricken—and at the same time we find the governments paying farmers not to plant crops. Sometimes these governments throw huge amounts of food into the ocean. Thus the administration of the arrogant and ignorant, those who are too proud to obey the laws of God or too ignorant to recognize them, will always cause frustration among the people, whereas a God conscious government will provide abundance and happiness for all.</div>

A cloud is compared to a qualified person because it pours rain and gives sustenance to many people; a man who is qualified similarly gives sustenance to many living creatures, such as family members or many workers in business. Unfortunately, his whole life can be disturbed by a wife who divorces him; when the husband is disturbed, the whole family is ruined, the children are dispersed or the business is closed, and everything is affected. It is therefore recommended that a woman desiring to advance in Kåñëa consciousness peacefully live with a husband and that the couple not separate under any condition. The husband and wife should control sex indulgence and concentrate their minds on Kåñëa consciousness so their life may be successful. After all, in the material world a man requires a woman, and a woman requires a man.

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> During the rainy season the moon was prevented from appearing directly by the covering of the clouds, which were themselves illumined by the moon's rays. Similarly, the living being in material existence is prevented from appearing directly by the covering of the false ego, which is itself illumined by the consciousness of the pure soul.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The analogy given here is excellent. During the rainy season we cannot see the moon in the sky, because the moon is covered by clouds. These clouds, however, are radiant with the glow of the moon's own rays. Similarly, in our conditioned, material existence we cannot directly perceive the soul, because our consciousness is covered by the false ego, which is the false identification with the material world and the material body. Yet it is the soul's own consciousness that illumines the false ego.</div>
<div class="First"> As the Gétä describes, the energy of the soul is consciousness, and when this consciousness manifests through the screen of false ego, it appears as dull, material consciousness, in which there is no direct vision of the soul or God. In the material world, even great philosophers ultimately resort to hazy ambiguities when speaking about the Absolute Truth, just as the cloudy sky manifests only in a dull and indirect way the iridescent light of the moon. In material life, our false ego is often enthusiastic, hopeful and apparently aware of various material affairs, and such consciousness encourages us to push on in material existence. But in truth we are merely experiencing the dull reflection of our original, pure consciousness, which is Kåñëa consciousness—direct perception of the soul and God. Not realizing that the false ego merely hampers and dulls our real, spiritual consciousness, which is fully enlightened and blissful, we mistakenly think that material consciousness is full of knowledge and happiness. This is comparable to thinking that the luminous clouds are lighting up the night sky, while in fact it is the moonshine that illumines the sky, and the clouds that merely dull and hamper the moonshine. The clouds appear luminous because they are filtering and impeding the brilliant rays of the moon. Similarly, at times material consciousness appears pleasurable or enlightened because it is screening or filtering the original, blissful and enlightened consciousness coming directly from the soul. If we can understand the ingenious analogy given in this verse, we can easily advance in Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The trees had grown thin and dry, but after they drank the newly fallen rainwater through their feet, their various bodily features blossomed.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word päda means foot, and pä means drinking. Trees are called pädapa because they drink through their roots, which are likened to feet. Upon drinking the newly fallen rainwater, the trees in Våndävana began to manifest new leaves, sprouts and blossoms, and they thus enjoyed new growth. Similarly, materialistic persons often perform severe austerities to acquire the object of their desire. For example, politicians in America undergo grueling austerities while traveling about the countryside campaigning for election. Businessmen also will often deny personal comfort to make their business successful. Such austere persons, upon acquiring the fruits of their austerity, again become healthy and satisfied, like trees eagerly drinking rainwater after enduring the austerity of a dry, hot summer.</div>

<div class="First"> During the rainy season there are often mud slides around the shores of lakes, and thorny hushes, stones and other debris sometimes accumulate there.

<div class="Translation"> Autumn cleared the sky of clouds, let the animals get out of their crowded living conditions, cleaned the earth of its covering of mud, and purified the water of contamination, in the same way that loving service rendered to Lord Kåñëa frees the members of the four spiritual orders from their respective troubles.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Every human being must perform the prescribed duties corresponding to one of the four spiritual orders of life. These divisions are 1) celibate student life, brahmacarya; 2) married life, gåhastha; 3) retired life, vänaprastha; and 4) renounced life, sannyäsa. A brahmacäré must perform many menial duties during his student life, but as he becomes advanced in loving service to Kåñëa, his superiors recognize his spiritual status and elevate him to higher duties. The innumerable obligations performed on behalf of wife and children constantly harass a householder, but as he becomes advanced in loving service to Kåñëa, he is automatically elevated by the laws of nature to more enjoyable, spiritual occupations, and he somehow minimizes material duties. Those in the vänaprastha, or retired, order of life also perform many duties, and these can also be replaced by ecstatic loving service to Kåñëa. Similarly, renounced life has many natural difficulties, not the least of which is that sannyäsés, or renounced men, are inclined to meditate on the impersonal aspect of the Absolute Truth. As stated in the Bhagavad-gétä (12.5), kleço 'dhikataras teñäm avyaktäsakta-cetasäm: "For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Lord, advancement is exceedingly painful." But as soon as a sannyäsé takes to preaching the glories of Kåñëa in every town and village, his life becomes a blissful sequence of beautiful spiritual realizations.</div>
<div class="First"> In the autumn season the sky returns to its natural blue color. The vanishing of the clouds is like the vanishing of troublesome duties in brahmacäré life. Just after summer comes the rainy season, when the animals sometimes become disturbed by the torrential storms and thus huddle together. But the autumn season signals the time for the animals to go to their respective areas and live more peacefully. This represents a householder's becoming free from the harassment of family duties and being able to devote more of his time to spiritual responsibilities, which are the real goal of life both for himself and his family. The removal of the muddy layer on the earth is like the removal of the inconveniences of vänaprastha life, and the purification of the water is like the sanctification of sannyäsa life by one's preaching the glories of Kåñëa without sex desire.</div>

But when the clouds pour down their rain, they become white and then brilliantly reflect the shining sun, just as a man who gives up all material desires and sinful propensities becomes purified and then brilliantly reflects his own soul and the Supreme Soul within.</div>

<div class="Translation"> During this season the mountains sometimes released their pure water and sometimes did not, just as experts in transcendental science sometimes give the nectar of transcendental knowledge and sometimes do not.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The first part of this chapter described the rainy season, and the second part has been dealing with the autumn season, which begins when the rain stops. During the rainy season water always flows from the mountains, but during the autumn the water sometimes flows and sometimes does not. Similarly, great saintly teachers sometimes speak expansively on spiritual knowledge, and sometimes they are silent. The self-realized soul is closely in touch with the Supreme Soul, and according to His desires a competent spiritual scientist may or may not describe the Absolute Truth, depending on the specific circumstances.</div>

<div class="First"> After the rainy season the water gradually goes down, but stupid fish do not understand this; thus they are often stranded on the lakeshores and riverbanks.

<div class="First"> Çréla Prabhupäda comments, "In autumn, farmers save the water within the fields by building strong walls so that the water contained within the field cannot run out. There is hardly any hope for new rainfall; therefore they want to save whatever is in the field. Similarly, a person who is actually advanced in self-realization protects his energy by controlling the senses. It is advised that after the age of fifty, one should retire from family life and conserve the energy of the body for utilization in the advancement of Kåñëa consciousness. Unless one is able to control the senses and engage them in the transcendental loving service of Mukunda, there is no possibility of salvation."</div>

<div class="First"> Çréla Prabhupäda comments, "In Våndävana the autumn season was very beautiful then because of the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa and Balaräma. The mercantile community, the royal order and the great sages were free to move to achieve their desired benedictions. Similarly, the transcendentalists, when freed from the encagement of the material body, also achieved their desired goal. During the rainy season, the mercantile community cannot move from one place to another and so do not get their desired profit. Nor can the royal order go from one place to another to collect taxes from the people. As for saintly persons who must travel to preach transcendental knowledge, they also are restrained by the rainy season. But during the autumn, all of them leave their confines. In the case of the transcendentalist, be he a jïäné, a yogé or a devotee, because of the material body he cannot actually enjoy spiritual achievement. But as soon as he gives up the body, or after death, the jïäné merges into the spiritual effulgence of the Supreme Lord, the yogé transfers himself to the various higher planets, and the devotee goes to the planet of the Supreme Lord, Goloka Våndävana, or the Vaikuëöhas, and thus enjoys his eternal spiritual life." Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A . C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Twentieth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Rainy Season and Autumn in Våndävana."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 21. The Gopés Glorify the Song of Kåñëa's Flute</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter describes how Lord Çré Kåñëa entered the enchanting forest of Våndävana upon the arrival of autumn, and the praises the young cowherd girls sang when they heard the vibration of His flute. As Lord Kåñëa, Lord Balaräma and Their cowherd friends entered the forest to graze the cows, Kåñëa began playing His flute. The gopés heard the enchanting flute-song and understood that Kåñëa was entering the forest. Then they narrated to each other the Lord's various activities. The gopés declared, "To see Lord Kåñëa playing His flute while taking the cows to pasture is the highest perfection for the eyes. What pious activities has this flute performed that enable him to freely drink the nectar of Çré Kåñëa's lips-a blessing we cowherd girls find difficult to achieve? Hearing the song of Kåñëa's flute, the peacocks dance, and all the other creatures become stunned when they see them. Demigoddesses traveling through the sky in their airplanes are vexed by Cupid, and their garments become loose. The ears of the cows stand on end as they drink the nectar of this flute-song, and their calves simply stand stunned, the milk they have been drinking from their mothers' udders still in their mouths. The birds take shelter of the branches of the trees and close their eyes, listening to the song of Kåñëa's flute with rapt attention. The flowing rivers become perturbed by conjugal attraction for Kåñëa and, stopping their flow, embrace Kåñëa's lotus feet with the arms of their waves, while the clouds serve as parasols to shade Kåñëa's head from the hot sun. The aborigine women of the Çabara race, seeing the grass stained by the red kuìkuma adorning the Lord's lotus feet, smear this vermilion powder upon their breasts and faces to alleviate the distress created by Cupid. Govardhana Hill offers grass and various kinds of fruits and bulbous roots in worship of Lord Çré Kåñëa. All the nonmoving living beings take on the characteristics of moving creatures, and the moving living beings become stationary. These things are all very wonderful."</div>

The peacocks dance madly when they hear Govinda's flute, and when other creatures see them from the hilltops, they all become stunned.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Çrédhara Svämé explains that because activities such as those described in this verse do not occur in any other world, the earth is unique. In fact, the earth's glories are being spread by wonderful Våndävana because it is the place of Kåñëa's pastimes.</div>
<div class="First"> The name Devaké also refers to mother Yaçodä, as stated in the Båhad-viñëu Puräëa:</div>

<div class="First"> "The wife of Nanda had two names, Yaçodä and also Devaké. Therefore it was natural that she [the wife of Nanda] develop friendship with Devaké, the wife of Çauri [Vasudeva]."</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains kåñëa-lélä as follows: "In Våndävana, the peacocks request Kåñëa, 'Govinda, please make us dance.' Thus Kåñëa plays His flute, and they surround Him in a circle and dance in time with the rhythm of His melody. And while standing in the midst of their dancing, He also sings and dances. Then those peacocks, who are fully satisfied with His musical performance, out of gratitude offer for His pleasure their own divine feathers. In the usual manner of musical performers, Kåñëa gladly accepts these presentations and places a feather upon the turban atop His head. Gentle animals such as deer and doves greatly relish the transcendental entertainment presented by Kåñëa, and to get a good view they flock to the peaks of hills. Then, as they watch the breathtaking program, they become stunned in ecstasy."</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé comments that because in Våndävana Kåñëa goes barefoot and can thus directly mark the earth with the symbols of His lotus feet, that transcendental land is even more glorious than Vaikuëöha, where Viñëu wears slippers.</div>

Indeed, they become joyful upon seeing how their wives are searching after Kåñëa, and, following along, they urge their wives to go to the Lord.

<div class="Translation"> Kåñëa's beauty and character create a festival for all women. Indeed, when the demigods' wives flying in airplanes with their husbands catch sight of Him and hear His resonant flute-song, their hearts are shaken by Cupid, and they become so bewildered that the flowers fall out of their hair and their belts loosen.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çréla Prabhupäda comments: "[This verse indicates] that the transcendental sound of the flute of Kåñëa extended to all corners of the universe. Also, it is significant that the gopés knew about the different kinds of airplanes flying in the sky." In fact, even while sitting on the laps of their demigod husbands, the demigoddesses became agitated by hearing the sounds of Kåñëa's flute. Thus the gopés thought that they themselves should not be blamed for their ecstatic conjugal attraction for Kåñëa, who after all was a cowherd boy from their own village and thus a natural object of their love. If even demigoddesses became mad after Kåñëa, how could poor, earthly cowherd girls from Kåñëa's own village avoid having their hearts completely conquered by His loving glances and the sounds of His flute?</div>
<div class="First"> The gopés also considered that the demigods, although noting their wives' attraction to Kåñëa, did not become envious. The demigods are actually very refined in culture and intelligence, and therefore when flying in their airplanes they regularly take their wives along to see Kåñëa. The gopés thought, "Our husbands, on the other hand, are envious. Therefore even the inferior deer are better off than we, and the demigoddesses are also very fortunate, whereas we poor human beings in an intermediate position are most unfortunate."</div>

<div class="First"> The word rucira-pravälän indicates that even the branches of the trees are transformed in ecstasy when struck by the vibration of Kåñëa's flute-song. Indra, Brahmä, Çiva and Viñëu, being primordial gods, travel throughout the universe and have extensive knowledge of the science of music, and yet even these great personalities have never heard or composed music like that which emanates from Kåñëa's flute. Indeed, the birds are so moved by the blissful sound that in their ecstasy they close their eyes and cling to the branches to avoid falling off the trees.</div>

The aborigine girls had very full breasts, and they were also very lusty, but when their lovers felt their breasts, they were not very satisfied. When they came out into the midst of the forest, they saw that while Kåñëa was walking, some of the leaves and creepers of Våndävana turned reddish from the kuìkuma powder that fell from His lotus feet. His lotus feet were held by the gopés on their breasts, which were also smeared with kuìkuma powder, but when Kåñëa traveled in the Våndävana forest with Balaräma and His boyfriends, the reddish powder fell on the ground of the Våndävana forest. So the lusty aborigine girls, while looking toward Kåñëa playing His flute, saw the reddish kuìkuma on the ground and immediately took it and smeared it over their faces and breasts.

Govardhana also offers other beverages, such as honey, mango juice and pélu juice. Süyavasa indicates dürvä grass, used to make the religious offering of arghya. Govardhana also has grass that is fragrant, soft and conducive to the strong growth of cows and increased production of milk. Thus this grass is used for feeding the transcendental herds. Kandara refers to the caves where Kåñëa, Balaräma and Their friends play, sit and lie down. These caves give pleasure when the weather is too hot or too cold, or when it is raining. Govardhana also features soft roots for eating, jewels for ornamenting the body, flat places for sitting, and lamps and mirrors in the form of smooth stones, glistening water and other natural substances.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In this regard Çréla Prabhupäda comments, "This is the perfect example of Kåñëa consciousness: to somehow or other remain always engrossed in thoughts of Kåñëa. The vivid example is always present in the behavior of the gopés; therefore Lord Caitanya declared that no one can worship the Supreme Lord by any method that is better than the method of the gopés. The gopés were not born in very high brähmaëa or kñatriya families; they were born in the families of vaiçyas, and not in big mercantile communities but in the families of cowherd men. They were not very well educated, although they heard all sorts of knowledge from the brähmaëas, the authorities of Vedic knowledge. The gopés' only purpose was to remain always absorbed in thoughts of Kåñëa." Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A . C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Twenty-first Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Gopés Glorify the Song of Kåñëa's Flute."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 22. Kåñëa Steals the Garments of the Unmarried Gopés</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter describes how the marriageable daughters of the cowherd men worshiped Kätyäyané to get Lord Çré Kåñëa as their husband, and how Kåñëa stole the garments of the young girls and gave the girls benedictions. During the month of Märgaçérña, every day early in the morning the young daughters of the cowherds would take one another's hands and, singing of Kåñëa's transcendental qualities, go to the Yamunä to bathe. Desiring to obtain Kåñëa as their husband, they would then worship the goddess Kätyäyané with incense, flowers and other items.</div>
<div class="First"> One day, the young gopés left their garments on the shore as usual and began playing in the water while chanting of Lord Kåñëa's activities. Suddenly Kåñëa Himself came there, took away all the garments and climbed a nearby kadamba tree. Wanting to tease the gopés, Kåñëa said, "I understand how fatigued you gopés are from your austerities, so please come onto the shore and take back your clothes."</div>
<div class="First"> The gopés then pretended to become angry and said the cold water of the Yamunä was giving them great pain. If Kåñëa did not give them back their garments, they said, they would inform King Kaàsa of all that had happened. But if He did give the clothes back, they would willingly carry out His orders in the mood of humble servants.</div>
<div class="First"> Çré Kåñëa replied that He had no fear of King Kaàsa, and that if the girls really intended to follow His command and be His maidservants they should each immediately come onto the shore and take their respective garments. The girls, trembling from the cold, climbed out of the water with their two hands covering their private parts. Kåñëa, who felt great affection for them, again spoke: "Because while executing a vow you bathed in the water naked, you have committed an offense against the demigods, and to counteract it you should offer obeisances with joined palms. Then your vow of austerity will achieve its full result."</div>
<div class="First"> The gopés followed this instruction and, folding their hands in respect, offered obeisances to Çré Kåñëa. Satisfied, He gave them back their clothing. But the young girls had become so attracted to Him that they could not leave. Understanding their minds, Kåñëa said that He knew they had worshiped Kätyäyané to get Him as their husband. Because they had offered their hearts to Him, their desires would never again become tainted by the mood of materialistic enjoyment, just as fried barleycorns can no longer grow into shoots. Next autumn, He told them, their most cherished desire would be fulfilled.</div>
<div class="First"> Then the gopés, fully satisfied, returned to Vraja, and Çré Kåñëa and His cowherd friends went off to a distant place to graze the cows. Sometime later, when the boys felt disturbed by the great heat of summer, they took shelter at the base of a tree that stood just like an umbrella. The Lord then said that the life of a tree is most excellent, for even while feeling pain a tree continues to protect others from heat, rain, snow and so on. With its leaves, flowers, fruits, shade, roots, bark, wood, fragrance, sap, ashes, pulp and sprouts, a tree fulfills the desires of everyone. This kind of life is ideal. Indeed, said Kåñëa, the perfection of life is to act with one's vital energy, wealth, intelligence and words for the benefit of all. After the Lord had glorified the trees in this way, the entire company went to the Yamunä, where the cowherd boys let the cows drink the sweet water and also drank some themselves.</div>

<div class="First"> According to various äcäryas, the goddess Durgä mentioned in this verse is not the illusory energy of Kåñëa called Maya but rather the internal potency of the Lord known as Yoga-mäyä. The distinction between the internal and external, or illusory, potency of the Lord is described in the Närada-païcarätra, in the conversation between Çruti and Vidyä:</div>

<div class="First"> "The Lord's inferior potency, known as Durgä, is dedicated to His loving service. Being the Lord's potency, this inferior energy is nondifferent from Him. There is another, superior potency, whose form is on the same spiritual level as that of God Himself. Simply by scientifically understanding this supreme potency, one can immediately achieve the Supreme Soul of all souls, who is the Lord of all lords. There is no other process to achieve Him. That supreme potency of the Lord is known as Gokuleçvaré, the goddess of Gokula. Her nature is to be completely absorbed in love of God, and through Her one can easily obtain the primeval God, the Lord of all that be. This internal potency of the Lord has a covering potency, known as Mahä-mäyä, who rules the material world. In fact she bewilders the entire universe, and thus everyone within the universe falsely identifies himself with the material body." From the above we can understand that the internal and external, or superior and inferior, potencies of the Supreme Lord are personified as Yoga-mäyä and Mahä-mäyä, respectively. The name Durgä is sometimes used to refer to the internal, superior potency, as stated in the Païcarätra: "In all mantras used to worship Kåñëa, the presiding deity is known as Durgä." Thus in the transcendental sound vibrations glorifying and worshiping the Absolute Truth, Kåñëa, the presiding deity of the particular mantra or hymn is called Durgä. The name Durgä therefore refers also to that personality who functions as the internal potency of the Lord and who is thus on the platform of çuddha-sattva, pure transcendental existence. This internal potency is understood to be Kåñëa's sister, known also as Ekänaàçä or Subhadrä. This is the Durgä who was worshiped by the gopés in Våndävana. Several äcäryas have pointed out that ordinary people are sometimes bewildered and think that the names Mahä-mäyä and Durgä refer exclusively to the external potency of the Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> Even if we accept hypothetically that the gopés were worshiping the external Mäyä, there is no fault on their part, since in their pastimes of loving Kåñëa they were acting as ordinary members of society. Çréla Prabhupäda comments in this regard: "The Vaiñëavas generally do not worship any demigods. Çréla Narottama däsa Öhäkura has strictly forbidden all worship of the demigods for anyone who wants to advance in pure devotional service. Yet the gopés, who are beyond compare in their affection for Kåñëa, were seen to worship Durgä. The worshipers of demigods also sometimes mention that the gopés also worshiped goddess Durgä, but we must understand the purpose of the gopés. Generally, people worship goddess Durgä for some material benediction. Here, the gopés could adopt any means to satisfy or serve Kåñëa. That was the superexcellent characteristic of the gopés. They worshiped goddess Durgä completely for one month in order to have Kåñëa as their husband. Every day they prayed for Kåñëa, the son of Nanda Mahäräja, to become their husband." The conclusion is that a sincere devotee of Kåñëa will never imagine any material quality to exist in the transcendental gopés, who are the most exalted devotees of the Lord. The only motivation in all their activities was simply to love and satisfy Kåñëa, and if we foolishly consider their activities to be mundane in any way, it will be impossible for us to understand Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, this incident occurred on the day the young gopés completed their vow, which was a full-moon day. To celebrate the successful completion of their vow, the girls invited young Rädhäräëé—the daughter of Våñabhänu and the special object of their affection—along with other important gopés, and brought them all to the river to bathe. Their playing in the water was meant to serve as the avabhåtha-snäna, the ceremonial bath taken immediately upon the completion of a Vedic sacrifice.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Prabhupäda comments as follows: "It is an old system among Indian girls and women that when they take bath in the river they place their garments on the bank and dip into the water completely naked. The portion of the river where the girls and women take bath was strictly prohibited to any male, and this is still the system. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, knowing the minds of the unmarried young gopés, awarded them their desired objective. They had prayed for Kåñëa to become their husband, and Kåñëa wanted to fulfill their desires."</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> As the master of all masters of mystic power, Lord Kåñëa could easily understand the desires of the gopés, and He could also fulfill them. The gopés, like all young girls from respectable families, considered the embarrassment of appearing naked before a young boy to be worse than giving up their lives. Yet Lord Kåñëa made them come out of the water and bow down to Him. Although the bodily forms of the gopés were all fully developed, and although Kåñëa met them in a secluded place and brought them fully under His control, because the Lord is completely transcendental there was not a trace of material desire in His mind. Lord Kåñëa is the ocean of transcendental bliss, and He wanted to share His bliss with the gopés on the spiritual platform, completely free of ordinary lust.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains that the companions of Kåñëa mentioned here were mere toddlers two or three years old. They were completely naked and were unaware of the difference between male and female. When Kåñëa went out to herd the cows, they followed Him because they were so attached to Him that they could not bear to be without His association.</div>

Thus they did not even consider drowning themselves in the river because of the embarrassing situation.</div>
<div class="First"> They concluded that they could do nothing but go forward to their beloved Kåñëa, putting aside their embarrassment. Thus the gopés assured each other that there was no alternative and rose up out of the water to meet Him.</div>

In other words, the gopés could no longer cover their bodies. We should not foolishly think that Lord Kåñëa is an ordinary lusty boy enjoying the naked beauty of the gopés. Kåñëa is the Supreme Absolute Truth, and He was acting to fulfill the loving desire of the young cowherd girls of Våndävana. In this world we would certainly become lusty in a situation like this. But to compare ourselves to God is a great offense, and because of this offense we will not be able to understand Kåñëa's transcendental position, for we will wrongly take Him to be materially conditioned like ourselves. To lose transcendental sight of Kåñëa is certainly a great disaster for one trying to relish the bliss of the Absolute Truth.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The transcendental position of Kåñëa consciousness is clearly described here. The gopés decided that it was better to renounce their so-called family tradition and traditional morality and simply surrender unto the Supreme Lord Kåñëa. This does not mean that the Kåñëa consciousness movement advocates immoral activities. In fact, the devotees of ISKCON practice the highest standard of restraint and morality, but at the same time we recognize the transcendental position of Kåñëa. Lord Kåñëa is God and therefore has no material desire to enjoy young girls in sexual affairs. As will be seen in this chapter, Lord Kåñëa was not at all attracted to enjoying the gopés; rather He was attracted to their love and wanted to satisfy them. The greatest offense is to imitate the activities of Lord Kåñëa. In India there is a group called präkåta-sahajiyä, who imitate these affairs of Kåñëa and try to enjoy naked young girls in the name of worshiping Kåñëa. The ISKCON movement sternly rejects this mockery of religion, because the greatest offense is for a human being to ludicrously imitate the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the ISKCON movement there are no cheap incarnations, and it is not possible for a devotee of this movement to promote himself to the position of Kåñëa.</div>
<div class="First"> Five hundred years ago Kåñëa appeared as Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu, who practiced strict celibacy throughout His student life and at the age of twenty-four took sannyäsa, a lifelong vow of celibacy. Caitanya Mahäprabhu rigidly avoided contact with women in order to carry out His vow of loving service to Kåñëa. When Kåñëa personally appeared five thousand years ago, He exhibited these wonderful pastimes, which attract our attention. We should not become envious or shocked when we hear that God can perform such pastimes. Our shock is due to our ignorance, because if we tried to perform these activities our bodies would be afflicted by lust. Lord Kåñëa, however, is the Supreme Absolute Truth and is therefore never disturbed by any material desire whatsoever. Thus, this incident—in which the gopés gave up normal standards of morality and, raising their hands to their head, bowed down in compliance with Kåñëa's order—is an example of pure devotional surrender and not a discrepancy in religious principles.</div>
<div class="First"> In fact, the gopés' surrender is the perfection of all religion, as Çréla Prabhupäda describes in Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead: "The gopés were all simple souls, and whatever Kåñëa said, they took to be true. In order to be freed from the wrath of Varuëadeva, as well as to fulfill the desired end of their vows and ultimately to please their worshipable Lord, Kåñëa, they immediately abided by His order. Thus they became the greatest lovers of Kåñëa, and His most obedient servitors.</div>
<div class="First"> "Nothing can compare to the Kåñëa consciousness of the gopés. Actually the gopés did not care for Varuëa or any other demigod; they only wanted to satisfy Kåñëa."</div>

Otherwise, why would He have gone to the trouble of playing with them in this way? Because they thought that Kåñëa was now attached to them, they glanced at Him with shyness, and being stunned by the rising of their ecstatic love, they could not move from where they stood. Kåñëa had overcome their shyness and forced them to come out of the water naked, but now, having dressed properly, they again became shy in His presence. In fact, this incident increased their humbleness before Kåñëa. They did not want Kåñëa to see them staring at Him, but they cautiously took the opportunity to glance at the Lord.</div>

The gopés were certainly attracted to Kåñëa in a mood of conjugal love, and yet, having fixed their minds and indeed their entire existence completely on Kåñëa, their conjugal desire could never manifest as material lust; rather, it became the most exalted form of love of Godhead ever seen within the universe.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains that the cowherd boys were concerned that Kåñëa would be hungry, and thus they feigned their own hunger so that Kåñëa and Balaräma would make suitable arrangements to eat. Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A . C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Twenty-second Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Kåñëa Steals the Garments of the Unmarried Gopés."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 23. The Brähmaëas' Wives Blessed</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter describes how Lord Çré Kåñëa, after inducing the cowherd boys to beg for food, showed mercy to the wives of some brähmaëas performing a sacrifice and made the brähmaëas themselves feel remorse. When the cowherd boys became very hungry, they asked Çré Kåñëa about obtaining food, and He sent them to beg some from a group of brähmaëas who were performing a sacrifice nearby. But these brähmaëas ignored the boys, thinking Çré Kåñëa an ordinary human being. The boys returned disappointed, but the Lord sent them off again, advising them to ask the brähmaëas' wives for the food. These ladies had heard of Kåñëa's transcendental qualities and were very much attached to Him. Thus as soon as they learned He was nearby, they went to Him in great haste, bringing all four varieties of food. In this way they offered themselves to Çré Kåñëa.</div>
<div class="First"> Kåñëa told the women that while one can develop transcendental love for Him by seeing His Deity form in the temple, meditating upon Him and chanting His glories, one cannot achieve this result simply by being in His physical presence. He advised them that since they were housewives, their particular duty was to help their husbands perform sacrifices. He therefore instructed them to return to their homes.</div>
<div class="First"> When the ladies went back home, their brähmaëa husbands at once felt remorse, and they lamented, "For anyone inimical to Kåñëa, his three births-seminal, brahminical and sacrificial-are all condemned. On the other hand, these womenfolk, who have not undergone the purificatory processes of the brahminical class or performed any austerity or pious rituals, have through devotion for Kåñëa easily cut off the bondage of death. "Since Lord Kåñëa's every desire is completely fulfilled, His begging for food was simply an act of mercy toward us brähmaëas. All the fruits of Vedic sacrifice-and indeed all things on earth-are His opulences, yet out of ignorance we could not appreciate this fact."</div>
<div class="First"> Having spoken thus, all the brähmaëas offered their obeisances to Lord Çré Kåñëa, hoping to counteract their offense. Nonetheless, out of fear of King Kaàsa they did not go to see the Lord in person.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The term bhümi-deväù, "gods on earth," refers here to the brähmaëas, who are supposed to closely represent the will of the Supreme Lord. The philosophy of Kåñëa consciousness is not a primitive polytheistic doctrine holding that human beings on the earth are gods. Rather, it is a science that traces the descent of authority from the Absolute Truth Himself, Çré Kåñëa. The authority and power of God naturally extend along with the extension of His creation, and on the earth the Lord's will and authority are represented by purified, enlightened men called brähmaëas.</div>
<div class="First"> This account will illustrate that the ritualistic brähmaëas approached by the cowherd boys were not at all properly enlightened and thus could not appreciate the position of Kåñëa and Balaräma or that of Their intimate associates. In fact, this pastime exposes the pretentious position of so-called brähmaëas who are not faithful devotees of the Supreme Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The cowherd boys doubted the generosity of the brähmaëas, and thus they used the word bubhukñitau, meaning that Kåñëa and Balaräma were hungry. The boys expected the brähmaëas to know the Vedic injunction annasya kñuditaà pätram: "Anyone who is hungry is a fit candidate for receiving food in charity." But if the brähmaëas would not recognize the authority of Kåñëa and Balaräma, their title dvija would be taken to mean merely "born from two parents" (dvi-from two, ja-born) rather than "twice-born." When the brähmaëas did not respond to the cowherd boys' initial request, the boys addressed the brähmaëas, with a slight trace of sarcasm, as dharma-vit-tamäù, "O best of the knowers of religion."</div>

<div class="First"> The cowherd boys anticipated the possible objection from the brähmaëas that they couldn't give the boys any food because they themselves had not yet eaten, and that a priest initiated to perform a sacrifice should not eat. Therefore the boys humbly informed the brähmaëas about various technicalities of ritualistic sacrifice. The cowherd boys were not unaware of the formalities of Vedic culture, but their real intention was simply to render loving service to Lord Kåñëa.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Although the ingredients of sacrificial performance—the place, time, particular paraphernalia, mantras, rituals, priests, fires, demigods, performer, offering and the as yet unseen beneficial results—are all simply aspects of His opulences, the brähmaëas saw Lord Kåñëa as an ordinary human because of their perverted intelligence. They failed to recognize that He is the Supreme Absolute Truth, the directly manifest Personality of Godhead, whom the material senses cannot ordinarily perceive. Thus bewildered by their false identification with the mortal body, they did not show Him proper respect.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The ritualistic brähmaëas could not understand why the sacrificial food should be offered to Lord Kåñëa, whom they considered an ordinary human being. Just as a person with rose-colored glasses sees the entire world as rose-colored, a conditioned soul with mundane vision sees even God Himself as mundane and thus loses the opportunity to go back home, back to Godhead.</div>

Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains that the reason Lord Kåñëa did not have the cowherd boys tell the brähmaëas' wives He was hungry is that He knew this would severely distress these devoted ladies. Simply out of affection for Lord Kåñëa, however, the wives would be happy to give all the food requested of them. They would not heed their husbands' prohibitions, since they resided within the Lord through their transcendental intelligence.</div>

Lord Kåñëa is ätma-priya, the real object of love for everyone. Although each individual has his own taste and freedom, ultimately every living being is a spiritual spark of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; thus everyone's primary loving attraction is constitutionally meant for Lord Çré Kåñëa.

<div class="First"> The word yat-samparkät in this verse refers to contact with the individual self and ultimately with the Supreme Self, the Lord, who is the origin of the individual living being. By developing Kåñëa consciousness, one automatically becomes self-realized, and thus one's vital strength, intelligence, mind, relatives, body, family and wealth all become enhanced and brilliant by the central influence of Kåñëa consciousness. This happens because Kåñëa consciousness is the optimum efficient conjunction of the individual self, who is pure consciousness, with the Supreme Self and supreme consciousness, Kåñëa.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> The wives of the brähmaëas replied: O almighty one, please do not speak such cruel words. Rather, You should fulfill Your promise that You always reciprocate with Your devotees in kind. Now that we have attained Your lotus feet, we simply wish to remain here in the forest so we may carry upon our heads the garlands of tulasé leaves You may neglectfully kick away with Your lotus feet. We are ready to give up all material relationships.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Here the brähmaëas' wives are saying something similar to what the gopés say at the beginning of the räsa dance (SB 10.29.31), when Lord Kåñëa tells them to go home as well. Like this verse, the gopés' statement begins with the words maivaà vibho 'rhati bhavän gadituà nå-çaàsam.</div>
<div class="First"> Nigama refers to the Vedic literature, which states that one who surrenders at the lotus feet of the Lord does not return to this material world. Thus the brähmaëas' wives appealed to the Lord that since they had surrendered to Him, it was unfair for Him to order them to return to their materialistic husbands. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, Lord Kåñëa might have pointed out to the brähmaëas' wives, "You young ladies are members of the aristocratic brähmaëa community, so how can you surrender at the feet of a mere cowherd boy?"</div>
<div class="First"> To this the ladies might have replied, "Since we have already surrendered at Your lotus feet, and since we desire to become Your servants, we are obviously not maintaining a false identification as members of the so-called brähmaëa community. You can easily ascertain this from our words." Lord Kåñëa might have replied, "I am a cowherd boy, and My proper maidservants and girlfriends are the cowherd girls, the gopés. " The wives might have answered, "True, let them be so. Let them shine forth if You are embarrassed in front of Your relatives to make brähmaëa ladies Your maidservants. We certainly don't want to embarrass You. We will not go to Your village but will rather remain in Våndävana, like presiding deities of the forest. We simply desire to perfect our lives by even a slight trace of connection with You."</div>
<div class="First"> Thus by the spiritual insight of Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, we learn that the brähmaëas' wives offered to remain at a distance and simply take the tulasé leaves that would fall from the lotus feet of Kåñëa or be crushed by the feet of His girlfriends when He would embrace them. The ladies offered to carry these tulasé leaves upon their heads. Thus renouncing the desire to become Kåñëa's intimate girlfriends or maidservants (a position they knew was difficult to achieve), the young brähmaëa ladies begged to remain in Våndävana forest. If the Lord had then asked "Then what will your family members say?" they would have replied "We have already transcended our so-called relatives because we are seeing You, the Supreme Lord, face to face."</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura comments as follows: "From their very youth the brähmaëas' wives had heard about Lord Kåñëa's beauty, qualities and sweetness from the womenfolk of Våndävana village, and also from the flower ladies, the betel-nut sellers and others. Consequently they always felt ecstatic love for Kåñëa and were indifferent to their household duties. Their husbands, seeing them as deviant, doubted them and avoided dealing with them as far as possible. Now the wives of the brähmaëas were ready to formally reject their so-called families and neighbors, and out of great agitation they were crying and placing their heads upon Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet, offering obeisances. In this way, with choking voices, they spoke the above verse. They begged that Lord Kåñëa bestow upon them the benediction that He be their only destination, that He, the chastiser of enemies, subdue all their enemies—those difficulties obstructing them from attaining the Lord." The wives of the brähmaëas simply wanted to serve Lord Kåñëa, and this is pure Kåñëa consciousness in ecstatic love of Godhead.</div>

In other words, it would be best all around if they continued to fix their minds on Lord Kåñëa and thus went on with the process they had been practicing throughout their lives.

<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté goes on to state that while one may object that it is not fitting for a woman to love anyone other than her husband, here the husbands themselves point out that they are gurus only in imitation of the Supreme Lord, who is jagad-guru, the universal teacher and spiritual master. The husbands noted that the women, having perfected their transcendental attachment for Kåñëa, did not have even a trace of attachment left for home, husband, children and so forth.

<div class="First"> Realizing their offense against Lord Kåñëa, and finally appreciating His almighty position, the brähmaëas naturally wanted to rush to Vraja and surrender at the lotus feet of the Lord. But they were afraid that Kaàsa would certainly kill them when his spies reported that they had gone to Kåñëa. The brähmaëas' wives were absorbed in ecstatic Kåñëa consciousness and thus went to Kåñëa anyway, just as the gopés, simply to dance with the Lord, traveled in the dead of night through a forest inhabited by wild animals. But the brähmaëas were not on such an advanced platform of Kåñëa consciousness and thus, overcome by fear of Kaàsa, could not see the Lord face to face. Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A . C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Twenty-third Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Brähmaëas' Wives Blessed."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 24. Worshiping Govardhana Hill</div>
<div class="First"> In this chapter Lord Çré Kåñëa crushes the pride of Indra by prohibiting a sacrifice intended for him and initiating a substitute sacrifice in worship of Govardhana Hill.</div>
<div class="First"> When Çré Kåñëa saw the cowherd men busily preparing for a sacrifice to Indra, He inquired about it from their king, Nanda. Nanda explained that the rain given by Indra enables all living entities to maintain their lives, and therefore this sacrifice would be executed to satisfy him. Kåñëa responded, "It is because of karma alone that living entities take their birth in a certain body, experience varieties of happiness and suffering in that body, and then give it up as the karma pertaining to it runs out. Thus it is karma alone that is our enemy, our friend, our guru and our lord, and Indra can do nothing to alter the happiness and distress of anyone, for everyone is tightly bound by his karmic reactions. The material modes of goodness, passion and ignorance bring about the creation, maintenance and destruction of this world. The clouds give forth rain when they are impelled by the mode of passion, and cowherds prosper by protecting the cows. Furthermore, the cowherds' proper residence is in the forest and on the hills. Therefore you should offer worship to the cows, the brähmaëas and Govardhana Hill."</div>
<div class="First"> After Kåñëa spoke thus, He arranged for the cowherd men to worship Govardhana with the paraphernalia collected for the sacrifice to Indra. He then assumed a huge, unprecedented transcendental form and devoured all the food and other offerings presented to Govardhana. As He did so He proclaimed to the cowherd community that although they had worshiped Indra for so long, he had never appeared in person, whereas Govardhana himself had now manifested before their eyes and eaten their offerings of foodstuffs. Therefore they should all now offer obeisances to Govardhana Hill. Then Lord Kåñëa joined the cowherds in offering obeisances to His own newly assumed form.</div>

<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa minimized the importance of the demigods by speaking the philosophy known as Karma-väda or Karma-mémäàsä, which, basically, is atheism with a belief in reincarnation. According to this philosophy, there are subtle laws of nature that reward or punish us according to how we act: "As you sow, so shall you reap." In a future life one reaps the fruit of his present work, and this is the sum and substance of reality. Lord Kåñëa, being God Himself, could hardly be a serious proponent of this mediocre philosophy. In the role of a young boy He was simply teasing His pure devotees by preaching it.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Jéva Gosvämé points out that Lord Kåñëa was thinking, "Why are these eternal associates of Mine, appearing as My father and other relatives and friends, so caught up in this worship of Indra?" Thus although the Lord's main purpose was to take away the false pride of Indra, He also wanted to remind His eternal devotees that they need not divert their attention to other so-called gods, since in fact His devotees were already living with the Supreme Absolute Truth, the almighty Lord Himself.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Here Lord Kåñëa argues that if there is a supreme controller, He must depend on a performer of activity to reciprocate with and must therefore also be subject to the laws of karma, being obliged to award happiness and distress to conditioned souls according to the laws of good and evil. This superficial argument neglects the obvious point that the laws of nature that prescribe the good and bad results of pious and impious acts are themselves creations of the all-good Supreme Lord. Being the creator and sustainer of these laws, the Lord is not subject to them. Furthermore, the Lord is not dependent on the work of the conditioned souls, since He is satisfied and complete within Himself. Out of His all-merciful nature He awards the results appropriate to our activities. That which we call destiny, fate or karma is an elaborate and subtle system of rewards and punishments meant for gradually encouraging conditioned souls to evolve to the stage of perfect consciousness, which is their original, constitutional nature. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has so dexterously formulated and applied the laws of material nature governing punishment and reward for human behavior that the living being is discouraged from sin and encouraged toward goodness without suffering any significant interference with his free will as an eternal soul.</div>
<div class="First"> In contrast to the material nature, the Lord exhibits His essential nature in the spiritual world, where He reciprocates the eternal love of His pure devotees. Such loving affairs are based completely on the mutual freedom of the Lord and His devotees, not on a mechanical reciprocation of coinciding selfish interests. The Supreme Lord, assisted by His pure devotees, repeatedly offers the conditioned souls of this world the opportunity to give up their bizarre attempt at exploiting the material universe and go back home, back to Godhead, for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge. Considering all these points, the atheistic arguments given here by Lord Kåñëa in a playful mood are not to be taken seriously.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa's argument here is not a negation of free will. If one accepts the existence of karma as a system of laws awarding reactions for our present activities, then we ourselves, according to our nature, will decide our future. Our happiness and distress in this life have already been adjudicated and fixed according to our previous activities, and not even the demigods can change that. They must award us the prosperity or poverty, sickness or health, happiness or distress due us by our previous work. However, we still retain the freedom to select a pious or impious mode of activity in this life, and the choice we make will determine our future suffering and enjoyment. For example, if I was pious in my last life, in this life the demigods may award me great material wealth. But I am free to spend my riches for good or for bad purposes, and my choice will determine my future life. Thus, although no one can change the karmic results due him in this life, everyone still retains his free will, by which he determines what his future situation will be. Lord Kåñëa's argument here is quite interesting; however, it neglects the overriding consideration that we are all eternal servants of God and must satisfy Him by all that we do.</div>

<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa here elaborates upon the argument given in the previous verse.

<div class="First"> Even the demigods are bound and limited by the laws of karma. That Indra himself is subordinate to the laws of karma is explicitly stated in the Brahma-saàhitä (5.54): yas tv indra-gopam atha vendram aho sva-karma-bandhänurüpa-phala-bhäjanam ätanoti. The Supreme Lord, Govinda, awards all creatures the appropriate results of their work. This is as true for mighty Indra, the lord of the material heavens, as it is for the germ called indra-gopa. The Bhagavad-gétä (7.20) also states, kämais tais tair håta-jïänäù prapadyante 'nya-devatäù. Only those who have lost their intelligence because of various material desires surrender unto demigods rather than worship the Supreme Lord. In fact, the demigods cannot award benefits to anyone independently, as stated by Lord Kåñëa in the Gétä: mayaiva vihitän hi tän. All benefits are ultimately issued by the Lord Himself. Thus it is not altogether incorrect to say that demigod worship is useless, since even the demigods are under the laws of karma. In fact, this is the case. But Lord Kåñëa, the Supreme Absolute Truth, is not subordinate to the law of karma; rather, He can independently offer or withhold His favor. This is confirmed in the verse from the Brahma-saàhitä quoted above, the third line of which is karmäëi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhäjäm: [Bs. 5.54] "The Supreme Lord burns up all the accumulated karma of those engaged in His loving service." Not only is Lord Kåñëa above the laws of material action and reaction, but He can immediately dissolve these laws for anyone who satisfies Him through loving service. Thus the almighty God is supreme in absolute freedom, and by surrendering to Him we can escape the bonds of karma and stop accepting their dismal rule as supreme.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa here proposes the modern if absurd philosophy that our work or occupation is really God and that we should therefore simply worship our work. Upon close scrutiny, we observe that our work is nothing more than the interaction of the material body with material nature, as Lord Kåñëa Himself states~ in a more serious mood, in the Bhagavad-gétä (3.28): guëä guëeñu vartanta. Karma-mémäàsä philosophy accepts that good activity in this life will give us a better next life. If this is true, there must be some type of conscious soul different from the body. And if that is the case, why should a transcendental soul worship the interaction of the temporary body with material nature? If the words sampüjayet karma here mean that one should worship the laws of karma governing our activities, then one may astutely ask what it means to worship laws and, indeed, what might be the origin of such laws and who is maintaining them. To say that laws have created or are maintaining the world is a meaningless proposition, since there is nothing about the nature of a law that indicates it could generate the existential situation it is supposed to govern. In fact, worship is meant for Kåñëa Himself, and this real conclusion will be clearly revealed in this chapter.</div>

<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa here points out that the residents of Våndävana should recognize their relationship with Govardhana Hill and with the forests of Våndävana, and not worry about a distant demigod like Indra.

The residents of Våndävana were overwhelmed in loving service to that Supreme Absolute Truth; therefore they were the most fortunate, most intelligent and most pragmatic of all living beings.</div>

Then Kåñëa began to eat all the food offered there. The identity of Kåñëa and Govardhana Hill is still honored, and great devotees take rocks from Govardhana Hill and worship them exactly as they worship the Deity of Kåñëa in the temples. The followers of the Krsna consciousness movement may therefore collect small rocks or pebbles from Govardhana Hill and worship them at home, because this worship is as good as Deity worship."</div>

The Lord presented these arguments not because He believed them but rather because He wanted to stop the impending sacrifice to Indra and divert it to Himself in the form of Govardhana Hill.

<div class="First"> Although the Govardhana-püjä was performed in a blissful and successful way, the matter was hardly finished. Lord Indra is, after all, tremendously powerful, and he received the news of the Govardhana sacrifice with burning anger. What ensued will be described in the following chapter. Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Twenty-fourth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Worshiping Govardhana Hill."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 25. Lord Kåñëa Lifts Govardhana Hill</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter describes how Lord Indra was overcome by anger when the residents of Vraja canceled his sacrifice, how he tried to punish them by sending forth a devastating rainfall to Våndävana, and how Lord Çré Kåñëa protected Gokula by lifting Govardhana Hill and for seven days using it as an umbrella to ward off the rain.</div>
<div class="First"> Indra, angered at the disruption of the sacrifice meant for him and falsely presuming himself the supreme controller, said, "People often give up the pursuit of transcendental knowledge-the means for self-realization-and imagine that they can cross over the ocean of material existence by mundane fruitive sacrifices. Similarly, these cowherd men have become intoxicated by pride and have offended me by taking shelter of an ignorant, ordinary child-Kåñëa."</div>
<div class="First"> To remove this supposed pride of the residents of Vraja, Indra sent the clouds known as Säàvartaka, whose function is to facilitate the destruction of the world. He sent them to harass the Vrajaväsés with downpours of rain and hail. The cowherd community was very disturbed by this and approached Kåñëa for shelter. Understanding that this trouble was the work of Indra, Kåñëa decided to smash to pieces Indra's false prestige, and thus He lifted Govardhana Hill with one hand. He then invited the entire cowherd community to take shelter in the dry space beneath the mountain. For seven successive days He held up the hill, until Indra finally understood Kåñëa's mystic power and ordered the clouds to withdraw.</div>
<div class="First"> When the cowherd villagers emerged from beneath the mountain, Kåñëa put Govardhana Hill back in its proper place. The cowherds were in ecstasy, showing loving symptoms such as flowing tears and bodily hairs standing on end. They embraced Kåñëa and offered Him benedictions according to their respective positions, while the demigods in heaven rained down flowers and sang the Lord's praises.</div>

<div class="First"> At the very beginning of this chapter Çukadeva Gosvämé reveals the foolishness of Indra and the absurdity of his anger. Indra was frustrated because the residents of Våndävana accepted Çré Kåñëa as their Lord. But the simple fact is that Çré Kåñëa is the Lord, not only of the residents of Våndävana but of all that exists, including Indra himself. Thus Indra's petulant reaction was ridiculous. As the common saying goes, "Pride goes before a fall."</div>

<div class="First"> The word éça-mäné here is very significant. Indra arrogantly considered himself to be the Lord, and thus he exhibited the typical attitude of a conditioned soul. Many thinkers in the twentieth century have noted the exaggerated sense of individual prestige characteristic of our culture; indeed, writers have even coined the phrase "the me generation." Everyone in this world is more or less guilty of the syndrome called éça-mäna, or proudly considering oneself the Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, through the insults of Indra Goddess Sarasvaté is actually praising Kåñëa. The äcärya explains: "Väcälam means 'one who can speak according to Vedic authority.' Bäliçam means 'free from pretension, just like a child.' Stabdham means that He bows down to no one because there is no one for Him to offer homage to, ajïam means that there is nothing more for Him to know because He is omniscient, paëòita-mäninam means that He is highly honored by the knowers of the Absolute Truth, and kåñëam means He is the Supreme Absolute Truth, whose transcendental form is full of eternity and ecstasy. Martyam means that although He is the Absolute Truth, He nevertheless appears in this world as a human being out of affection for His devotees."</div>
<div class="First"> Indra wanted to rebuke Kåñëa as väcälam because the Lord had presented many audacious arguments in the line of Karma-mémäàsä and Säìkhya philosophy even though He did not accept these arguments; thus Indra called the Lord bäliça, "foolish." Indra called Him stabdha because He had spoken boldly even in the presence of His own father. Thus although Indra attempted to criticize Çré Kåñëa, the Lord's transcendental character is in fact impeccable, and this chapter will demonstrate how Indra came to recognize the position of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> It is clear from this verse that the residents of Våndävana had become highly prosperous simply by protecting cows, since Indra wanted to destroy their so-called pride based on wealth by killing their animals. Well-tended cows produce large quantities of milk, from which come cheese, butter, yogurt, ghee and so on. These foods are delicious by themselves and also enhance other foods, such as fruits, vegetables and grains. Bread and vegetables are delicious with butter, and fruit is especially appetizing when mixed with cream or yogurt. Dairy products are always desirable in civilized society, and the surplus can be traded for many valuable commodities. Thus, simply by a Vedic dairy enterprise, the residents of Våndävana were wealthy, healthy and happy, even in the material sense, and most of all they were eternal associates of the Supreme Lord Kåñëa.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The demigods are supposed to be sad-bhäva-yukta, endowed with spiritual existence, since they are deputed servants of the Supreme Lord. In the Bhagavad-gétä (4.24) it is stated:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">brahmärpaëaà brahma havir</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">brahmägnau brahmaëä hutam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">brahmaiva tena gantavyaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">brahma-karma-samädhinä</div>
<div class="First"> "That which is duly offered to the Lord becomes spiritualized." The demigods engage in the devotional service of the Lord by managing various departments of cosmic administration. Therefore as demigods, or as servants of the Lord, their existence is pure (sad-bhäva). When the demigods fail to live up to the high position given them by the Lord and deviate from proper behavior, they are not acting as demigods but rather as conditioned souls. Mäna, or false prestige, is certainly an anxiety-ridden burden for the conditioned soul. A falsely proud person is not truly peaceful or satisfied, because his understanding of himself is false and inflated. When a servant of the Lord becomes asat, or irreligious, the Lord saves him from impiety by breaking the false prestige that has led him to be offensive or sinful. As stated by the Lord Himself, yasyäham anugåhëämi hariñye tad-dhanaà çanaiù: [SB 10.88.8] "I give My blessings to a person by taking away his so-called opulence." Of course, the advanced stage of devotional service to the Lord, as described by Rüpa Gosvämé, is yukta-vairägya, utilizing the opulence of this world to execute the Lord's mission. Obviously the things of this world can be used wonderfully to spread the glories of God and to create a godly society, and a more advanced devotee will not be seduced by material paraphernalia but will dutifully and honestly engage it solely for the pleasure of the Lord. In this particular case, Lord Indra forgot that he was a humble servant of God, and Lord Kåñëa therefore arranged to bring this bewildered demigod to his senses.</div>

<div class="First"> The word mac-charaëam indicates not only that Lord Kåñëa was the sole shelter for the vraja-jana, the people of Våndävana, but also that Lord Kåñëa had established His home among them. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura quotes from the Anekärtha-varga dictionary, çaraëaà gåha-rakñitroù: "The word çaraëam can represent either home or protector." The residents of Våndävana adopted Kåñëa as their beloved child, friend, lover and life itself, and the Lord reciprocated their feelings. Thus Çré Kåñëa lived among these fortunate people, moving in their houses and fields; naturally He would protect such intimate devotees from all types of danger.</div>

According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, when Lord Kåñëa was preparing to lift Govardhana Hill, a partial expansion of His Yogamäyä potency named Saàhäriké temporarily removed all the rain from the sky so that as He ran very swiftly from the porch of His house to the mountain, neither His turban nor other garments became wet.</div>

<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura provides the following insight in this regard: Ordinarily a large cowherd community, which included many thousands of cows, calves, bulls and so on, could not fit under the base of a medium-sized hill like Çré Govardhana. However, because the hill was in ecstasy, being touched by the hand of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it acquired inconceivable power and even felt the hundreds of deadly thunderbolts thrown upon its back by angry Indra to be offerings of soft, fragrant flowers. At times Çré Govardhana was not even aware that the thunderbolts were striking. From the Hari-vaàça the äcärya has also quoted Çré Kåñëa Himself as saying, trai-lokyam apy utsahate rakñituà kià punar vrajam: "Çré Govardhana can give shelter to all the three worlds, what to speak of the simple land of Vraja."</div>
<div class="First"> When Indra's attack began and Kåñëa lifted the hill, the deer, wild hogs, and other animals and birds standing on the hill's flanks climbed up to its peaks, and even they did not experience the slightest distress.</div>

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Twenty-fifth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Lord Kåñëa Lifts Govardhana Hill."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 26. Wonderful Kåñëa</div>
<div class="First"> In this chapter Nanda Mahäräja describes Kåñëa's opulences to the cowherd men, as Nanda had heard of them from Garga Muni.</div>
<div class="First"> The cowherd men, unaware of Lord Kåñëa's power, were amazed to see His various extraordinary activities. The men approached Nanda Mahäräja and told him that after seeing how Kåñëa, a boy only seven years old, had lifted a mountain, and how He had previously killed the demoness Pütanä and generated extreme attraction in the hearts of everyone in Våndävana, the men had become doubtful and bewildered about how Çré Kåñëa could possibly have taken birth in the unsuitable environment of a cowherd community. Nanda replied by relating to them what Garga Muni had told him about Çré Kåñëa. Garga Muni had said that in the previous three ages Nanda's boy had manifested Himself in white, red and yellow forms, whereas now, in the Dväpara age, He had assumed His darkish-blue form, kåñëa-rüpa. Because He descended as the son of Vasudeva, one of His many names is Väsudeva, and He has innumerable other names indicating His many qualities and activities. Garga Muni had predicted that Kåñëa would prevent all sorts of catastrophes in Gokula, spread unlimited auspiciousness, and increase the ecstasy of the cowherd men and women. In a previous age He had provided protection for the saintly brähmaëas when they were harassed by low-class dacoits and there was no proper ruler in society. As the demons in the higher planets can never defeat the demigods who have Lord Viñëu on their side, no enemy can ever defeat those who love Kåñëa. In His affinity for His devotees and in His opulence and power, Kåñëa is just like Lord Näräyaëa Himself. Overjoyed and awestruck by Garga Muni's statements, the cowherd men concluded that Kåñëa must be an empowered representative of the Supreme Lord, Näräyaëa. Thus they worshiped Him and Nanda Mahäräja.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Çukadeva Gosvämé said: The cowherd men were astonished when they saw Kåñëa's activities, such as lifting Govardhana Hill. Unable to understand His transcendental potency, they approached Nanda Mahäräja and spoke as follows.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains this verse as follows: "During Lord Kåñëa's pastime of lifting Çré Govardhana Hill, the cowherd men simply enjoyed the spiritual bliss of the Lord's activities without analyzing them. But afterwards, when they had returned to their homes, perplexity arose within their hearts. Thus they thought, 'Now we have directly seen child Kåñëa lift Govardhana Hill, and we remember how He killed Pütanä and other demons, extinguished the forest fire, and so on. At the time, we thought that these extraordinary acts occurred because of a benediction from the brähmaëas or because of Nanda Mahäräja's great fortune, or that perhaps this boy had achieved the mercy of Lord Näräyaëa and was thus empowered by Him. " 'But all these presumptions are false, because an ordinary seven-year old boy could never hold up the king of mountains for seven whole days. Kåñëa is not a human being. He must be the Supreme Lord Himself. " 'But on the other hand, child Kåñëa loves it when we coddle Him, and He becomes morose when we—His uncles and well-wishers, simply worldly cowherd men—do not give Him attention. He appears to become hungry and thirsty, steals yogurt and milk, sometimes plays tricks, tells lies, chatters childishly and tends the calves. If He is actually the Supreme Lord, why would He do these things? Don't they indicate that He is an ordinary human child? " 'We are totally unable to establish the truth of His identity. Therefore let us go and inquire from the highly intelligent King of Vraja, Nanda Mahäräja, and he shall free us from our doubts.' "</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the cowherd men thus made up their minds, and then they entered Nanda Mahäräja's great assembly hall and questioned him as described in the following verse.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Dear Nanda, how is it that we and all the other residents of Vraja cannot give up our constant affection for your son? And how is it that He is so spontaneously attracted to us?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The very word kåñëa means "the all-attractive one." The residents of Våndävana could not give up their constant love (anuräga) for Lord Kåñëa. Their attitude toward Him was not particularly theistic, because they were unsure whether He was God or not. But He attracted all their love precisely because as God He is the all-attractive person, the supreme object of our love. The cowherd men also asked, "How is it that young Kåñëa feels such constant love for us?" In fact the Supreme Lord loves all living beings, who are eternally His children. At the end of the Bhagavad-gétä, Lord Kåñëa dramatically declares His affection for Arjuna and urges Arjuna to reciprocate that love by surrendering to Him. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, in His prayers to Lord Kåñëa, states, etädåçé tava kåpä bhagavan mamäpi durdaivam édåçam ihäjani nänurägaù: "My Lord, You are so merciful toward Me, but I am so unfortunate that love for You has not awakened within Me." (Çikñäñöaka 2) In this statement Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu also uses the word anuräga. Our misfortune is that we cannot reciprocate the anuräga, or loving affection, that the Lord feels for us. Although we are infinitesimal and insignificant and the Lord is infinitely attractive, somehow we do not give Him our love. We must accept responsibility for this foolish decision, since to surrender to God or not is the essential expression of our free will.</div>
<div class="First"> The Kåñëa consciousness movement provides an efficient, systematic program to help conditioned souls revive their original, blissful consciousness, which is love of God, Kåñëa consciousness. The intricacies of Kåñëa consciousness are so wonderful that even Kåñëa's eternal associates, the residents of Våndävana, are astonished by them, as shown by these verses.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Indra became angry when his sacrifice was disrupted, and thus he caused rain and hail to fall on Gokula, accompanied by lightning and powerful winds, all of which brought great suffering to the cowherds, animals and women there. When Lord Kåñëa, who is by nature always compassionate, saw the condition of those who had only Him as their shelter, He smiled broadly and lifted Govardhana Hill with one hand, just as a small child picks up a mushroom to play with it. Holding up the hill, He protected the cowherd community. May He, Govinda, the Lord of the cows and the destroyer of Indra's false pride, be pleased with us.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word indra means "lord" or "king." Thus in this verse Kåñëa is pointedly called indro gaväm, "the Lord of the cows." In fact, He is the real Indra, the real ruler, of everyone, and the demigods are merely His servants, representing His supreme will.</div>
<div class="First"> It is apparent from this and the previous verses in this chapter that Lord Kåñëa's lifting of Govardhana Hill made quite an impression on the simple cowherd men of Våndävana, and they repeatedly remembered this feat. Certainly anyone who soberly and objectively considers the activities of young Kåñëa will surrender to Him and become His eternal devotee in loving devotional service. That is the rational conclusion one should come to after reading this chapter.</div>
<div class="First"> Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Twenty-sixth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Wonderful Kåñëa."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 27. Lord Indra and Mother Surabhi Offer Prayers</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter describes how the Surabhi cow and Indra, having seen the amazing power of Lord Kåñëa, performed a bathing ceremony for Him. Ashamed of having attacked Våndävana with a violent storm, Indra secretly came before Lord Kåñëa, offered obeisances and praised Him. Indra stated that although Çré Kåñëa is never caught in the current of material illusion, which is born of ignorance, He nevertheless accepts a humanlike body and performs various activities to establish religious principles and chastise the wicked. By this means He crushes the false prestige of those who presume themselves great controllers. Indra went on to declare that Kåñëa is the father, guru and Lord of all living entities, and that in the form of time He is the agent of their punishment.</div>
<div class="First"> Satisfied with Indra's prayers, Çré Kåñëa told him that He had stopped the indra-yajïa so that Indra, puffed up as he was with false pride, would remember the Lord. Persons intoxicated by material opulence never see Him standing before them with the rod of punishment in His hand. Therefore if Lord Kåñëa desires the actual good fortune of some person, He brings him down from his position of opulence.</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa ordered Indra to return to his proper position in heaven and to serve there without egotism. Indra, along with the cow Surabhi, then performed a bathing ceremony for Kåñëa, using the water of the heavenly Ganges and the milk of mother Surabhi. Indra and the cow took this opportunity to bestow upon the Lord the name Govinda, and the demigods showered flowers and recited various prayers.</div>

Certainly Indra was ashamed, and also nervous about his future.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The great Bhägavatam commentator Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has masterfully explained the Sanskrit elements of this profound verse. The Sanskrit word dhäma has several meanings: a) dwelling place, house, abode and so on; b) a favorite thing or person; delight; or pleasure; c) form or appearance; d) power, strength, majesty, glory, splendor or light. Concerning the first set of meanings, the Vedänta-sütra states that the Absolute Truth is the source and resting place of all existence, and in the first verse of the Bhägavatam that Absolute Truth is said to be Kåñëa. Although Lord Kåñëa exists in His own dhäma, or abode, called Kåñëaloka, He Himself is the abode of all existence, as Arjuna confirms in the Bhagavad-gétä, where he addresses Kåñëa as paraà dhäma, "the supreme abode."</div>
<div class="First"> The very name Kåñëa indicates the all-attractive person, and thus Lord Kåñëa, the source of all beauty and pleasure, is certainly "the favorite thing or person; delight; and pleasure." Ultimately these terms can refer only to Kåñëa. Dhäma also refers to form or appearance, and as Indra offered these prayers he was in fact directly seeing the form of Kåñëa before him. As clearly explained in the Vedic literature, Lord Kåñëa's power, strength, majesty, splendor and effulgence are all contained within His transcendental body and thus attest to the infinite glories of the Lord. Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has brilliantly summarized all these meanings of the word dhäma by giving the Sanskrit term svarüpa as a synonym. The word svarüpa means "one's own form or shape" and also "one's own condition, character or nature." Since Lord Kåñëa, being pure spirit, is nondifferent from His body, there is absolutely no difference between the Lord and His visible form. By contrast, in this material world we conditioned souls are all distinctly different from our bodies, whether those bodies be male, female, black, white or whatever. All of us are eternal souls, different from our temporary, flimsy bodies.</div>
<div class="First"> When the word svarüpa is applied to us, it especially indicates our spiritual form, because our "own form" is in fact our "own condition, character or nature" eternally. Thus the liberated condition in which one's outward form is one's deepest spiritual nature is called svarüpa. Primarily, however, this term refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa. This is all indicated in this verse by the words tava dhäma, as explained by Çrédhara Svämé. Çrédhara Svämé has explained that here the word çäntam means "always in the same form." Çäntam can also mean "undisturbed, free from passion, or purified." According to Vedic philosophy, all change in this world is caused by the influence of passion and ignorance. The passionate mode is creative, and the ignorant mode is destructive, whereas the mode of goodness, sattva, is serene and sustaining. In many ways this verse emphasizes that Lord Kåñëa is free from the modes of nature. The words viçuddha-sattvam, çäntam, dhvasta-rajas-tamaskam and guëa-sampraväho na vidyate te all indicate this. Unlike Kåñëa, we change from one body to another because of our involvement with the modes of nature; the various transformations of material forms are impelled by the modes of nature, which are themselves set in motion by the influence of time. Therefore one who is free from the material modes of nature is changeless and eternally satisfied in blissful spiritual existence. Thus the word çäntam indicates that the Lord is undisturbed by change, since He is free from the material modes of nature.</div>
<div class="First"> According to this verse, the powerful flow of the material modes of nature—namely passion, stupidity and mundane piety—are based on agrahaëa, which Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has translated as "ignorance." Since the Sanskrit root graù means "to take, accept, grasp or comprehend," grahaëa means "grasp" exactly in the sense of "to grasp an idea or fact." Therefore agrahaëa here means one's failure to understand one's spiritual position, and this failure causes one to fall into the violent currents of material existence. An additional meaning of the word agrahaëa is derived when it is divided into the compound agra-haëa. Agra means "the first, top or best," and hana means "killing." The best part of our existence is the pure soul, which is eternal, in contradistinction to the temporary, material body and mind. Thus one who chooses material existence over Kåñëa consciousness is in fact killing the best part of himself, the soul, which in its pure state can enjoy Kåñëa consciousness unlimitedly.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has translated tapo-mayam as "full of knowledge." The word tapas, generally indicating "austerity," is derived from the Sanskrit verb tap, whose meaning can be summarized as indicating the various functions of the sun. Tap means "to burn, to shine, to heat and so on." The Supreme Lord is eternally perfect, and therefore here tapo-mayam does not indicate that His transcendental body is meant for austerities, since austerities are performed by conditioned souls to purify themselves or to acquire a particular power. An omnipotent, perfect being neither purifies Himself nor acquires power: He is eternally pure and all-powerful. Therefore Çrédhara Svämé has intelligently understood that in this case the word tapas refers to the illuminating function of the sun and thus indicates that the Lord's self-effulgent body is omniscient. Light is a common symbol of knowledge. The Lord's spiritual effulgence does not merely illuminate physically, as in the case of a candle or light bulb; more importantly, the Lord's body illuminates our consciousness with perfect knowledge because the Lord's effulgence is itself perfect knowledge. We offer our respectful obeisances at the lotus feet of Çréla Çrédhara Svämé and thank him for his enlightening comments on this verse.</div>

<div class="Translation"> How, then, could there exist in You the symptoms of an ignorant person—such as greed, lust, anger and envy—which are produced by one's previous involvement in material existence and which cause one to become further entangled in material existence? And yet as the Supreme Lord You impose punishment to protect religious principles and curb down the wicked.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> This complex philosophical statement by Indra may be analyzed as follows: In the first line of this verse, Indra refers to the main idea expressed at the end of the previous verse—namely, that the great currents of material existence, which are based on ignorance, cannot possibly exist within the Supreme Lord. The words tad-dhetavaù and tat-kåtäù indicate that something causes the modes of nature to manifest, and that they in turn become the cause of that which caused them. In the second line of this verse, we find that it is material feelings such as greed, lust, envy and anger that cause the modes of nature to manifest and that are themselves caused by the modes of nature. The explanation of this seeming paradox is as follows: When the conditioned soul decides to associate with the material qualities, he becomes contaminated by those qualities. As stated in the Gétä (13.22), käraëaà guëa-saìgo 'sya sad-asad-yoni-janmasu. For example, in the presence of a seductive woman, a man may give in to his lower instincts and try to enjoy sex with her. By his deciding to associate with the lower qualities of nature, those qualities manifest in him very powerfully. He is overwhelmed with lust and driven to try again and again to satisfy his burning desire. Because his mind has been infected by lust, all that he does, thinks and speaks will be influenced by his strong attachment to sex. In other words, by choosing to associate with the lusty qualities of nature, he has caused them to powerfully manifest within himself, and eventually those lusty qualities themselves will cause him to accept another material body suitable for affairs governed by those qualities. The lower qualities, such as lust, greed, anger and envy, are abudha-liìga-bhäväù, symptoms of ignorance. Indeed, as indicated by Çréla Çrédhara Svämé in his commentary, the manifestation of the modes of nature is synonymous with the manifestation of a particular material body. It is clearly explained throughout the Vedic literature that the conditioned soul receives a particular body, gives it up and then accepts another simply because of his involvement with the modes of nature(käraëaà guëa-saìgo 'sya [Bg. 13.22]). Thus to say that one is participating in the modes of nature is to say that one is accepting particular types of bodies suitable for the particular material qualities one is involved with.</div>
<div class="First"> An ignorant bystander might have simplistically interpreted Kåñëa's pastime of lifting Govardhana Hill as follows: The residents of Våndävana were obliged by Vedic principles to make certain offerings to the god of heaven, Indra. Child Kåñëa, ignoring the position of Indra, usurped these offerings and took them for His own pleasure. When Indra tried to punish Kåñëa and His associates, the Lord frustrated Indra's attempt, humiliated him, and exhausted his pride and resources.</div>
<div class="First"> But this superficial interpretation is refuted in this verse. Here Lord Indra addresses Çré Kåñëa as bhagavän, indicating that He is not an ordinary child but in fact God. Therefore Kåñëa's punishing Indra was part of His mission of protecting religious principles and curbing down the envious; it was not a display of material anger or of greed for the offerings meant for Indra. Çré Kåñëa is pure spiritual existence, and His simple, sublime desire is to engage all living beings in the perfect, blissful life of Kåñëa consciousness. Kåñëa's desire to make us Kåñëa conscious is not egotistical, since ultimately Kåñëa is everything and Kåñëa consciousness is objectively the best consciousness. Lord Indra is really the humble servant of Kåñëa, a fact he is now beginning to remember.</div>

<div class="First"> The word hitäya is significant here. Lord Kåñëa protects religion and chastises the wicked for the benefit of the entire universe. Foolish and faithless pseudopriests criticize God for punishing the living entities through the actions of nature. But whether Lord Kåñëa punishes them indirectly through nature or directly in His incarnations, as mentioned here, He has a perfect right to do so because He is the father, spiritual master and supreme ruler of the entire universe. Another way He curbs down the false attempts of the conditioned souls to establish the kingdom of God without God is through His feature as insurmountable time. It is said, "Spare the rod and spoil the child." That is a fact, and it is actually the Lord's mercy that He takes the trouble to rectify our misbehavior, although faithless persons criticize the Lord's fatherly vigilance.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> History is filled with examples of the supreme authority breaking the conceit of foolish men. Modern world leaders proudly fight one another, placing the common people in unprecedented jeopardy. Similarly Indra, proud of his apparently illustrious position, dared to threaten the lives of the innocent residents of Våndävana with terrible weapons, until his arrogance was curbed by the dynamic response of the Supreme Lord. Nowadays, governments in the Western countries tend to be elected democratically, and thus the mass of people become identified with the destiny of their leaders. When the proud leaders engage in violence, the people who elected them bear the brunt of such belligerent decisions. Thus the people in the democratic nations of the world should elect Kåñëa conscious leaders, who will establish an administration consonant with the laws of God. If they fail to do so, their materialistic leaders, oblivious of the will of the Supreme Lord, will undoubtedly be chastised by cataclysmic events, and the people who elected such leaders, being responsible for their leaders' acts, will share in the suffering.</div>
<div class="First"> It is ironic that in modern democracies not only do the leaders consider themselves universal controllers, but the mass of people, considering the leaders merely their representatives rather than the representatives of God, also consider themselves, as a people, to be the controllers of their nation. Thus the chastisement mentioned in this verse has become unprecedentedly applicable to people in general in the modern world.</div>
<div class="First"> Modern man should not simply make himself a lesson of nature by falling down from his proud position; rather he should submissively execute the will of the all-attractive Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, Çré Kåñëa, and usher in a new era of sanity, tranquillity and widespread enlightenment.</div>

<div class="First"> Although Lord Kåñëa protected the residents of Vraja by lifting Govardhana Hill, He had not yet punished Indra himself, and Indra feared that at any moment Çré Kåñëa might call the son of Vivasvän, Yamaräja, who punishes impudent persons who defy the laws of God.</div>
<div class="First"> Indra was quite fearful and thus begged the Lord's forgiveness on the plea that he could be purified only by Kåñëa's mercy—that he was too stubborn to learn a good lesson through mere punishment.</div>
<div class="First"> In fact, despite Indra's humility in this case, his heart was not completely purified. Later on in this canto we find that when Lord Kåñëa once took a pärijäta flower from Indra's kingdom, poor Indra again reacted violently against the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus, we should aspire to go back to our eternal home in the kingdom of Kåñëa, and should not become entangled in the imperfect life of the material gods.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> This verse utilizes an attractive poetic device. Lord Kåñëa's descent into the world is said to be for the abhava, literally "nonexistence" or "destruction," of the demoniac warlords, and simultaneously for the bhava, or "existence, prosperity," of those who faithfully serve the Lord's lotus feet. True existence, indicated here by the word bhava, is sac-cid-änanda, eternal and full of bliss and knowledge. To an uninformed observer, it may appear that Çré Kåñëa is simply rewarding His followers and punishing His enemies the way any ordinary person might do. This specific doubt about the Lord is raised extensively in the Sixth Canto in connection with Kåñëa's taking the side of the faithful demigods against the faithless demons in a particular cosmic war. In that canto the Vaiñëava authorities clearly explain that in fact Lord Kåñëa is the father and Lord of all living beings and that all His activities are therefore meant for the benefit of all existence. Lord Kåñëa does not really cause the nonexistence of anyone; rather He curbs the foolish, destructive, material ways of those who defy the laws of God. These laws are created to ensure the prosperity, harmony and happiness of the entire creation, and their violation is an unjustifiable disturbance.</div>
<div class="First"> Certainly Indra hoped that Lord Kåñëa would count him among the devotees and not the demons, although considering Indra's actions one might doubt where his loyalties actually lay. Indra was aware of this possible doubt and thus, as we find in the next verse, he tried his best to surrender to the Supreme Lord.</div>

<div class="First"> We could hardly construe from the first line of this verse that God is somehow impersonal but assumes a personal material body. It is clearly said here that the Lord assumes different forms according to svacchanda—according to His own desire or according to the desires of His devotees. An impersonal God could hardly reciprocate with the personal desires of Its devotees, nor could an impersonal God Itself have desires, since desire is characteristic of personality. Therefore, the Lord's manifesting different forms in a personal way, responding to personal desires, indicates that He is eternally a person and manifests His different transcendental bodies as an expression of His own eternal nature.</div>
<div class="First"> The word viçuddha-jïäna-mürtaye is most significant. Mürti means the form of the Deity, and it is specifically stated here that the Lord's form is itself completely pure consciousness. Consciousness is the primary spiritual element, distinct from any of the material elements, and even distinct from the subtle or psychological material elements—mundane mind, intelligence and false ego—which are simply a psychic covering over pure consciousness. Since the Lord's form is made of pure consciousness, it can hardly be understood as a material body like the mortal bags of flesh and bones we carry around in this world.</div>
<div class="First"> In the last two lines of this verse, there is poetic emphasis on the word sarva, "everything." The Lord is everything: He is the seed of everything and He is the Soul of every creature. Therefore, let us join with Indra in offering our obeisances to the Lord.</div>

<div class="First"> According to Çrédhara Svämé, Indra and Lord Kåñëa here exchange a heart-to-heart talk. Indra revealed his mind to the Lord, and now Lord Kåñëa similarly reveals His own intention.</div>
<div class="First"> In Text 11 of this chapter, Indra emphatically declared that Lord Kåñëa is in fact everything, and thus, according to Indra's own criteria, forgetting Lord Kåñëa is clearly a state of insanity.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> One may argue, "God should desire everyone's real welfare; therefore why should Lord Kåñëa state in this verse that He removes the intoxicating opulence of one who is about to receive His mercy, rather than simply stating that He will remove everyone's opulence and bless everyone?" On the other hand, we may point out that irrevocable death occurs for everyone, and thus Lord Kåñëa does take away everyone's opulence and everyone's false pride. However, if we apply the Lord's statement to events within one's immediate life, before death, we may refer to Kåñëa's statement in the Bhagavad-gétä (4.11): ye yathä mäà prapadyante täàs tathaiva bhajämy aham. "As people surrender to Me, I reward them accordingly." Lord Kåñëa desires everyone's welfare, but when He says here yasya cecchämy anugraham, "for one whose welfare I desire," it is understood that the Lord refers to those who by their own activities and thoughts have manifested a desire to achieve spiritual benefit. Lord Kåñëa wants everyone to be happy in Kåñëa consciousness, but when He sees that a specific person also desires spiritual happiness, the Lord especially desires it for that person. This is a natural act of reciprocation consistent with the Lord's statement samo 'haà sarva-bhüteñu: "I am equal in My attitude to all living beings." (Bg. 9.29)</div>

<div class="First"> Varuëa</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter describes how Lord Kåñëa brought Nanda Mahäräja back from the abode of Varuëa and how the cowherd men saw Vaikuëöha. The king of the cowherds, Nanda Mahäräja, observed the prescribed fast on the eleventh day of the lunar month and then considered how to break his fast properly on the twelfth day. By circumstance only a few more minutes remained, and so he decided to take his bath at the very end of the night, although astrologically that was an inauspicious time. Thus he entered the water of the Yamunä. A servant of Varuëa, the demigod of the ocean, noticed Nanda Mahäräja entering the water at a time forbidden by scripture and took him away to the demigod's abode. In the early morning the cowherd men unsuccessfully searched for Nanda, but Lord Kåñëa immediately understood the situation and went to see Varuëa. Varuëa worshiped Kåñëa with great and variegated festivity. Afterwards he begged the Lord to forgive his servant for having foolishly arrested the king of the cowherds.</div>
<div class="First"> Nanda was amazed to see the influence Çré Kåñëa exerted in the court of Varuëadeva, and after returning home he described his experiences to his friends and relatives. They all thought Kåñëa must be the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself and wanted to see His supreme abode. Thereupon the omniscient Personality of Godhead arranged for them to bathe in the same lake where Akrüra would have his vision of the Absolute Truth. There the Lord revealed to them Brahmaloka, which is realized by great sages in their mystic trance.</div>

Thus he entered the water to bathe at an inauspicious time, before the first dawn light. The servant of Varuëa who arrested Nanda Mahäräja is stated here to be an asura, or demon, for obvious reasons. First, the servant was foolishly ignorant of Nanda Mahäräja's position as the pastime father of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Also, Nanda Mahäräja's intention was to carry out the injunctions of scripture; therefore Varuëa's servant should not have arrested Nanda on the technical grounds that he bathed in the Yamunä at an inauspicious time. Later in this chapter Varuëa himself will say, ajänatä mämakena müòhena: "This was done by my ignorant servant, who is a fool." This foolish servant did not understand the position of Kåñëa or Nanda Mahäräja or devotional service to the Lord.</div>
<div class="First"> In conclusion, it is clear that Lord Kåñëa wanted to give His personal audience to Varuëa and simultaneously accomplish other didactic purposes. Thus this wonderful pastime will now unfold.</div>

Çréla Çrédhara Svämé points out that the word brahmaëe here indicates the Lord is full in Himself, and that the term paramätmane indicates He is the controller of all living entities. Thus within the supreme being, complete in Himself and omnipotent, we do not find any jurisdiction of the material, illusory energy.</div>

<div class="First"> Technically, Nanda Mahäräja was correct in entering the water just before sunrise. The following explanation is given by Çréla Jéva Gosvämé in his commentary on the first verse of this chapter: After an especially short Ekädaçé, measuring only eighteen hours, about six hours of the lunar day in which the fast had to be broken, namely the Dvädaçé, had already expired before the dawn. Since at sunrise the proper time for breaking the fast would have passed, Nanda Mahäräja decided to enter the water at an otherwise inauspicious time.</div>
<div class="First"> Of course, Varuëa's servant should have been aware of these technical details, which are meant for strict followers of the Vedic rituals.

<div class="Translation"> [Lord Kåñëa thought:] Certainly people in this world are wandering among higher and lower destinations, which they achieve through activities performed according to their desires and without full knowledge. Thus people do not know their real destination.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has elaborately explained how this verse applies to the eternally liberated residents of Çré Våndävana, the Lord's abode. One of the fundamental philosophical principles of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam is the distinction between two types of illusion, Yoga-mäyä and Mahä-mäyä, the spiritual and material states of existence, respectively. Although Kåñëa is God, the omnipotent, omniscient Supreme Being, His intimate associates in the spiritual world love Him so much that they see Him as their beloved child, friend, lover and so on. So that their ecstatic love can transcend the boundaries of mere reverence, they forget that Kåñëa is the Supreme God of all the universes, and thus their pure, intimate love expands unlimitedly. One may consider their activities of treating Kåñëa as a helpless child, a handsome boyfriend, or a playmate to be a manifestation of avidyä, ignorance of Lord Kåñëa's position as God, but the residents of Våndävana are in fact ignoring the secondary majesty of Kåñëa and focusing intensely on His infinite beauty, which is the essence of His existence.</div>
<div class="First"> In fact, describing Lord Kåñëa as the supreme controller and God is almost a type of political analysis, referring as it does to a hierarchy of power and control. Such analysis of levels of power and hierarchies of rule is significant in a context in which one entity is not fully surrendered, in love, to a higher entity. In other words, control becomes visible, or is consciously felt as control, when there is resistance to that control. To cite a simple example: A pious, law-abiding citizen sees a policeman as a friend and well-wisher, whereas a criminal sees him as a threatening symbol of punishment. Those who are enthusiastic about government policies feel not that the government is controlling them but rather that it is helping them.</div>
<div class="First"> Thus Lord Kåñëa is seen as a "controller," and hence as "the Supreme God," by those who are not fully enchanted by His beauty and pastimes. Those fully in love with Lord Kåñëa focus on His sublime, attractive features and, because of the nature of their relationship with Him, do not much notice His controlling power.</div>
<div class="First"> A simple proof that the residents of Vraja have transcended lower states of God consciousness rather than failed to attain them is the fact that throughout the pastimes of the Lord they often "remember" that Kåñëa is God. Usually they are astonished at this remembrance, having been fully absorbed in seeing Kåñëa as their friend, lover and so on.</div>
<div class="First"> The word käma is conventionally used to indicate a material desire, or else a spiritual desire so intense that it becomes somehow analogous to intense material desires. Still, the fundamental distinction remains: material desire is selfish and self-gratificatory; spiritual desire is free of selfishness, being wholly for the pleasure of the other, the Lord. Thus the residents of Våndävana executed their daily activities solely for the pleasure of their beloved Kåñëa. It should be remembered that the entire purpose of Kåñëa's descent into this world is to attract living beings back home, back to Godhead. Two things are required for this: that His pastimes display the beauty of spiritual perfection, and that they somehow seem relevant and hence interesting to the conditioned souls of this world. The Bhägavatam often states that Lord Kåñëa plays just like a youthful actor, and He undoubtedly engages His eternal devotees in the dramatic presentation. Thus Lord Kåñëa here muses to Himself that people in this world certainly do not know their ultimate destination, and with an obvious touch of the facetious He also thinks in this way about His own eternally liberated associates, who were playing in this world like ordinary members of a cowherd village.</div>
<div class="First"> Apart from the double meaning obviously present in this verse when it is applied to Kåñëa's liberated associates, Kåñëa here makes an entirely direct and pointedly critical observation about ordinary people. When applied to conditioned souls who are actually wandering throughout the universe, His statement that people are acting out of ignorance and lust is not mitigated by any deeper, spiritual meaning. People in general are simply ignorant, and they do not seriously consider their ultimate destination. As usual, Lord Çré Kåñëa is able to say many profound and complex things in a few simple words. How fortunate we are that God is not a dry field of energy, a transcendent, effulgent blob, or nothing at all—as various people would have it. In fact, He is the most wonderful Personality of Godhead, full of absolute personal qualities, and certainly whatever we can do, He can do better, as evidenced by His brilliant way of speaking.</div>

For example, if we want to show the moon to a child, we say, "Look up in the sky. See the moon over there in the sky." Similarly, Lord Kåñëa revealed the vast spiritual sky to the residents of Våndävana, but as emphasized in Text 14 and in the following text, 16, the actual destination of the Lord's associates was His own spiritual planet.</div>

Lord Kåñëa submerged the cowherd men in that lake in the sense that He submerged them in the awareness of the impersonal Brahman. But then, as indicated by the word uddhåtäù, He lifted them up to a higher understanding, that of the Personality of Godhead in His own planet. As clearly stated here, dadåçur brahmaëo lokam: They saw, just as Akrüra did, the transcendental abode of the Absolute Truth. The evolution of consciousness may be briefly summarized as follows: In ordinary consciousness we perceive and are attracted to the variety of material things. Rising to the first stage of spiritual consciousness, we transcend material variety and focus instead on the undifferentiated One, which lies behind and gives existence to the many. Finally, rising to Kåñëa consciousness, we find that the absolute, spiritual One contains its own eternal variety. In fact, since this world is a mere shadow of eternal existence, we would expect to find spiritual variety within the One, and indeed we do find it in the sacred text of Çrémad-Bhägavatam.</div>
<div class="First"> Astute readers may note that the pastime involving Akrüra takes place later in the Bhägavatam, after the present affair with the cowherd men. The reason Çukadeva Gosvämé says Akrüra saw Vaikuëöha purä, "previously," is that all these incidents took place many years before the conversation between Çukadeva Gosvämé and Mahäräja Parékñit.</div>

<div class="First"> Although the residents of Våndävana considered themselves ordinary persons, Lord Kåñëa wanted them to know of their extraordinary good fortune. Thus, within a lake in the Yamunä River the Lord showed them His personal abode. The cowherd men were amazed to see that the kingdom of God had exactly the same spiritual atmosphere as their own earthly Våndävana and that, just as in their Våndävana Lord Kåñëa was personally present, in their unique vision He was present as the Lord of the spiritual world. As Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura points out, these verses emphasize that Lord Kåñëa did not merely show the cowherd men a sample Vaikuëöha planet but that He specifically revealed His Kåñëaloka, the greatest of eternal abodes and the natural home of the residents of Våndävana, who loved Kåñëa more than anyone else did.</div>
<div class="First"> Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Twenty-eighth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Kåñëa Rescues Nanda Mahäräja from the Abode of Varuëa."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 29. Kåñëa and the Gopés Meet for the Räsa Dance</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter describes how Lord Çré Kåñëa, intending to enjoy the räsa dance, engaged in arguments and counterarguments with the gopés. Then there is a description of the beginning of the räsa dance and the Lord's pastime of disappearing from the midst of the gopés.</div>
<div class="First"> Remembering the promise He had made to the gopés when He had stolen their clothes, Lord Kåñëa employed His Yogamäyä potency and manifested within Himself the desire to enjoy pastimes during an autumn night. Thus He began to play His flute. When the gopés heard the flute's sound, the impulses of Cupid were violently aroused within them, and they immediately abandoned all their household duties and hastily went to Kåñëa. All the gopés had purely spiritual bodies, but when some of the gopés' husbands and other family members stopped the young girls from going, Lord Kåñëa arranged for them to temporarily exhibit material bodies, which they then left at the sides of their husbands. In this way they deceived their relatives and went off to meet Kåñëa. When the gopés came before Lord Kåñëa, He asked, "Why have you come? It is not good for you to travel to such a place in the dead of the night, for this forest is full of violent creatures. Your husbands and children will soon come searching after you to bring you home and engage you again in your household duties. After all, the prime religious duty of a woman is to serve her husband and children. For a respectable woman to consort with a paramour is totally contemptible and sure to obstruct her progress to heaven. Moreover, one develops pure love for Me not by physical proximity but by hearing topics connected with Me, by viewing My Deity form in the temple, by meditating upon Me and by faithfully chanting My glories. Therefore, all of you would do best to return home."</div>
<div class="First"> The gopés were crestfallen to hear this, and after crying a little they replied, with a bit of anger, "It is very unfair for You to reject young girls who have abandoned everything in their lives and come to You with the exclusive desire to serve You. By serving our husbands and children we receive only pain, whereas by serving You, the dearmost Soul of all living beings, we will perfectly fulfill the true religious duty of the self. What woman will not deviate from her prescribed duties as soon as she hears Your flute song and sees Your form, which enchants the three worlds? Just as the Supreme Lord Viñëu protects the demigods, You destroy the unhappiness of the people of Våndävana. Therefore You should immediately relieve the torment we have felt because of separation from You." Wanting to please the gopés, Lord Kåñëa, who is always satisfied in Himself, responded to their appeals by playing with them in various pastimes. But when this show of attention made them a little proud, He humbled them by suddenly disappearing from the arena of the räsa dance.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> As we begin the famous narration of Lord Kåñëa's räsa dance, a dance of love with beautiful young girls, questions will inevitably arise in the minds of ordinary people regarding the propriety of God's romantic dancing with many young girls in the middle of a full-moon autumn night. In his description of the Lord's räsa dance in Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çréla Prabhupäda painstakingly explains the spiritual purity of these transcendental activities. Those advanced in the science of Kåñëa—the great teachers, or äcäryas—leave no doubt that Lord Kåñëa is full and satisfied in Himself, free of all material desire, which is, after all, a sense of incompleteness or lack. Materialistic persons and impersonal philosophers stubbornly reject the bona fide explanation of Çré Kåñëa's transcendental nature. There is no reason to deny the beautiful reality of an absolute person able to perform absolute romantic activities, of which our so-called romance is merely a shadow or perverted reflection. The irrational insistence that material activities cannot be a reflection of the perfect, spiritual activities performed by God reflects the unimaginative emotional disposition of those who oppose the reality of Çré Kåñëa. This psychological disposition of the nondevotees, which leads them to fervently deny the very existence of the absolute person, unfortunately boils down to what may be succinctly described as envy, since the overwhelming majority of the impersonal critics eagerly pursue their own romantic affairs, which they consider quite real and even "spiritual."</div>
<div class="First"> The actual supreme lover is Lord Kåñëa. The Vedänta-sütra begins by declaring that the Absolute Truth is the source of everything, and even Western philosophy was born in a somewhat awkward attempt at finding the original One behind the apparent many of material existence. Conjugal love, one of the most intense and demanding aspects of human existence, can hardly have nothing at all to do with supreme reality. In fact, the conjugal love experienced by human beings is a mere reflection of spiritual reality, in which the same love exists in an absolute, pristine state. Thus it is clearly stated here that when Kåñëa decided to enjoy the romantic atmosphere of autumn, "He resorted to His spiritual potency" (yoga-mäyäm upäçritaù). The spiritual nature of Lord Kåñëa's conjugal affairs is a major theme in this section of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam.</div>
<div class="First"> A woman is attractive because of the sweet sound of her voice, her beauty and gentleness, her enchanting fragrance and tenderness, and also because of her cleverness and skill in music and dance. The most attractive ladies of all are the young gopés of Våndävana, who are Lord Kåñëa's internal potency, and this chapter tells how He enjoyed their brilliant feminine qualities—even though, as Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has mentioned, Lord Kåñëa was an eight-year-old boy when these events took place. Ordinary people prefer God simply to be a witness of their romantic affairs. When a boy desires a girl or a girl desires a boy, sometimes they pray to God for their enjoyment. Such people are shocked and dismayed to find out that the Lord can enjoy His own loving affairs with His own transcendental senses. In truth, Çré Kåñëa is the original Cupid, and His exciting conjugal pastimes will be described in this section of the Bhägavatam.</div>
<div class="First"> When Lord Kåñëa descends to the earth, His spiritual body seems to take birth and grow as He displays His variegated pastimes. The Lord could hardly allow His boyhood to pass without exhibiting the supreme loving affairs between a young boy and young girls. Thus Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura quotes Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé as follows: kaiçoraà saphalé-karoti kalayan kuïje vihäraà hariù. "Lord Hari perfects His youth by arranging loving pastimes in the groves of the Våndävana forest."</div>

The song of His flute entered through the ears of the gopés, into the inner treasure chamber of their hearts. That wonderful music stole all their most valuable possessions—their sobriety, shyness, fear and discrimination, along with their very minds—and in a split second this music delivered all these goods to Kåñëa.

<div class="First"> Throughout the Tenth Canto, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura gives elaborate poetic commentaries on Lord Kåñëa's pastimes. It is not always possible to include these extensive descriptions, but we will quote in its entirety his comments on this verse. It is our sincere recommendation to the learned Vaiñëava community that a qualified devotee of the Lord present the entire commentary of Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté on the Tenth Canto as a separate book, which will undoubtedly be appreciated by devotees and nondevotees alike. The äcärya's comments on this verse are as follows: "In this context we will make our analysis according to the method described in Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé's Ujjvala-nélamaëi. There are two categories of gopés: the eternally perfect (the nitya-siddhas) and those who have become perfect by practicing bhakti-yoga (the sädhana-siddhas). The sädhana-siddhas are of two categories: those who belong to special groups and those who do not. And there are also two classes of the gopés belonging to special groups: namely the çruti-cärés, who come from the group of the personified Vedas, and the åñi-cärés, who come from the group of sages who saw Lord Rämacandra in the Daëòakäraëya forest.</div>
<div class="First"> "This same fourfold categorization of the gopés is given in the Padma Puräëa:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">gopyas tu çrutayo jïeyä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">åñi-jä gopa-kanyakäù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">deva-kanyäç ca räjendra</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na mänuñyäù kathaïcana</div>
<div class="First"> 'It is understood that some of the gopés are personified Vedic literatures, while others are reborn sages, daughters of cowherds, or demigod maidens. But by no means, my dear King, are any of them ordinary humans.' Here we are informed that although the gopés appeared to be human cowherd girls, they actually were not. Thus the contention that they are mortals is refuted. "The daughters of cowherds, referred to here as gopa-kanyäs, must be eternally perfect, since we never hear of them having executed any sädhana. Their apparent sädhana of worshiping goddess Kätyäyané in the role of gopés merely manifests their manner of playing like human beings, and the Bhägavatam narrates the account of this worship only to show how they had fully taken on the role of cowherd girls.</div>
<div class="First"> "That the gopa-kanyä gopés are actually nitya-siddhas, eternally perfect devotees of the Lord, is established by a statement in Brahma-saàhitä (5.37)—änanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhävitäbhiù—which proves that they are the Lord's spiritual pleasure potency. Similarly, we have the words of the Gautaméya-tantra, hlädiné yä mahä-çaktiù. Further corroboration of their eternal perfection is that these gopés, being coeternal with Lord Kåñëa, their lover, are mentioned along with Him in the eighteen-syllable mantra, the ten-syllable mantra and others, and also that the worship of these mantras, and also the çrutis that present them, have been in existence since beginningless time."</div>
<div class="First"> The deva-kanyäs, daughters of the demigods, who are mentioned in the verse beginning sambhavas tv amara-striyaù, are explained in Çré Ujjvala-nélamaëi as partial expansions of the gopés who are eternally perfect. That the çruti-cäré gopés, the personified Vedas, are sädhana-siddha is understood from the following words of theirs quoted in the Båhad-vämana Puräëa:</div>

<div class="First"> "The åñi-cäré gopés are also sädhana-siddha, as stated in Ujjvala-nélamaëi: gopälopäsakäù pürvam apräptäbhéñöa-siddhayaù. Previously they were all mahärñis living in the Daëòaka forest. We find evidence for this in the Padma Puräëa, Uttara-khaëòa:</div>

<div class="First"> This verse says that upon seeing Lord Rämacandra, the sages in the Daëòaka forest desired to enjoy Lord Hari (Kåñëa). In other words, the sight of Lord Räma's beauty reminded them of Lord Hari, Gopäla, their personal object of worship, and they then wanted to enjoy with Him. But out of embarrassment they did not act on that desire, whereupon Lord Çré Räma, who is like a desire tree, gave His mercy to them, even though they had not voiced their request. Thus their desire was fulfilled, as stated by the words beginning te sarve. By means of their lusty attraction they became freed from the ocean of material existence, the cycle of birth and death, and coincidentally they got the association of Hari in conjugal love.</div>
<div class="First"> "In the present verse of the Bhägavatam we understand that it was the gopés who had children who were kept forcibly at home. This fact is clear from verses yet to come: mätaraù pitaraù puträù (SB 10.29.20), yat-paty-apatya-suhådäm anuvåttir aìga (SB 10.29.32) and pati-sutänvaya-bhrätå-bändhavän (SB 10.31.16). In his comments on the Tenth Canto, Çréla Kavi-karëapüra Gosvämé mentions this fact. Without trying to repeat all his thoughts on this verse, we will give the gist of his purport: " 'Upon seeing the personal form of Lord Çré Rämacandra, the sages who were worshipers of Lord Gopäla immediately became elevated to the mature platform of spontaneous devotion, automatically reaching the stages of firm faith, attraction and attachment. But they had not yet completely freed themselves of all material contamination; therefore Çré Yogamäyä-devi arranged for them to take birth from the wombs of gopés and become cowherd girls. By associating with the eternally perfect gopés, some of these new gopés fully manifested pürva-raga loving attraction for Kåñëa as soon as they reached puberty (This kind of attraction develops even before one meets the beloved.) When these new gopés got the direct audience of Kåñëa and physically associated with Him, all their remaining contamination became burned up, and they achieved the advanced stages of prema, sneha and so on. " 'Even though they were in the company of their cowherd husbands, by the power of Yogamäyä the gopés remained unsullied by sexual contact with them; rather, they were situated in purely spiritual bodies that Kåñëa enjoyed. On the night they heard the sound of Kåñëa's flute, their husbands tried to stop them, but by the merciful assistance of Yogamäyä the sädhana-siddha gopés were able to go forth to their beloved, together with the nitya-siddha gopés. " 'Other gopés, however, because of not getting the good fortune of associating with the nitya-siddha gopés and other advanced gopés, had not achieved the stage of prema, and so their contamination was not completely burned away. They entered the company of their cowherd husbands and, after sexual union with them, gave birth to children. But a short time later even these gopés developed their pürva-raga by hankering intensely for the physical association of Kåñëa—a hankering they acquired by associating with the advanced gopés. Becoming worthy recipients of the mercy of the perfected gopés, they assumed transcendental bodies fit to be enjoyed by Kåñëa, and when Yogamäyä failed to help them overcome their husbands' attempts to keep them from going out, they felt themselves cast into the worst calamity. Viewing their husbands, brothers, fathers and other family members as enemies, they came close to dying. Just as other women might remember their mothers or other relatives at the time of death, these gopés remembered the sole friend of their very life, Kåñëa, as stated in the present verse of the Bhägavatam, beginning with the word antar.</div>
<div class="First"> " 'It is implied that those ladies were not able to exit because they were held back by their husbands, who were standing before them with sticks in their hands, scolding them. Although these gopés were perpetually absorbed in love for Kåñëa, at that particular time they meditated upon Him and cried out within: "Alas, alas, O only friend of our life! O ocean of the artistic skills of Våndävana forest! Please let us become your girlfriends in some future life, because at this time we cannot see Your lotuslike face with our eyes. So be it; we shall look upon You with our minds." Each of them lamenting to herself in this way, the gopés stood with their eyes shut and meditated deeply upon Him.'"</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> For those gopés who could not go to see Kåñëa, intolerable separation from their beloved caused an intense agony that burned away all impious karma. By meditating upon Him they realized His embrace, and the ecstasy they then felt exhausted their material piety. Although Lord Kåñëa is the Supreme Soul, these girls simply thought of Him as their male lover and associated with Him in that intimate mood. Thus their karmic bondage was nullified and they abandoned their gross material bodies.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté comments upon this verse as follows: "Here Çukadeva Gosvämé speaks in a peculiar way: he presents the intimate object the gopés attained as if it were an external idea, thus keeping its true nature secret from outsiders, while at the same time he reveals to the confidential devotees well versed in the scientific conclusions of devotional service the internal meaning that is his real purport. Thus to outsiders Çukadeva says that Kåñëa gave the gopés liberation, but to the confidential hearers Çukadeva reveals that when the gopés experienced separation from their beloved there arose in them both immeasurable unhappiness and immeasurable happiness, and that they gradually achieved their desired goal.</div>
<div class="First"> "Thus the verse can be understood as follows: Because of their intolerable separation from their beloved, the gopés felt terrible agony, by which they caused all inauspicious things to tremble. In other words, when people in general hear of the gopés' extreme agony in separation from their beloved, they abandon thousands of inauspicious things—things even as fearsome as the subterranean fires of millions of universes or the powerful poison swallowed by Lord Çiva. More specifically, those who hear of the gopés' love in separation give up their terrible false ego and, thinking themselves defeated, are shaken. When the gopés meditated on Lord Acyuta, He became manifest and personally came to them, and they experienced great joy by embracing His body, which was full of transcendental love for them. The gopés also experienced great joy by exhibiting personal characteristics and a sense of identification appropriate to such love. That joy made all their good fortune, both material and spiritual, seem paltry by comparison. "The implication is that when other persons see how happy the gopés became upon embracing Kåñëa when He manifested Himself directly before them, these other persons feel that thousands of so-called auspicious objects are insignificant by comparison, including all the sense gratificatory pleasures found in millions of universes and even the supersensory pleasure of spiritual bliss (brahmänanda) . Thus hearing of the gopés' distress and the joy that arose, respectively, out of their separation from the Supreme Lord and their union with Him, anyone can get rid of all the reactions of his past activities, both sinful and pious. Vaiñëavas certainly do not think that sinful and pious reactions can be destroyed only by being lived out, since, after all, neither separation from the Supreme Lord nor direct association with Him are in the category of karma. This kind of elimination of karmic reactions occurs in the stage of bhajana, for those who have come to the level of anartha-nivåtti. "And thus the gopés thought of Kåñëa—the Paramätmä, or supreme worthy object of all love—as their paramour. Even though such a concept is ordinarily contemptible, the gopés realized Kåñëa in an even fuller sense than did Rukmiëé and His other queens, who thought of Him most respectfully as their husband. That thinking of the Lord as one's paramour is superior to thinking of Him as one's husband is proved by the fact that unbridled pure love is superior to domesticated love. This idea is borne out by the following words of Çré Uddhava: yä dustyajaà sva-janam ärya-pathaà ca hitvä. 'These ladies of Vraja abandoned their families and their advanced religious principles, even though to do so is very difficult.' (SB 10.47.61)</div>
<div class="First"> "In His pastimes on earth Kåñëa often turns the most lowly things into the most elevated. As Bhéñma stated, Kåñëa's pastime of acting as Arjuna's chariot driver was even more elevated than the pastimes in which He acted as a mighty King of kings: vijaya-ratha-kuöumba ätta-totre/ dhåta-haya-raçmini tac-chriyeskñaëéye. 'I concentrate upon the chariot driver of Arjuna, who stood with a whip in His right hand and a bridle rope in His left, and who was very careful to protect Arjuna's chariot by all means.' (SB 1.9.39) Similarly, in the Lord's appearance as Kåñëa we see that the normally inferior conjugal räsa becomes better than the normally superior mood of çänta-rasa, as also the attitude of loving a paramour becomes superior to the loving exchange between legitimate spouses, and lowly guïjä necklaces, red oxide paste and peacock feathers become better than the most excellent jeweled ornaments. "But, it may be objected, it is not fitting for the Supreme Lord to sport with women whose bodies have already been enjoyed by other men. This objection is replied to by the words beginning jahuù. The word deham is used here in the singular form to indicate unity of category, even though the gopés are many. Some authorities say that by the power of Yogamäyä these gopés' bodies disappeared in a way no one noticed, but other authorities say that the 'body' referred to in this context is the inferior body, composed of the modes of material nature. Thus by the prominence of the adjective guëa-mayam, it is understood that before the gopés heard the sound of Kåñëa's flute their bodies had been twofold, material and spiritual, and upon hearing the flute they gave up the material bodies, which their husbands had enjoyed. We may analyze this as follows:</div>
<div class="First"> "When devotees begin prosecuting devotional service in accordance with the instructions of a bona fide spiritual master, they engage their ears and other senses in pure devotion by hearing of the Lord, chanting His glories, remembering Him, offering obeisances to Him, giving Him personal attendance, and so forth. Thus the devotees make the Lord's transcendental qualities the objects of their senses, as stated by the Lord Himself: nirguëo mad-apäçrayaù. (SB 11.25.26) In this way the devotees' bodies transcend the material modes. Yet sometimes the devotees may take as their sense objects mundane sounds and so on, and that is material. Thus a devotee's body can have two aspects, transcendental and material.</div>
<div class="First"> "According to one's level of devotional service, to that degree the transcendental aspects of one's body become prominent and the material aspects diminish. This transformation is described in the following verse from the Bhägavatam (11.2.42):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhaktiù pareçänubhavo viraktir</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">anyatra caiña trika eka-kälaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">prapadyamänasya yathäçnataù syus</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tuñöiù puñöiù kñud-apäyo 'nu-ghäsam</div>
<div class="First"> 'Devotion, direct experience of the Supreme Lord, and detachment from other things—these three occur simultaneously for one who has taken shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in the same way that pleasure, nourishment and relief from hunger come simultaneously and increasingly, with each bite, for a person engaged in eating.' When one achieves totally pure love of God, the material portions of the body disappear and the body becomes completely spiritual. Nonetheless, so as not to disturb the false opinions of atheists and so as to protect the confidentiality of devotional service, the Supreme Lord usually has His illusory energy exhibit the demise of the gross body. An example of this is the disappearance of the Yädavas during the Mauñala-lélä. "Sometimes, however, to proclaim the excellence of bhakti-yoga, Kåñëa will allow a devotee to go back to Godhead in his selfsame body, as in the case of Dhruva Mahäräja. We can cite evidence for this point from the Twenty-fifth Chapter of the Eleventh Canto, Text 32:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yeneme nirjitäù saumya</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">guëä jévena citta-jäù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhakti-yogena man-niñöho</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mad-bhäväya prapadyate</div>
<div class="First"> 'A living entity who conquers the modes of material nature, which are manifested from the mind, can dedicate himself to Me [Kåñëa] by the process of devotional service and thus attain pure love for Me.' Here the Lord states that the defeat and destruction of that which is composed of the modes of material nature can be brought about only by the process of devotional service. "Therefore, what we should understand from the present verse of the Bhägavatam is that the gopés who could not go to see Kåñëa had their inauspicious, material bodies removed or burned up, while their auspicious, spiritual bodies, far from being destroyed, simply grew more prominent because of the ecstasy the gopés felt by embracing Kåñëa in meditation. Thus their bondage was completely destroyed: by the help of Yogamäyä they got free from ignorance and also from the prohibitions of their husbands and other relatives. "We should not make the mistake of explaining this falling away of the gopés' bodies as being a result of their dying. As the Lord Himself states (SB</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">10.47.37),</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yä mayä kréòatä rätryäà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">vane 'smin vraja ästhitäù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">alabdha-räsäù kalyäëyo</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mäpur mad-vérya-cintayä</div>
<div class="First"> 'Some of those all-auspcious gopés could not directly join Me in enjoying the räsa dance on that night in this Våndävana forest, yet still they achieved My association by remembering My transcendental pastimes.' By using the word kalyäëyaù in this verse, the Lord implies, 'Even though these gopés wanted to give up their bodies because of their husbands' prohibitions and the torment of separation from Me, for them to die at the very beginning of the most auspicious festival of the räsa dance would have been displeasing to Me and thus inauspicious. So they did not die.'</div>
<div class="First"> "More evidence that the gopés who were prevented from going to see Kåñëa did not physically die is provided by a statement of Çré Çukadeva's later in this canto (10.47.38): tä ücur uddhavaà prétäs tat-sandeçägata-småtéù. 'Then they [the gopés] replied to Uddhava, feeling satisfied because His message had reminded them of Kåñëa.' Here we understand that the gopés speaking to Uddhava were the ones who had not had the chance to participate directly in the räsa dance because of being held captive in their homes. Thus the conclusion is that they gave up their material bodies without dying. Parched by the intense heat of separation, their material bodies gave up their materiality and became purely spiritual, just like the bodies of such great devotees as Dhruva Mahäräja. This is the meaning of the gopés' 'giving up their bodies.' "The following analogy illustrates the statuses of the various gopés: By observing seven or eight ripe mangoes on a tree, we can ascertain that all the fruits on the tree are ripe. Then we can pick them all and bring them home, where in due course the sun's rays and other agents will make them fine—looking, fragrant and delicious—fit to be offered to the king for his enjoyment. When the time comes for the king to take his meal, a discriminating servant can choose those fruits ready to offer him. From the appearance of the fruits the servant can tell which are ripe in the middle but still raw on the outside and thus not yet fit for the king. By the application of a special heating process, these remaining fruits will become ripe in two or three days, and then they too will be ready to offer to the king. "Similarly, among the muni-cäré gopés who took birth in Gokula, those who completely gave up the materiality of their bodies and very early in life achieved purely spiritual bodies were able to remain untouched by any other man; thus Yogamäyä allowed them to join the nitya-siddha and other advanced gopés when they went to meet Kåñëa. Other muni-cäré gopés still retained some connection with the external material body, but even they, after being parched by the heat of separation from Çré Kåñëa, gave up the materiality of their bodies and assumed perfectly transcendental bodies, purified of all taint of contact with other men. On the night of the räsa dance, Yogamäyä sent some of these gopés out behind those who had already gone out; others, who Yogamäyä saw still had a slight amount of contamination, she kept back to further purify with the heat of separation, and then she sent them out on some other night.</div>
<div class="First"> "After enjoying the pleasures of the räsa dance and other pastimes with Kåñëa, the muni-cäré gopés who had participated went back to their homes when the night was over, as did the nitya-siddha and other advanced gopés. But now Yogamäyä protected these muni-cäré gopés from the material association of their husbands; in other words, these gopés were devoid of any selfish attachment for husband, children and so on. Since these gopés were thoroughly immersed in the great ocean of love for Kåñëa, their breasts dried up so that they could not feed their infants, and to their family members they appeared as if haunted by ghosts. In conclusion, it is not unseemly that the gopés who were previously in material association joined in the räsa dance. "Some authorities, however, maintain that the gopés who were kept back in their houses did not have children. According to them, whenever such words as apatya ('children') are used in verses yet to come, these words refer to the children of co-wives, to adopted children or to nephews and nieces."</div>

<div class="First"> Although the spiritual nature of conditioned souls may be covered by illusion, Lord Kåñëa's spiritual nature is omnipotent and is never covered by any other power. In fact, all other powers are His energy and thus function according to His will. The Brahma-saàhitä (5.44) states, såñöi sthiti-pralaya-sädhana-çaktir ekä/ chäyeva yasya bhuvanäni bibharti durgä/ icchänurüpam api yasya ca ceñöate sä: "The mighty Durgä, who creates, maintains and annihilates the material worlds, is the potency ot the Supreme Lord, and she moves like His shadow, according to His desire." Thus because the Lord's spiritual influence does not depend on whether someone understands Him or not, the gopés' spontaneous love for Kåñëa guaranteed their spiritual perfection.</div>

<div class="First"> Since Lord Kåñëa descends to benefit mankind in general, why would He neglect innocent young girls who loved Him more than anyone else did? Although the Lord awards Himself to His pure devotees, He is avyaya, inexhaustible, because He is aprameya, immeasurable. He is also nirguëa, free of material qualities, and thus those who intimately associate with Him are on the same spiritual platform. He is guëätmä, the controller or original personality behind the modes of nature, and it is specifically for this reason that He is free of them. In other words, because the modes of nature are His energy, they cannot act upon Him.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Persons who constantly direct their lust, anger, fear, protective affection, feeling of impersonal oneness or friendship toward Lord Hari are sure to become absorbed in thought of Him.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa is pure spiritual existence, and those who somehow or other become attached to Him, absorbed in thoughts of Him, rise to the spiritual platform. This is the absolute nature of the Lord's personal association. With this verse Çukadeva Gosvämé answers King Parékñit's question about the gopés. After all, Çukadeva has begun to narrate Kåñëa's most intimate pastime, the räsa dance, and Parékñit is cooperating to remove the doubts of others who are hearing or who in the future may hear this astonishing story. Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted a statement from the Skanda Puräëa that emphatically declares persons like the gopés to be liberated souls, beyond the pale of material illusion:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhaktyä hi nitya-kämitvaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na tu muktià vinä bhavet</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ataù kämitayä väpi</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">muktir bhaktimatäà harau</div>
<div class="First"> "Eternal conjugal attraction to Kåñëa, expressed in pure devotional service, cannot develop in one who is not already liberated. Thus those who are devoted to Lord Hari, even in conjugal attraction, are already liberated . "Çréla Madhväcärya then quotes from the Padma Puräëa to clarify the essential point that one cannot be liberated simply by lusting after Lord Kåñëa but rather only by possessing conjugal attraction in pure devotional service:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sneha-bhaktäù sadä deväù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kämitsenäpsara-striyaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">käscit käscin na kämena</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhaktyä kevalayaiva tu</div>
<div class="First"> "The demigods are always affectionately devoted to the Lord, and the young ladies of heaven called Apsaräs have lusty feelings toward Him, although some of them have pure devotion for Him untainted by material lust. Only these latter Apsaräs are ready for liberation, because without bona fide devotional service one cannot possibly achieve liberation."</div>
<div class="First"> Thus devotional service is not yogyam, or appropriate, unless free from material lust. One should not take cheaply the gopés' achievement of personal association with Lord Kåñëa in a conjugal relationship. To show the gravity of direct relationship with the Lord, Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted the following verses from the Varäha Puräëa:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">patitvena çriyopäsyo</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">brahmaëä me piteti ca</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">pitämahatayänyeñäà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tridaçänäà janärdanaù</div>
<div class="First"> "The goddess Lakñmé worships Lord Janärdana as her husband, Lord Brahmä worships Him as his father, and the other demigods worship Him as their grandfather."</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">prapitämaho me bhagavän</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">iti sarva-janasya tu</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">guruù çré-brahmaëo viñëuù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">suräëäà ca guror guruù</div>
<div class="First"> "Thus people in general should think, 'The Supreme Lord is my great-grandfather.' Lord Viñëu is the spiritual master of Brahmä and thus the guru of the guru of the demigods."</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">gurur brahmäsya jagato</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">daivaà viñëuù sanätanaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ity evopäsanaà käryaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nänyathä tu kathaïcana</div>
<div class="First"> "Brahmä is the spiritual master of this universe, and Viñëu is the eternally worshipable Deity. With this understanding, and not otherwise, one should worship the Lord."</div>
<div class="First"> The above injunctions apply to sarva-jana, "all people in general." Thus one should follow these injunctions until one achieves the exalted platform of intimate relationship with the Supreme Lord. There is abundant evidence that the gopés of Våndävana were highly elevated, liberated souls, and thus their pastimes with Kåñëa are pure, spiritual affairs. Keeping this in mind, we can truly understand this chapter of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam .</div>

<div class="First"> Parékñit Mahäräja should not have been so astonished that Lord Kåñëa's so-called romantic affairs are in fact meant to liberate the entire universe. After all, that is the Lord's purpose—to bring all conditioned souls back home, back to Godhead, for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge. The Lord's conjugal affairs with the gopés fit in very nicely with that program because we who are actually lusty in material consciousness can be purified and liberated by hearing of them.</div>

<div class="Translation"> This night is quite frightening, and frightening creatures are lurking about. Return to Vraja, slender-waisted girls. This is not a proper place for women.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has written the following charming commentary on this verse:</div>
<div class="First"> "[The gopés thought,] 'Alas, alas, even after shattering our family responsibilities, our sobriety and our shame and enjoying us day after day, and after now dragging us here by the sound of His flute, He is asking us why we have come!'</div>
<div class="First"> "As the gopés cast sidelong glances at one another, the Lord said, 'If you try to tell Me that you have come to get night-blooming flowers to use in the worship of God, and that it is these flowers you are looking at with your sidelong glances, I will have to reject your excuse as unacceptable, since neither the time, place nor persons involved are appropriate.' "This is the Lord's meaning in the verse beginning rajané. He might have said, 'Even though there is abundant moonlight, this time of night is very fearsome because many snakes, scorpions and other dangerous creatures too small for you to see are lying beneath the creepers, roots and twigs. Therefore this time is unsuitable for gathering flowers. And not only the time but also this place is unsuitable for you to gather flowers, because at night terrible creatures such as tigers are abroad here. Therefore you should go back to Vraja.'</div>
<div class="First"> " 'But,' the gopés may object, 'let us just rest for a few minutes, and then we will go.'</div>
<div class="First"> "Then the Lord might reply, 'Women shouldn't remain in this kind of place.' In other words, 'Because of the time and place, it is wrong for persons like yourselves to stay here even for a moment.'</div>
<div class="First"> "Furthermore, by the word su-madhyamäù, 'O slender-waisted ones,' the Lord implied, 'You are beautiful young girls, and I am a beautiful young boy. Because you are all very chaste and I am a brahmacäré, as confirmed by the words kåñëo brahmacäré in the çruti [Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad], there should be no fault in our being in the same place. Nonetheless, the mind can never be trusted-neither yours nor My own.'</div>
<div class="First"> "The Lord's inner eagerness thus hinted at is obvious if we read His words between the lines, as follows: 'If out of shyness you cannot tell Me the reason you've come, then don't speak. I already know it anyway, so just listen as I tell it to you.' Thus the Lord speaks the words beginning rajané . " The following statement by Kåñëa is based on an alternative meaning of the verse derived when the Sanskrit words are separated in a different way. The alternative separation, according to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté, would be rajané eñä aghora-rüpä aghora-sattva-niñevitä/ pratiyäta vrajaà na iha stheyaà stribhiù su-madhyamäù. Through Çréla Viçvanätha's commentary Kåñëa now explains the meaning of this division of words.</div>
<div class="First"> " 'The pervasive moonshine has made this night appear not at all fearsome, and therefore this forest is populated by harmless creatures such as deer (aghora-sattvaiù), or else by animals such as tigers that are harmless because of Våndävana's naturally nonviolent atmosphere. Consequently this night should not frighten you.' Or else Kåñëa may have meant, 'You should not be afraid of your own husbands and other relatives because, the night being populated by fearsome animals, they will not come near this place. Therefore please do not go back to Vraja [na pratiyäta], but stay here in My company [iha stheyam].' "The gopés may ask the Lord, 'How are You staying here?' "The Lord answers, 'With women.'</div>
<div class="First"> "But are You satisfied to keep just any women in Your company?' "The Lord replies to this with the word su-madhyamäù, meaning, 'Only women who are young and beautiful, who have slender waists—namely yourselves—should stay here with Me, and not others.' Thus we can appreciate that Kåñëa's statements are full of considerate as well as neglectful sentiments." Kåñëa's words are certainly brilliant, because according to the rules of Sanskrit grammar they may be understood in either of two opposite ways. In the first case, as translated above, Lord Kåñëa continues to tease the gopés by telling them the night is dangerous and inauspicious and that they should go home. But Kåñëa is simultaneously saying exactly the opposite—namely, that there is absolutely no reason for the gopés to fear coming to the Lord, that the night is quite auspicious and that the girls should under no circumstances go back home. Thus Lord Kåñëa simultaneously teases and enchants the gopés with His words.</div>

O chaste ladies, serve your husbands and give milk to your crying babies and calves.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura further explains Text 22 as follows: "Lord Kåñëa says, 'Therefore don't wait a long time before going, but go immediately.' The word satéù means that the gopés are loyal to their husbands; therefore Kåñëa indicates that the gopés should serve their husbands so the latter can accomplish their religious duties, and that the gopés should also be considered worshipable because of their chastity. All this Kåñëa says to the gopés who are married. And now to the unmarried girls He says, 'The calves are crying, so see to it that they get milk.' To the muni-cäré gopés He says, 'Your babies are crying, so feed them milk.' "</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura further reveals the hidden meaning of these two verses as follows: "In Text 21 Kåñëa might have said, 'This Våndävana is the very best of places, and moreover this is a full-moon night. Furthermore, we have the Yamunä on all sides, and there are cool, gentle, fragrant breezes blowing. These are all transcendental opulences that stimulate loving exchanges, and since I am also here as the foremost ecstatic opulence—the object of love—let us now test how much expertise you can show in relishing rasas.'</div>
<div class="First"> "In Text 22 He means to say, 'Thus for a long time, for the entire duration of this night, don't leave, but rather stay here and enjoy with Me. Don't go serve your husbands and the gentle women—your mothers-in-law and so forth. It would not be fitting for you to waste such beauty and youth, which are gifts of the creator. Nor should you milk the cows or give milk to the calves and babies. What do you, who are so full of ecstatic attraction for Me, have to do with these affairs?' "</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura also explains that the gopés could not really be sure exactly what Kåñëa was doing—whether He was merely joking, inviting them to stay or instructing them to return home. Thus as Çré Kåñëa spoke about the beauty of the forest, the gopés felt embarrassed and bewildered and looked upward at the trees, and as He spoke about the Yamunä they looked all around at the river. Their absolute purity and simplicity, along with their absolute devotion to Lord Kåñëa in the conjugal mood, created the most beautiful pastimes ever exhibited in this universe.</div>

<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté quotes a similar statement from småti-çästra: patià tv apatitaà bhajet. "One should serve a master who is not fallen." Sometimes the foolish argument is given that even if a husband falls down from spiritual principles, his wife should continue to follow him since he is her "guru." In fact, since Kåñëa consciousness cannot be subordinated to any other religious principle, a guru who engages his follower in materialistic, sinful activities loses his status as a guru. Çréla Prabhupäda stated that the system of monarchy collapsed in Europe because the monarchs abused and exploited their position. Similarly, in the Western world men have abused and exploited women, and now there is a popular movement in which women reject the authority of their husbands. Ideally, men should be staunch in spiritual life and give pure, sincere guidance to the women under their care. The gopés, of course, being on the highest platform of spiritual perfection, were transcendental to all positive and negative religious considerations. In other words, they were the eternal lovers of the Absolute Truth.</div>

<div class="First"> "O King, one who has given up all material duties and has taken full shelter of the lotus feet of Mukunda, who offers shelter to all, is not indebted to the demigods, great sages, ordinary living beings, relatives, friends, mankind or even one's forefathers who have passed away. Since all such classes of living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, one who has surrendered to the Lord's service has no need to serve such persons separately." Authority descends from the author of all existence, the Supreme Lord. Natural figures of authority such as husbands, mothers, government leaders and sages gain their power and authority from the Supreme Lord and should thus represent the Absolute Truth to those who follow them. If one wholeheartedly engages in loving service to the original, Supreme Truth, one need not indirectly serve the Absolute Truth through the above-mentioned secondary authorities. Even a soul surrendered to God, however, continues to serve the spiritual master, who is a direct, not an indirect, representative of the Supreme Lord. A bona fide äcärya, or spiritual master, is the transparent medium leading the disciple to the lotus feet of Kåñëa. All indirect authorities become obsolete when one is directly in touch with the Absolute Truth. The gopés wanted to explain this basic point to Kåñëa, and some of the bolder young girls among them attempted to defeat Çré Kåñëa with His own statements, as exemplified in this verse.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> When Çré Kåñëa was born, the sage Garga predicted that He would manifest all the opulences of the Supreme Lord Näräyaëa. The gopés now appeal to the Lord to fulfill this prediction by being merciful and granting them direct service, just as Lord Näräyaëa awards direct service to His loving devotees. The gopés emphasize that they did not give up their families and homes with the hope of securing a higher pleasure from Kåñëa. They are simply begging for service, revealing their pure-hearted devotion. The gopés think, "If in the course of Your pursuing Your happiness we somehow or other become happy by seeing Your face, what is the harm in that?"</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté comments on the words puruña-bhüñaëa, "O jewel among men." The Öhäkura states that the gopés meant to say, "O jewel of all males, please decorate our golden bodies with the dark blue gems of Your limbs."</div>

<div class="First"> "Kåñëa says, 'You want to become My servants; so do I have to buy you with some payment, or are you giving yourselves freely?'</div>
<div class="First"> The gopés reply, " 'Since the beginning of our youthful womanhood You have been purchasing us with a payment millions and millions of times more than enough. That payment is Your gemlike smiling glance, which constitutes a great treasure we have never heard about or seen anywhere else.' " 'When You put Your golden turban on Your head, Your maidservant will act as Your valet, pulling up the turban bit by bit until it is in just the right position. And even while You shake a chastising finger at her, trying hard to prohibit her, she will put her hand beneath Your turban and take the opportunity to glance at Your face. Thus we, Your maidservants, will relish with our eyes Your abundant sweetness.'</div>
<div class="First"> "Kåñëa says, 'Your husbands will not tolerate this behavior of ours. They will complain bitterly to King Kaàsa, thus producing a fearful situation for Me and for you as well.'</div>

<div class="First"> " 'O dear crest jewel of religious personalities, You may say that You refuse to make the cowherds' wives Your maidservants, but by force You have already taken Lakñmé, the wife of Näräyaëa, from Vaikuëöha and are carrying her around on Your chest. Out of shame she has assumed the form of a golden line on Your chest, and she takes her only pleasure there. " 'Besides, within all the fourteen worlds and even above these worlds—in Vaikuëöhaloka, beyond this universe—You never reject any beautiful woman, no matter who she is or whom she belongs to.

<div class="First"> The word prasädäya here is significant. Lord Kåñëa was not going to neglect the gopés; rather, He would increase the power of their loving affairs by making another spectacular arrangement. After all, the gopés were basically proud of Kåñëa. He also made this arrangement, as we shall see, to show special favor to the beautiful young daughter of King Våñabhänu . Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A . C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Twenty-ninth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Kåñëa and the Gopés Meet for the Räsa Dance."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 30. The Gopés Search for Kåñëa</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter describes how the gopés, tormented through the long night by separation from Kåñëa, wandered like madwomen from forest to forest in search of Him.</div>
<div class="First"> When Çré Kåñëa suddenly disappeared from the arena of the räsa dance, the gopés, their minds fully absorbed in thoughts of Him, began looking for Him in the various forests. From all the moving and nonmoving creatures they asked for news of Kåñëa's whereabouts. Finally they became so distraught that they began imitating His pastimes.</div>
<div class="First"> Later, while wandering in a corner of the forest, the gopés saw Çré Kåñëa's footprints, which appeared mixed with Çrématé Rädhäräëé's. Seeing these footprints perturbed them greatly, and they declared that surely Çrématé Rädhäräëé must have worshiped Kåñëa with unusual excellence, since She had been privileged to associate with Him in seclusion. Further along the path the gopés came to a place where they could no longer see Çrématé Rädhäräëé's footprints; they then concluded that Kåñëa must have taken Rädhäräëé onto His shoulders. In another place they noticed that Kåñëa's footprints were showing only the toes, and thus the gopés concluded He had been picking flowers with which to decorate His beloved. In yet another spot the gopés saw signs that led them to imagine that Çré Kåñëa had been tying the locks of Çrématé Rädhäräëé's hair. All these thoughts brought pain to the gopés' minds. Because of the special attention She received from Kåñëa, Çré Rädhä began to consider Herself the most fortunate of women. She told Him that She could walk no further and that He would have to carry Her on His shoulders. But just then Lord Kåñëa disappeared from Her sight. Çrématé Rädhäräëé, extremely troubled, then began looking everywhere for Him, and when She finally met Her gopé girlfriends She related to them what had happened. All the gopés then went out to look for Kåñëa in the forest, going as far as the moonlight reached. But in the end they were unsuccessful, so they went back to the shore of the Yamunä and simply sang Kåñëa's glories in utter helplessness.</div>

The gopé, defeated by the words of Kåñëa, laughed and then gave Him her lips as honey to drink."</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté also describes the following conversation: "Kåñëa said to a gopé, 'Ah, I can understand that as you approached this népa tree standing here, you were bitten by an audacious snake.

<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté explains the thoughts of the gopés as follows: " 'Perhaps the trees and plants [mentioned in the previous verses] did not hear our question because they were in trance, meditating on Lord Viñëu.

Anyway, what is the use of unnecessarily criticizing the residents of a holy place? We cannot tell if they really know where Kåñëa has gone. So let us find someone who definitely knows where He is.' Thus the gopés concluded that since Lord Kåñëa had to be somewhere on the earth, the earth herself must know His whereabouts.</div>
<div class="First"> "Then the gopés thought, 'Since Kåñëa always walks on the earth, she is never separated from Him and thus cannot understand how much His parents, girlfriends and servants suffer in His absence.

<div class="First"> "The gopés spoke to a doe, 'O friend, wife of the deer, from the bliss in your clear eyes we can tell that Çré Kåñëa has expanded your joy with the beauty of His limbs, His face and so forth. You are eager to realize the ecstasy of seeing Kåñëa, and thus your eyes are following Him. In fact, He is never lost to you.' "Then the gopés, seeing the doe continue to walk in her natural way, exclaimed, 'Oh, are you telling us that you have seen Kåñëa? Look! As this deer walks she constantly turns her head back to us; as if to say, "I will show Him to you; just follow me and I will show you Kåñëa." In this merciless Våndävana, she is the only merciful person.'</div>
<div class="First"> "As the gopés follow the doe they happen to lose sight of her, and they cry out, 'Oh, why can't we see the deer who is showing us the way to Kåñëa?' "One gopé suggests that Kåñëa must be somewhere in the vicinity and that the deer, being afraid of Him, must have hidden herself to avoid the possible mistake of revealing His presence. Conjecturing in this way, the gopés detect a fragrance that has by chance blown their way, and they repeatedly declare with great joy, 'Yes! Yes! This is it! By Kåñëa's physical contact with His girlfriend, His jasmine garland was smeared with the kuìkuma powder on Her breasts, and the fragrances of all these things are reaching us.' Thus the gopés smelled the aroma of the two lovers' bodies, of Kåñëa's jasmine garland, and of the cosmetic powder on the breasts of His lover."</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">vajraà vai dakñiëe pärçve</div>

<div class="First"> 'A thunderbolt is found on the right side of His right foot, and an elephant goad below that.'</div>
<div class="First"> "The äcäryas of the Vaiñëava sampradäya explain that since the particular feet under discussion are Lord Kåñëa's, we should know that the thunderbolt is at the base of His small toe and the elephant goad below the thunderbolt. An elephant goad on the heel belongs rather to Lord Näräyaëa and other viñëu-tattva expansions.</div>
<div class="First"> "Thus the Skanda Puräëa describes six marks on Kåñëa's right foot—the disc, flag, lotus, thunderbolt, elephant goad and barleycorn. And the Vaiñëava-toñaëé mentions even more marks—a vertical line beginning at the middle of His foot and continuing as far as the juncture between His big toe and second toe; an umbrella below the disc; at the base of the middle of His foot, a group of four svastikas in the four cardinal directions; at the four points where each svastika meets the next, four rose apples; and in the middle of the svastikas, an octagon. This makes eleven marks on Kåñëa's right foot." Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté describes the marks on Kåñëa's left foot as follows: "At the base of the large toe is a conchshell with its mouth facing the toe. At the base of the middle toe are two concentric circles, representing the inner and outer sky. Below this mark is Cupid' s unstrung bow, at the base of the bow is a triangle, and surrounding the triangle is a group of four waterpots. At the base of the triangle is a half-moon with two more triangles touching its points, and below the half-moon is a fish.</div>

<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté explains that the word ärädhitaù refers to Çrématé Rädhäräëé. He comments, "The sage Çukadeva Gosvämé has tried with all endeavor to keep Her name hidden, but now it automatically shines forth from the moon of his mouth. That he has spoken Her name is indeed Her mercy, and thus the word ärädhitaù is like the rumbling of a kettledrum sounded to announce Her great good fortune."</div>
<div class="First"> Although the gopés spoke as if jealous of Çrématé Rädhäräëé, they were actually ecstatic to see that She had captured Çré Kåñëa. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté quotes the following detailed description of Çrématé Rädhäräëé's footprints, as given by Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé in his Çré Ujjvala-nélamaëi: "At the base of the large toe of Her left foot is the mark of a barleycorn, below that mark is a disc, below the disc is an umbrella, and below the umbrella is a bracelet. A vertical line extends from the middle of Her foot to the juncture of Her large and second toes. At the base of the middle toe is a lotus, below that is a flag with a banner, and below the flag is a creeper, together with a flower. At the base of Her small toe is an elephant goad, and upon Her heel is a half-moon. Thus there are eleven marks on Her left foot. "At the base of the large toe of Her right foot is a conchshell, and below that a spear. At the base of the small toe of Her right foot is a sacrificial altar, below that an earring, and below the earring a spear. Along the base of the second, third, fourth and small toes is the mark of a mountain, below which is a chariot, and on the heel is a fish.</div>
<div class="First"> "Thus all together there are nineteen distinguishing marks on the soles of Çrématé Rädhäräëé's lotus feet."</div>

<div class="First"> According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté, who quotes from çästra, each day in the late afternoon, as Kåñëa returned from the cow pastures with His cowherd boyfriends, great demigods like Brahmä and Çiva would come down from heaven and take the dust of His feet.</div>
<div class="First"> Great personalities like the goddess Ramä (the wife of Viñëu), Çiva and Brahmä are not at all sinful. But in the ecstasy of pure Kåñëa consciousness they feel themselves fallen and impure. Thus, desiring to purify themselves, they blissfully take the dust of the Lord's lotus feet on their heads.</div>

<div class="First"> The word vadhüm indicates that even though Çré Kåñëa was not officially married to Rädhäräëé, He had in fact made Her His bride in the Våndävana forest.</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the gopés use the word käminaù here to indicate the following thoughts: "We actually love Çré Kåñëa, but still He has rejected us. Therefore His private dealings with Rädhäräëé prove that this young prince of Vraja has carried Her away because of lust. If He were interested in love, He would have accepted us instead of that cowherd girl Rädhäräëé."</div>
<div class="First"> These thoughts reveal the mood of the gopés who are rivals of Çrématé Rädhäräëé. Of course, the gopés who are Her direct allies were jubilant to see Her good fortune.</div>

Therefore They sat down together facing the same direction, with Rädhäräëé between Kåñëa's knees, and Kåñëa proceeded to arrange Her hair with flowers and make a flower crown for Her, coronating Her as the goddess of the forest. Thus the romantic young boy and girl played and joked together in Våndävana.</div>

<div class="Translation"> [Çukadeva Gosvämé continued:] Lord Kåñëa enjoyed with that gopé, although He enjoys only within, being self-satisfied and complete in Himself. Thus by contrast He showed the wretchedness of ordinary lusty men and hardhearted women.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> This verse directly refutes the superficial criticism materialistic people sometimes direct against Lord Kåñëa's pastimes. The philosopher Aristotle claimed that ordinary activities are unworthy of God, and with this idea in mind some people declare that since the activities of Lord Kåñëa resemble those of ordinary human beings, He cannot be the Absolute Truth . But in this verse Çukadeva Gosvämé emphatically points out that Lord Kåñëa acts on the liberated platform of spiritual self-satisfaction. This fact is indicated here by the terms ätma-rata, ätmäräma and akhaëòita. It is inconceivable to ordinary people that a handsome young boy and a beautiful young girl enjoying romantic conjugal affairs in the forest moonlight can be engaging in pure activity, free from egoistic desire and lust. Yet while Lord Kåñëa is inconceivable to ordinary persons, those who love Him can easily realize the absolute, pure nature of His activities.</div>
<div class="First"> One may argue that "beauty is in the eye of the beholder" and that therefore the devotees of Kåñëa are only imagining the Lord's activities to be pure. This argument ignores many significant facts. For one, the path of Kåñëa consciousness, of developing love for Kåñëa, demands that a devotee strictly follow four regulative principles: no illicit sex, no gambling, no intoxication and no eating of meat, fish or eggs. When one is freed from material lust and rises to the liberated platform, beyond material desire, one realizes the absolute beauty of Lord Kåñëa. This process is not theoretical: it has been practiced and completed by many thousands of great sages, who have left us their shining example and their brilliant teachings concerning the path of Kåñëa consciousness.</div>
<div class="First"> Certainly beauty is in the eye of the beholder. However, real beauty is perceived by the soul's eye and not by the lusty eye of the material body. Therefore the Vedic literature repeatedly stresses that only those freed from material desire can see the beauty of Lord Kåñëa with the eye of the pure soul, anointed with love of Godhead. It may finally be noted that upon realizing the pastimes of Lord Kåñëa one becomes free of all tinges of sex desire, a state of mind that can hardly result from meditating upon material sexual affairs. One final note: The conjugal pastimes of Kåñëa perfectly round out His qualification as the Supreme Absolute Truth. The Vedänta states that the Absolute Truth is the source of everything, so certainly the Absolute cannot lack any of the beautiful things of this world. It is only because romantic affairs exist in a pure, spiritual form in the Absolute that they can manifest in a perverted, material form in this world. Thus the apparent beauty of this world is not to be absolutely rejected; rather, beauty should be accepted in its pure, spiritual form.</div>
<div class="First"> Since the beginning of time men and women have been inspired to poetic rapture by the art of romance. Unfortunately, romance in this world usually leads to crushing disappointment, brought about by a change of heart or by death. Thus although we may at first find romantic affairs beautiful and enjoyable, they are eventually spoiled by the onslaught of material nature. Still, it is unreasonable to totally reject the concept of romance. Rather, we should accept conjugal attraction in its absolute, perfect, pure form, as it exists within God, without a tinge of material lust or selfishness. That pure conjugal attraction—the supreme beauty and pleasure of the Supreme Truth—is what we are reading about here in the pages of Çrémad-Bhägavatam.</div>

<div class="Translation"> As the gopés wandered about, their minds completely bewildered, they pointed out various signs of Kåñëa's pastimes. The particular gopé whom Kåñëa had led into a secluded forest when He had abandoned all the other young girls began to think Herself the best of women. "My beloved has rejected all the other gopés," She thought, "even though they are driven by Cupid himself. He has chosen to reciprocate with Me alone."</div>

Even with the greatest endeavor I cannot maintain My life. But You are the Lord of My life, and so You can quickly save Me simply by glancing upon Me. Please do so immediately. I beg You to save My life, not for My sake but rather for Yours. After giving up all the other gopés, You've brought Me so far to a secluded place in the forest just to enjoy special pleasure with Me. If I die You will not be able to find conjugal happiness anywhere else. You will remember Me and thus lament in Your sorrow.'</div>

<div class="First"> This chapter relates how the gopés, overwhelmed by feelings of separation from Kåñëa, sat down on the bank of the Yamunä and began praying for His audience and singing His glories.</div>
<div class="First"> Because the gopés had dedicated their minds and very lives to Kåñëa, they were beside themselves with the transcendental pain of separation. But their crying, which appears like evidence of misery, actually shows their exalted state of transcendental bliss. As it is said, yata dekha vaiñëaver vyavahära duùkh/ niçcaya jäniha sei paramänanda sukh: "Whenever one sees a Vaiñëava acting unhappy, one should know it for sure that he is actually experiencing the highest spiritual bliss." Thus each of the gopés began addressing Lord Çré Kåñëa according to her individual mode of ecstasy, and they all prayed for Him for His mercy.</div>
<div class="First"> As the pastimes of Kåñëa spontaneously arose in the minds of the gopés, they sang their song, which relieves the agony of those suffering from the burning pain of separation from Kåñëa and which bestows supreme auspiciousness. They sang, "O Lord, O lover, O cheater, when we remember Your smile, Your loving glances and Your pastimes with Your boyhood friends, we become extremely agitated. Remembering Your lotus face, adorned with locks of blackish hair smeared with the dust of the cows, we become irrevocably attached to You. And when we remember how You followed the cows from forest to forest with Your tender feet, we feel great pain." In their separation from Kåñëa the gopés considered a single moment an entire age. Even when they had previously seen Him they had found the blinking of their eyelids intolerable, for it blocked their vision of Him for a fraction of a second.</div>
<div class="First"> The ecstatic sentiments for Lord Kåñëa that the gopés expressed may appear like symptoms of lust, but in reality they are manifestations of their pure desire to satisfy the Supreme Lord's spiritual senses. There is not even the slightest trace of lust in these moods of the gopés.</div>

The gopés are not victims of material lust, but rather they are absorbed in pure love of Godhead and thus want to serve Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet by offering their beautiful breasts to Him. Materialistic persons, who are victims of mundane sex desire, will not be able to understand how these conjugal dealings take place on a pure, spiritual platform, and that is the materialists' great misfortune.</div>

<div class="First"> The translation of this verse is from Çréla Prabhupäda's English rendering of Caitanya-caritämåta (Ädi 4.173).</div>
<div class="First"> Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Thirty-first Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Gopés' Songs of Separation."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 32. The Reunion</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter describes how Çré Kåñëa manifested Himself in the midst of the gopés, who had become extremely disturbed by their separation from Him. After He consoled them, they expressed to Him their deep feelings of ecstasy. The gopés having shown in various ways their great eagerness to see Kåñëa, the attractor of Cupid, He appeared before them wearing silken yellow garments and a beautiful flower garland. Some of the gopés, overwhelmed with ecstasy at seeing Him, grasped His hands, others placed His arm on their shoulders, and others accepted the remnants of betel nut He had chewed. Thus they served Him.</div>
<div class="First"> One gopé, impelled by loving anger toward Kåñëa, bit her lip and looked askance at Him. Because the gopés were so attached to Kåñëa, they were not satiated even by continuously gazing at Him. One of them then placed Kåñëa within her heart, closed her eyes and, embracing Him within herself again and again, became absorbed in transcendental bliss, just like a yogé. In this way the pain the gopés had felt because of separation from the Lord was dispelled. Next Lord Kåñëa went to the bank of the Yamunä in the company of the cowherd girls, His internal potencies. The gopés then made a seat for Kåñëa out of their shawls, and after He had sat down they enjoyed with Him by gesturing amorously. The gopés still felt hurt that Kåñëa had disappeared, so He explained to them why He had done so. He further told them that He had come under the exclusive control of their loving devotion and would ever remain indebted to them.</div>

<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura states that the seven gopés mentioned so far in this chapter are the first seven of the eight principal gopés, whose status allowed them to immediately approach Çré Kåñëa upon His reappearance. The äcärya quotes a verse from the Çré Vaiñëava-toñaëé that gives the names of these seven as Candrävalé, Çyämalä, Çaibyä, Padmä, Çré Rädhä, Lalitä and Viçäkhä. The eighth is understood to be Bhadrä. Çré Vaiñëava-toñaëé itself quotes a verse from the Skanda Puräëa that declares these eight gopés to be the principal among the three billion gopés. Detailed information about the hierarchy of gopés is available in Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé's Ujjvala-nélamaëi.</div>
<div class="First"> The Padma Puräëa confirms that Çré Rädhä is the foremost of the gopés:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yathä rädhä priyä viñëos</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">sarva-gopéñu saivaikä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">viñëor atyanta-vallabhä</div>
<div class="First"> "Just as Çrématé Rädhäräëé is most dear to Kåñëa, Her bathing pond is similarly dear. Of all the gopés, She is the most beloved of the Lord." The Båhad-gautaméya-tantra also names Çrématé Rädhäräëé as Kåñëa's foremost consort:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">devé kåñëa-mayé proktä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">rädhikä para-devatä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sarva-lakñmé-mayé sarva</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">käntiù sammohiné parä</div>
<div class="First"> "The transcendental goddess Çrématé Rädhäräëé is the direct counterpart of Lord Çré Kåñëa. She is the central figure for all the goddesses of fortune. She possesses all attractiveness to attract the all-attractive Personality of Godhead. She is the primeval internal potency of the Lord." (This translation is Çréla Prabhupäda's English rendering of Caitanya-caritämåta, Ädi 4.83.) Additional information about Çré Rädhä is given in the Åg-pariçiñöa (the supplement to the Åg Veda): rädhayä mädhavo devo mädhavenaiva rädhikä/ vibhräjante janeñu. "Among all persons, it is Çré Rädhä in whose company Lord Mädhava is especially glorious, as She is especially glorious in His."</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa states in Bhagavad-gétä, ye yathä mäà prapadyante täàs tathaiva bhajämy aham: [Bg. 4.11] "As people approach Me, I reciprocate with them accordingly." Yet even if the Lord is approached by someone with devotion, to intensify the devotee's love the Lord may not immediately reciprocate fully. In fact, the Lord is truly reciprocating. After all, a sincere devotee always prays to the Lord, "Please help me to love You purely." Therefore the Lord's so-called neglect is actually the fulfillment of the devotee's prayer. Lord Kåñëa intensifies our love for Him by apparently separating Himself from us, and the result is that we achieve what we really wanted and prayed for: intense love for the Absolute Truth, Kåñëa. Thus Lord Kåñëa's apparent negligence is actually His thoughtful reciprocation and the fulfillment of our deepest and purest desire.</div>
<div class="First"> According to the äcäryas, as Lord Kåñëa began to speak this verse the gopés looked at one another with squinting eyes, trying to hide the smiles breaking out on their faces. Even as Lord Kåñëa was speaking, the gopés had begun to realize that He was bringing them to the highest perfection of loving service.</div>

<div class="First"> The translation and word meanings for this verse are taken from Çréla Prabhupäda's English rendering of Çré Caitanya-caritämåta (Ädi 4.180). In conclusion, the gopés became eternally glorious by their behavior in the Lord's temporary absence, and the mutual love between them and the Lord was wonderfully enhanced. This is the perfection of Kåñëa and His loving devotees.</div>
<div class="First"> Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A . C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Thirty-second Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Reunion."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 33. The Räsa Dance</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter describes Lord Çré Kåñëa's räsa dance, which He enjoyed with His beloved girlfriends in the forests along the Yamunä River. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, is most expert in the knowledge of transcendental moods. In the company of the gopés, who were tightly bound to Him by the ropes of affection and totally dedicated to His service, the Lord expanded Himself into numerous forms. The gopés became intoxicated with their enthusiasm to enjoy the räsa dance, and thus they began satisfying Kåñëa's senses by singing, dancing and gesturing amorously. The sweet voices of the gopés filled all the directions. Even after Lord Kåñëa manifested Himself in numerous forms, each gopé thought He was standing next to her alone. Gradually the gopés became fatigued from the continuous dancing and singing, and each of them placed her arm on the shoulder of the Kåñëa standing beside her. Some gopés smelled and kissed Kåñëa's arm, which bore the fragrance of the lotus and was anointed with sandalwood paste. Others put Kåñëa's hand on their bodies, and yet others gave Kåñëa pleasure by embracing Him lovingly.</div>
<div class="First"> Lord Kåñëa, being the Supreme Absolute Truth, is the only actual enjoyer and object of enjoyment. Although He is one without a second, He expands Himself into many forms to increase His personal pastimes. Therefore great scholars say that Kåñëa's räsa-lélä is like a child's playing with His own reflection. Çré Kåñëa is self-satisfied and fully endowed with inconceivable, transcendental opulences. When He exhibits such pastimes as the räsa-lélä, all living beings, from Brahmä down to the blades of grass, become merged in the ocean of astonishment.</div>
<div class="First"> When Mahäräja Parékñit heard the narration of Kåñëa's conjugal pastimes with the gopés, which superficially resemble the activities of lusty, wanton persons, he expressed a doubt to the great devotee Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé. Çukadeva dispelled this doubt by stating, "Since Çré Kåñëa is the absolute enjoyer, such pastimes as these can never be contaminated by any fault. But if anyone other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead tries to enjoy such pastimes, he will suffer the same fate that someone other than Lord Rudra would suffer if he attempted to drink an ocean of poison. Moreover, even one who only thinks of imitating Lord Kåñëa's räsa-lélä will certainly suffer misfortune."</div>
<div class="First"> The Supreme Absolute Truth, Çré Kåñëa, is present within the hearts of all living entities as their indwelling witness. When out of His mercy He exhibits His intimate pastimes to His devotees, these activities are never besmirched by mundane imperfection. Any living being who hears of the spontaneous loving attraction the gopés felt for Lord Kåñëa will have his desires for material sense gratification destroyed at the root and will develop his natural propensity for serving the Supreme Lord, the spiritual master, and the Lord's devotees.</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">aìganäm aìganäm antarä mädhavo</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mädhavaà mädhavaà cäntareëäìganäù</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">saïjagau veëunä devaké-nandanaù</div>
<div class="First"> "Lord Mädhava was situated between each pair of gopés, and a gopé was situated between each pair of His manifestations. And Çré Kåñëa, the son of Devaké also appeared in the middle of the circle, playing upon His flute and singing." Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura points out that the gopés, maddened by love, were unable to understand that Çré Kåñëa had expanded Himself so He could personally dance with each of them. Each gopé saw one manifestation of Kåñëa. The demigods and their wives, however, could see all His different manifestations as they watched the räsa dance from their airplanes, and thus they were completely astonished.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> As stated here, Lord Kåñëa's glory in dancing the räsa dance is pure spiritual bliss. The demigods in heaven, in charge of maintaining propriety in the universe, ecstatically accepted the räsa dance as the ultimate religious affair, completely different from the perverted reflection of romance we find in this mundane world.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> As the gopés sang in praise of Kåñëa, their feet danced, their hands gestured, and their eyebrows moved with playful smiles. With their braids and belts tied tight, their waists bending, their faces perspiring, the garments on their breasts moving this way and that, and their earrings swinging on their cheeks, Lord Kåñëa's young consorts shone like streaks of lightning in a mass of clouds.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Çrédhara Svämé explains that according to the analogy of lightning flashing in clouds, the perspiration on the lovely faces of the gopés resembled drops of mist, and their singing resembled thunder. The word ägranthayaù may also be read agranthayaù, meaning "loosened." This would indicate that although the gopés began the dance with their hair and belts tightly drawn, these gradually slackened and loosened.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté points out that the gopés were expert at exhibiting mudräs (precise hand gestures that express feelings or convey meanings associated with the theme of a performance). Thus sometimes Kåñëa and the gopés would artistically move their interlocked arms together, and sometimes they would separate arms and exhibit mudräs to act out the meaning of the songs they were singing.</div>
<div class="First"> The word päda-nyäsaiù indicates that the gopés artistically and gracefully placed the steps of their dancing feet in an enchanting way, and the words sa-smitair bhrü-viläsair indicate that the romantic movements of their eyebrows, smiling with love, were most charming to behold.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Eager to enjoy conjugal love, their throats colored with various pigments, the gopés sang loudly and danced. They were overjoyed by Kåñëa's touch, and they sang songs that filled the entire universe.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to an authoritative book on music called Saìgéta-sära, tävanta eva rägäù süryävatyo jéva-jätayaù, teñu ñoòaça-sähasré purä gopé-kåtä varä: "There are as many musical rägas as there are species of life. Among these rägas are sixteen thousand principal ones, which were manifested by the gopés." Thus the gopés created sixteen thousand different rägas, or musical modes, and these have subsequently been disseminated throughout the world. The words yad-gétenedam ävåtam also indicate that even today devotees throughout the world sing the praises of Kåñëa, following the example of the gopés.</div>

<div class="Translation"> One gopé, joining Lord Mukunda in His singing, sang pure melodious tones that rose harmoniously above His.

<div class="First"> The previous verse states that Çré Kåñëa honored the gopés for their dancing and singing, and in this verse we see how the gopés responded by dealing intimately and confidently with Him. Here a tired gopé held on to Kåñëa's shoulder with her arm, resting against Him.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains that the word gadä in this verse indicates a baton suitable for a dancing master. Lord Kåñëa brought this item of paraphernalia to enhance His enjoyment of the räsa dance.

Just as the opulent manifestation of His one supreme transcendental potency manifests all the countless potencies of the Lord, so in the räsa dance Kåñëa manifests Himself as many times as there are various potencies represented by the gopés. Everything is Kåñëa, but by His desire His spiritual energy Yogamäyä manifests the gopés. When His internal potency Yogamäyä thus produces such pastimes for the enhancement of His transcendental emotions, it is just like a young boy playing with His own reflection.

These descriptions are never complete, however, since the Lord's pastimes are unlimited; thus the attempt to glorify such pastimes is still going on and will go on forever. Lord Kåñëa arranged an extraordinary season of beautiful autumn nights to enhance His loving affairs, and those autumn nights have inspired transcendental poets since time immemorial.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The statements of the Lord's empowered servants are always true, and the acts they perform are exemplary when consistent with those statements. Therefore one who is intelligent should carry out their instructions.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The word éçvara is usually defined in Sanskrit dictionaries as "lord, master, ruler," and also as "capable, potent to perform." Çréla Prabhupäda often translated the word éçvara as "controller," which brilliantly synthesizes the two fundamental concepts of éçvara, namely a master or ruler and a capable or potent person. A master may be incompetent, but a controller is a master or lord who in fact makes things happen. The parameçvara, the supreme éçvara, the supreme controller, is of course God, Kåñëa, the cause of all causes. Although people in general, especially in the Western countries, are not aware of the fact, powerful personalities control our universe. The modern, impersonal concept of the universe depicts an almost totally lifeless cosmos in which the earth floats meaninglessly. Thus we are left with the dubious "ultimate purpose" of preserving and reproducing our genetic code, which has its own "ultimate purpose" of adding another link to the meaningless chain of events by again reproducing itself.</div>
<div class="First"> In contrast to this sterile, meaningless world concocted by ignorant materialists, the actual universe is full of life—personal life—and in fact full of God, who pervades and supports all that exists. The essence of reality is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His personal relationship with the innumerable living beings, of whom we are samples. Some of the living beings are trapped in the illusion of materialism, or identification with the material body, while others are liberated, aware of their eternal, spiritual nature. A third class comprises those progressing in self-realization from the materialistic state of ignorance to the enlightened state of Kåñëa consciousness. Reality is ultimately personal and divine, and therefore it is not surprising that, as the Vedic literature reveals to us, our universe and other universes are managed by great personalities, just as our city, state and country are managed by empowered personalities. When we democratically award a particular politician the right to govern, we vote for him because he has exhibited something we call "leadership" or "ability." We think, "He'll get the job done." In other words, it is only after an individual acquires the power to govern that we vote for him; our vote does not make him a leader but rather recognizes a power in him coming from some other source. Thus, as Lord Kåñëa explains at the end of the Tenth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gétä, any living being exhibiting an extraordinary power, ability or authority must have been empowered by the Lord Himself or by the Lord's energy.</div>
<div class="First"> Those directly empowered by the Lord are devoted to Him, and thus their power and influence spread goodness throughout the world, whereas those who are empowered by the Lord's illusory potency are in an indirect relationship with Kåñëa because they do not directly reflect His will. Of course, they do reflect His will indirectly, since it is by Kåñëa's arrangement that the laws of nature act upon ignorant living beings, gradually persuading them, through their journey of many lifetimes, to surrender to the Supreme Lord. Thus as politicians create wars, false hopes and innumerable passionate schemes for the materialistic persons who follow them, the politicians are indirectly carrying out the Lord's program of allowing the conditioned souls to experience the bitter fruit of godlessness.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has translated the word éçvaräëäm as "those who have become powerful through knowledge and austerity." As one understands the nature and will of God and makes the personal sacrifice required to achieve excellence in spiritual life, one becomes empowered by the Supreme Lord to represent His will, which one has intelligently recognized and accepted.</div>
<div class="First"> The Supreme Personality of Godhead kindly descends to earth to show a vivid example of religious behavior. As Lord Kåñëa states in the Bhagavad-gétä (3.24), "If I did not execute standard duties, the whole world would be misled and in fact destroyed." Thus the Lord showed, in His different incarnations, how to act properly in this world. A good example is Lord Rämacandra, who behaved wonderfully as the son of King Daçaratha.</div>
<div class="First"> But when Lord Kåñëa Himself descends, He also demonstrates the ultimate religious principle, namely that the Supreme Lord is beyond all other living beings and that no one can imitate His supreme position. This foremost of all religious principles—that the Lord is unique, without equal or superior—was clearly demonstrated in Lord Kåñëa's apparently immoral pastimes with the gopés. No one can imitate these activities without incurring dire consequences, as explained here by Çukadeva Gosvämé. One who thinks that Lord Kåñëa is an ordinary living being subjected to lust, or who accepts His räsa dance as admirable and tries to imitate it, will certainly be vanquished, as described in Text 30 of this chapter.</div>
<div class="First"> Finally, a distinction must be made between the Lord and His empowered servants. An empowered servant of the Lord, as in the case of Brahmä, may experience a remnant of reactions to previous activities, according to the law of karma. But the Lord is eternally free from any entanglement in the laws of karma. He is on a unique platform.</div>

<div class="First"> Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains in this connection that when Lord Kåñëa descends to this world in His original two-handed form, out of kindness He manifests that form in a way His devotees conditioned in human society can perceive and understand. Thus here it is stated, mänuñaà deham ästhitaù: "He assumes a humanlike body." Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura glorifies the Lord's conjugal pastimes, stating that these romantic affairs have an inconceivable spiritual potency to attract the polluted heart of conditioned souls. It is an undeniable fact that any pure—or simple—hearted person who hears narrations of the loving affairs of Kåñëa will be attracted to the lotus feet of the Lord and gradually become His devotee .</div>

<div class="Translation"> The cowherd men, bewildered by Kåñëa's illusory potency, thought their wives had remained home at their sides. Thus they did not harbor any jealous feelings against Him.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Because the gopés loved Kåñëa exclusively, Yogamäyä protected their relationship with the Lord at all times, even though they were married. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté quotes from the Ujjvala-nélamaëi as follows:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mäyä-kalpita-tädåk-stré</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">patibhiù saha saìgamaù</div>
<div class="First"> "The gopés' jealous husbands consorted not with their wives but with doubles manufactured by Mäyä. Thus these men never actually had any intimate contact with the divine ladies of Vraja." The gopés are the internal energy of the Lord and can never belong to any other living being. Kåñëa arranged their apparent marriage to other men simply to create the excitement of parakéya-rasa, the love between a married woman and her paramour. These activities are absolutely pure because they are the Lord's pastimes, and saintly persons since time immemorial have relished these supreme spiritual events.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> After an entire night of Brahmä had passed, Lord Kåñëa advised the gopés to return to their homes. Although they did not wish to do so, the Lord's beloved consorts complied with His command.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In the Bhagavad-gétä (8.17) Lord Kåñëa explains, "By human calculation, a thousand ages taken together is the duration of Brahmä's one day. And such also is the duration of his night." Thus one thousand ages entered within a single twelve-hour night when Lord Kåñëa performed His räsa dance. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté compares this inconceivable impression of time to the fact that many universes fit neatly within the forty-mile range of earthly Våndävana. Or one may consider that mother Yaçodä could not encircle the small abdomen of child Kåñëa with numerous ropes, and that at another time He manifested many universes within His mouth. The transcendence of spiritual reality above and beyond mundane physics is concisely explained in Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé's Laghu-bhagavatämåta:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">evaà prabhoù priyäëäà ca</div>

<div class="First"> "Nothing is impossible for the Lord, His dear devotees, His transcendental abode or the time of His pastimes, for all these entities are inconceivably powerful."</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté further explains that the word väsudevänumoditäù indicates that Lord Kåñëa advised the gopés, "To assure the success of these pastimes, you and I should keep them secret." The word väsudeva, a name of Kåñëa, also indicates Lord Kåñëa's plenary expansion who acts as the presiding Deity of consciousness. When the word väsudeva is understood in this context, the word väsudevänumoditäù indicates that the presiding Deity of consciousness, Väsudeva, manifested embarrassment and fear of their elders within the gopés' hearts, and therefore it was only with great reluctance that the young girls returned home.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The extraordinary power of Lord Kåñëa's conjugal pastimes is clearly revealed here. Qualitatively, the Lord's spiritual, loving pastimes are the diametric opposite of material, lusty affairs, so much so that simply by hearing about the Lord's pastimes a devotee conquers sex desire. By reading pornographic literature or hearing about material romance, we certainly do not conquer sex desire but rather increase our lust. But hearing or reading about the Lord's conjugal affairs has exactly the opposite effect because they are of the opposite nature, being purely spiritual. Therefore it is by the causeless mercy of Lord Kåñëa that He exhibits His räsa-lélä within this world. If we become attached to this narration, we will experience the bliss of spiritual love and thus reject the perverted reflection of that love, which is called lust. As nicely put by Lord Kåñëa in the Bhagavad-gétä (2.59), paraà dåñövä nivartate: "Once having directly experienced the Supreme, one will not return to material pleasures."</div>
<div class="First"> Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Thirty-third Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Räsa Dance."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 34. Nanda Mahäräja Saved and Çaìkhacüòa Slain</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter describes how Lord Çré Kåñëa saved His father Nanda from the clutches of a serpent and delivered a Vidyädhara named Sudarçana from the curse of the Äìgirasa sages.</div>
<div class="First"> One day Nanda Mahäräja and the other cowherd men placed their family members on their bullock carts and went to the Ambikävana forest to worship Lord Çiva. After bathing in the Sarasvaté River and worshiping Lord Sadäçiva, a form of Lord Viñëu, they decided to spend the night in the forest. As they slept, a hungry serpent came and began to swallow Nanda Mahäräja. Terrified, Nanda cried out in distress, "O Kåñëa! O my son, please save this surrendered soul!" The cowherd men immediately awoke and began beating the serpent with wooden torches, but the serpent would not release Nanda. Then Lord Kåñëa came and touched the serpent with His lotus foot. The serpent was immediately freed from his reptilian body and appeared in his original form as a demigod. He told them about his previous identity and described how he had been cursed by a group of sages. Then he offered his homage at the lotus feet of Çré Kåñëa and, on the Lord's order, returned to his own abode. Later, during the Dola-pürëimä festival, Çré Kåñëa and Baladeva enjoyed pastimes in the forest with the young women of Vraja. The girlfriends of Baladeva and those of Kåñëa joined together and sang about Their transcendental qualities. When the two Lords became absorbed in singing to the point of apparent intoxication, a servant of Kuvera's named Çaìkhacüòa boldly came forward and began abducting the gopés. The young girls called out, "Kåñëa, please save us!" and He and Räma began to chase after Çaìkhacüòa. "Don't be afraid!" Kåñëa called out to the gopés. In fear of the Lords, Çaìkhacüòa left the gopés aside and ran for his life. Kåñëa chased after him, swiftly approached him and with a blow of His fist removed Çaìkhacüòa's jewel, together with his head. Then Kåñëa brought the jewel back and presented it to Lord Baladeva.</div>

Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté also quotes authorities who claim that Ambikävana lies on the bank of the Sarasvaté River, northwest of Mathurä.

<div class="Chapnum"> 35. The Gopés Sing of Kåñëa as He Wanders in the Forest</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter contains the songs the gopés sing to express their feelings of separation from Kåñëa when He goes to the forest during the day. As the gopés' mood of separation from Çré Kåñëa becomes ever more intense, His names, forms, qualities and pastimes begin spontaneously manifesting in their hearts. Thus they join together and sing as follows: "The beauty of Kåñëa attracts the minds of all. When He stands in His threefold-bending way and plays upon His flute, the Siddhas' wives, flying in the sky with their husbands, become attracted to Him and forget external reality. The bulls, cows and other animals in the pasture become stunned in ecstasy, and they stand so still, with the grass unchewed between their teeth, that they appear like figures in a drawing. Indeed, even the unconscious rivers stop flowing. "Just see! When Kåñëa dresses Himself in forest array and calls the cows' names by blowing on His flute, even the trees and creepers become so ecstatic out of love that their limbs display eruptions and their sap pours down like a torrent of tears. The sound of Kåñëa's flute causes the cranes, swans and other birds in the lakes to close their eyes in deep meditation, the clouds in the sky to gently rumble, imitating the flute's vibration, and even such great authorities in the science of music as Indra, Siva and Brahmä to become astonished. And just as we gopés are anxious to offer everything we have to Kåñëa, so the wives of the black deer follow Him about, imitating us. "When Kåñëa is returning to Vraja, He constantly plays His flute while His young companions chant His glories, and Brahmä and other chief demigods come to worship His lotus feet."</div>
<div class="First"> Thus the gopés, feeling intense separation from Kåñëa, sing of His pastimes.</div>

At that time the minds of the gopés would run after Him, but the young girls had to stay back in the village and do their own duties. Thus feeling the pain of separation, they would sing about Çré Kåñëa's transcendental pastimes.</div>

<div class="Translation"> O girls! This son of Nanda, who gives joy to the distressed, bears steady lightning on His chest and has a smile like a jeweled necklace. Now please hear something wonderful. When He vibrates His flute, Vraja's bulls, deer and cows, standing in groups at a great distance, are all captivated by the sound, and they stop chewing the food in their mouths and cock their ears.

The gopés, in separation from Kåñëa, marvel at the extraordinary effect of the Lord's flute-playing.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Çrédhara Svämé gives the following explanation of the compound word hära-häsa, which compares Lord Kåñëa's smile to a necklace: "The word can mean 'He whose smile is brilliantly clear like a jeweled necklace' or 'He whose smile is reflected from His jeweled necklaces,' because while Kåñëa plays the flute He bends His head down and smiles. The word can also mean 'He whose smile, like a jeweled necklace, casts its effulgence upon His chest' or 'He whose necklaces shine brilliantly, just like a smile.' "</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear gopé, sometimes Mukunda imitates the appearance of a wrestler by decorating Himself with leaves, peacock feathers and colored minerals. Then, in the company of Balaräma and the cowherd boys, He plays His flute to call the cows. At that time the rivers stop flowing, their water stunned by the ecstasy they feel as they eagerly wait for the wind to bring them the dust of His lotus feet. But like us, the rivers are not very pious, and thus they merely wait with their arms trembling out of love.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The gopés state here that the sound of Kåñëa's flute causes even inanimate objects like rivers to become conscious and then stunned in ecstasy. Just as the gopés could not always be in Kåñëa's physical association, the rivers could not come to the Lord's lotus feet. Although they desired the Lord, their movement was checked by ecstasy, and their "arms," their waves, trembled with love of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Kåñëa moves about the forest in the company of His friends, who vividly chant the glories of His magnificent deeds. He thus appears just like the Supreme Personality of Godhead exhibiting His inexhaustible opulences. When the cows wander onto the mountainsides and Kåñëa calls out to them with the sound of His flute, the trees and creepers in the forest respond by becoming so luxuriant with fruits and flowers that they seem to be manifesting Lord Viñëu within their hearts. As their branches bend low with the weight, the filaments on their trunks and vines stand erect out of the ecstasy of love of God, and both the trees and the creepers pour down a rain of sweet sap. Maddened by the divine, honeylike aroma of the tulasé flowers on the garland Kåñëa wears, swarms of bees sing loudly for Him, and that most beautiful of all persons thankfully acknowledges and acclaims their song by taking His flute to His lips and playing it. The charming flute song then steals away the minds of the cranes, swans and other lake-dwelling birds. Indeed they approach Kåñëa, close their eyes and, maintaining strict silence, worship Him by fixing their consciousness upon Him in deep meditation.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has made several illuminating comments on these verses. He gives the analogy that just as when householder Vaiñëavas hear a saìkértana party approaching they become ecstatic and offer obeisances, so the trees and creepers in Våndävana became ecstatic when they heard Kåñëa's flute and bowed low with their branches and vines. The word darçanéya-tilaka in Text 10 indicates not only that the Lord is "the most excellent (to see)," but also that He decorated Himself with attractive reddish tilaka taken from the mineral rich earth of Våndävana forest. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté also points out that tulasé, although exalted in many ways, is not normally considered an especially fragrant plant. However, early in the morning tulasé emits a transcendental fragrance that ordinary people cannot perceive but that transcendental personalities fully appreciate. The bees who are privileged to swarm about the flower garlands worn by the Supreme Personality of Godhead certainly appreciate this fragrance, and Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté quotes from the Bhägavatam (3.15.19) to the effect that the most fragrant plants in Vaikuëöha also appreciate the special qualifications of Tulasé-devé.</div>
<div class="First"> The word sandhita-veëuù in Text 10 indicates that Lord Kåñëa placed His flute firmly upon His lips. And the melody emanating from that flute is certainly the most enchanting of sounds, as the gopés describe in this chapter.</div>

Thus the best collective intelligence in the universe could not definitively analyze the enchanting musical arrangements of the Supreme Lord.</div>

<div class="First"> Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains that in the afternoon Çré Kåñëa dressed Himself in new clothing and then went out to call the cows home. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté gives the following information about the transcendental cows of Våndävana: "For each of the four colors of cows—white, red, black and yellow—there are twenty-five subdivisions, making a total of one hundred colors. And such qualities as being colored like sandalwood-pulp tilaka [speckled] or having a head shaped like a mådaìga drum create eight further groups. To count these 108 groups of cows, distinguished by color and form, Kåñëa is using a string of 108 jewel-beads....</div>
<div class="First"> "Thus when Kåñëa calls out 'Hey Dhavalé [the name of a white cow],' a whole group of white cows come forward, and when He calls 'Haàsé, Candané, Gaìgä, Muktä 'and so on, the twenty-four other groups of white cows come. The reddish cows are called Aruëé, Kuìkuma, Sarasvaté, etc., the blackish ones Çyämalä, Dhümalä, Yamunä, etc., and the yellowish ones Pétä, Piìgalä, Haritälikä, etc. Those in the group with tilaka marks on their foreheads are called Citritä, Citra-tilakä, Dérgha-tilakä and Tiryak-tilakä, and there are groups known as Mådaìga-mukhé [mådaìga-head], Siàha-mukhé [lion-head] and so on.</div>
<div class="First"> "Thus being called by name, the cows are coming forward, and Kåñëa, thinking that when it is time to bring them back from the forest none should be forgotten, is counting them on His jewel-beads."</div>

His garland is powdered by the dust raised by the cows' hooves, and His beauty, enhanced by His fatigue, creates an ecstatic festival for everyone's eyes. Eager to fulfill His friends' desires, Kåñëa is the moon arisen from the womb of mother Yaçodä.</div>

<div class="First"> This verse definitely confirms that the so-called pain of the heartbroken gopés is actually great spiritual bliss. On the material platform, pain is pain—period. But on the spiritual platform, so-called pain is simply a different variety of spiritual ecstasy. In the Western countries, people take pleasure in mixing different flavors of ice cream to produce wonderful combinations of flavor. Similarly, on the spiritual platform Çré Kåñëa and His devotees expertly mix the flavors of spiritual bliss, and thus every day was a treat for the gopés. Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Thirty-fifth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Gopés Sing of Kåñëa as He Wanders in the Forest."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 36. The Slaying of Ariñöä, the Bull Demon</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter describes how Kåñëa killed Ariñöäsura and how Kaàsa reacted when he learned from Närada that Kåñëa and Balaräma were the sons of Vasudeva.</div>
<div class="First"> The demon Ariñöa wanted to kill Kåñëa and Balaräma, and thus he assumed the form of a huge bull with sharp horns. Everyone in Kåñëa's cowherd village became terrified when Ariñöäsura approached it, but the Lord pacified them, and when the bull demon charged Him He seized him by the horns and threw him about six yards. Though weakened, Ariñöa still wanted to attack Kåñëa. Thus, dripping with sweat, he charged the Lord once again. This time Kåñëa grabbed his horns, threw him to the ground and thrashed him like a pile of wet clothing. The demon vomited blood and gave up his life. Then Kåñëa and Räma, while being honored by the demigods and cowherd boys, returned to the village.</div>
<div class="First"> A short time later Närada Muni, the great sage among the demigods, came to see King Kaàsa. He informed the King that Kåñëa and Balaräma were not Nanda's sons but rather Vasudeva's. It was out of fear of Kaàsa that Vasudeva had put the two boys under Nanda's care. Furthermore, said Närada, Kaàsa would meet his death at Their hands.</div>
<div class="First"> Kaàsa shook with fear and anger when he heard all this, and in great agitation he began thinking of how to destroy Kåñëa and Balaräma. He called for the demons Cäëüra and Muñöika and instructed them to kill the two brothers in a wrestling match. Then he spoke to Akrüra, who was expert at executing his duties. Taking Akrüra by the hand, Kaàsa persuaded him to go to Vraja to bring the two boys to Mathurä. Akrüra agreed to carry out Kaàsa's order and then returned home.</div>

<div class="First"> This verse exemplifies the sublime contrast of spiritual qualities within Çré Kåñëa. In one four-line verse we simultaneously learn that Lord Kåñëa killed a powerful and wicked demon and that His boyish beauty gave festive pleasure to His young girlfriends. Lord Kåñëa is as hard as a thunderbolt or as soft as a rose, depending on our attitude toward Him. The demon Ariñöa wanted to kill Kåñëa and all His friends, so the Lord beat him into a wet rag and killed him. The gopés, however, loved Kåñëa, and thus the Lord boyishly reciprocated their conjugal feelings.</div>

<div class="Translation"> After Ariñöäsura had been killed by Kåñëa, who acts wonderfully, Närada Muni went to speak to King Kaàsa. That powerful sage of godly vision addressed the King as follows.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> The term deva-darçana can be understood in many ways, all of which are consistent with the context and purport of this narration. Deva means "God," and darçanaù means "seeing" or "an audience with a great personality." Thus deva-darçana, a name for Närada Muni, indicates that Närada has attained the perfection of seeing God, that getting Närada's audience is as good as getting God's (since Närada is a pure representative of the Lord), and also that Närada's audience is as good as that of the demigods, who are also known as devas. That there are all these meanings of the term deva-darçanaù reveals something of the richness of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam's language. From the Puräëas, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has quoted twenty verses describing a joking conversation between Rädhä and Kåñëa that took place after Kåñëa had killed the demon Ariñöa. This conversation, so kindly quoted by the äcärya, describes the origin of Rädhä-kuëòa and Çyäma-kuëòa, Rädhä's and Kåñëa's bathing ponds. The verses are as follows:</div>

Alas, even though Ariñöa was a terrible demon, still he was a male cow, so You will have to undergo atonement, just as Lord Indra did after killing Våträsura. But how can You purify Yourself without going to the trouble of visiting every single holy place in the three worlds?' "</div>

<div class="First"> As a final note, it should be mentioned that Närada Muni, being a great sage, understood that the killing of Ariñöa more or less concluded the pastimes of Kåñëa in Våndävana. Therefore Närada, anxious to facilitate the transferal of Kåñëa's pastimes to Mathurä, approached Kaàsa and addressed him as follows.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Kaàsa had been led to believe that Kåñëa was the son of Yaçodä and that Devaké's eighth child had been a daughter. The identity of Devaké's eighth child was extremely important to Kaàsa because a prophecy had foretold that her eighth child would kill him. Here Närada informs the King that the eighth child of Devaké was the formidable Kåñëa, thus implying that the prophecy should be taken very seriously. Having received this information, Kaàsa obviously will now do everything in his power to kill Kåñëa and Balaräma.</div>

According to the äcäryas, Närada also advised Kaàsa that if he killed Vasudeva the two young boys might flee and that it was therefore better not to kill him. Rather, Närada recommended, Kaàsa should bring Kåñëa and Balaräma to Kaàsa's capital city, Mathurä.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté points out that Närada did not act inimically toward the great devotees Vasudeva and Devaké when he revealed this information to Kaàsa. In fact, as explained in the Eleventh Canto, Vasudeva was grateful to Närada because he was arranging for Kaàsa's death at Kåñëa's hands, and further arranging for Kåñëa to come and live in Mathurä, where His loving father could associate with Him.</div>

Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Thirty-sixth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Slaying of Ariñöä, the Bull Demon."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 37. The Killing of the Demons Keçi and Vyoma</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter describes the killing of the horse demon, Keçé; Närada's glorification of Lord Kåñëa's future pastimes; and Kåñëa's killing of Vyomäsura. On Kaàsa's order the Keçi demon assumed the form of a huge horse and went to Vraja. As he approached, his loud neighing terrified all the inhabitants, and they began looking for Çré Kåñëa. When He saw the demon, Kåñëa came forward and challenged him to come near. Keçé charged Kåñëa and tried to strike Him with his front legs, but the Lord seized them, whirled the demon around several times, and then threw him a distance of one hundred bow-lengths. Keçé remained unconscious for some time. When the demon regained consciousness, he furiously charged Kåñëa again, his mouth agape. The Lord then thrust His left arm into the horse demon's mouth, and as Keçé tried to bite the arm, it felt like a red-hot iron rod. Kåñëa's arm expanded more and more, finally choking the demon, and in extreme agony Keçé gave up his life. Lord Kåñëa then removed His arm. He stood calmly, showing no pride at having killed the demon, as the demigods showered down flowers from the sky and glorified the Lord with prayers.</div>
<div class="First"> Soon thereafter Närada Muni, the great sage among the demigods, approached Kåñëa and prayed to Him in various ways, glorifying the Lord's future pastimes. Then Närada paid his obeisances and departed. One day, while tending the cows, Kåñëa, Balaräma and the cowherd boys became engrossed in playing hide-and-go-seek. Some of the boys took the role of sheep, some the role of thieves, and others shepherds. The shepherds would search for the sheep when the thieves stole them. Taking advantage of this game, a demon named Vyoma, sent by Kaàsa, dressed himself like a cowherd boy and joined the band of "thieves." He abducted a few cowherd boys at a time and threw them into a mountain cave, keeping them there by blocking the entrance with a boulder. Gradually Vyomäsura abducted all but four or five cowherd boys. When Kåñëa saw what the demon was doing, He ran after him, grabbed him and killed him just as one would kill a sacrificial animal.</div>

The hairs of his mane scattered the clouds and the demigods' airplanes throughout the sky, and he terrified everyone present with his loud neighing. When the Supreme Personality of Godhead saw how the demon was frightening His village of Gokula by neighing terribly and shaking the clouds with his tail, the Lord came forward to meet him. Keçé was searching for Kåñëa to fight, so when the Lord stood before him and challenged him to approach, the horse responded by roaring like a lion.</div>

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Thirty-seventh Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Killing of the Demons Keçé and Vyoma."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 38. Akrüra's Arrival in Våndävana</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter describes Akrüra's trip from Mathurä to Våndävana, his meditation on Kåñëa and Balaräma along the way and the honor the two Lords showed Akrüra upon his arrival.</div>
<div class="First"> Early in the morning on the day after Kaàsa had ordered him to bring Kåñëa and Balaräma to Mathurä, Akrüra prepared his chariot and set off for Gokula. As he traveled, he thought as follows: "I am about to attain the great good fortune of seeing Çré Kåñëa's lotus feet, which are worshiped by Brahmä, Rudra and the other demigods. Although Kaàsa is an enemy of the Supreme Lord and His devotees, still, it is by Kaàsa's grace that I will get this great boon of seeing the Lord. When I first catch sight of His lotus feet, all my sinful reactions will be destroyed at once. I will descend from my chariot and fall at the feet of Kåñëa and Balaräma, and even though I have been sent by Kaàsa, the omniscient Çré Kåñëa will certainly harbor no animosity toward me." As Akrüra thus thought to himself, he arrived in Gokula at sunset. Alighting from his chariot in the cowherd pasture, he began rolling about in the dust in great ecstasy.</div>
<div class="First"> Then Akrüra continued on to Vraja. When he saw Kåñëa and Balaräma he fell at Their lotus feet, and both the Lords embraced him. Afterward They brought him to Their residence, inquired from him about the comfort of his trip and honored him in various ways-offering him water for washing his feet, arghya, a seat and so forth. They relieved him of his fatigue by massaging his feet and served him a delicious banquet. Mahäräja Nanda also honored Akrüra with many sweet words.</div>

<div class="Translation"> He is the witness of material cause and effect, yet He is always free from false identification with them. By His internal potency He dispels the darkness of separation and confusion. The individual souls in this world, who are manifested here when He glances upon His material creative energy, indirectly perceive Him in the activities of their life airs, senses and intelligence.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> In this verse Akrüra establishes the all-powerful position of the Supreme Lord, whom he is about to see in Våndävana. The false concept of separation from the Lord is described in the Eleventh Canto of the Bhägavatam (11.2.37): bhayaà dvitéyäbhiniveçataù syäd éçäd apetasya viparyayo 'småtiù. Although all existence emanates from the Absolute Truth, Kåñëa, we imagine a "second thing," this material world, to be entirely separate from the Lord's existence. With this mentality, we try to exploit that "second thing" for our sense gratification. Thus the psychological underpinning of material life is the illusion that this world is somehow separate from God and therefore meant for our enjoyment.</div>
<div class="First"> It is ironic that the impersonal philosophers, in their radical renunciation of this world, claim it to be utterly false and totally separate from the Absolute. Unfortunately, this artificial attempt to divest this world of its divine nature, or, in other words, its relation to God, does not lead people to utterly reject it but rather to try to enjoy it. While it is true that this world is temporary and thus in one sense illusory, the mechanism of illusion is a spiritual potency of the Supreme Lord. Realizing this, we should immediately desist from any attempt to exploit this world; rather, we should recognize it as God's energy. We will actually give up our material desires only when we understand that this world belongs to God and is therefore not meant for our selfish gratification.</div>
<div class="First"> The word abhéyate here refers to a process of surmising the presence of the Lord through meditative introspection. This process is also described in the</div>

<div class="First"> "The Personality of Godhead, Lord Çré Kåñëa, is in every living being along with the individual soul. And this fact is perceived and hypothesized in our acts of seeing and taking help from the intelligence." Akrüra states that the Lord is free of the egoistic pride afflicting ordinary, embodied souls. Yet the Lord appears to be embodied like everyone else, and therefore someone might object to the statement that He is free of egoism. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté comments on this puzzle as follows: "How can we distinguish between being free of false ego and being afflicted by it? 'If a living entity is situated in a body,' [argues the objector,] 'he will encounter the unhappiness and confusion that occur within it, just as a person living in a house, whether he be attached to it or not, cannot avoid experiencing the darkness, warmth and cold that occur within it.' This objection is answered as follows: By His internal potency the Lord dispels the darkness of ignorance along with the separateness and bewilderment it produces."</div>

Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Thirty eighth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Akrüra's Arrival in Våndävana."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 39. Akrüra's Vision</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter describes how Akrüra informed Lord Kåñëa and Lord Balaräma of Kaàsa's plans and his activities in Mathurä; what the gopés cried out in distress when Kåñëa left for Mathurä; and also the vision of Lord Viñëu's abode that Akrüra saw within the water of the Yamunä. When Kåñëa and Balaräma offered Akrüra great respect and comfortably seated him on a couch, he felt that all the desires he had reflected on while traveling to Våndävana were now fulfilled. After the evening meal, Kåñëa asked Akrüra whether his trip had been peaceful and whether he was well. The Lord also inquired about how Kaàsa was behaving toward their family members, and finally He asked why Akrüra had come.</div>
<div class="First"> Akrüra described how Kaàsa had been persecuting the Yädavas, what Närada had told Kaàsa and how Kaàsa had been treating Vasudeva cruelly. Akrüra also spoke of Kaàsa's desire to bring Kåñëa and Balaräma to Mathurä to kill Them on the pretext of Their seeing the bow sacrifice and engaging in a wrestling match. Kåñëa and Balaräma laughed out loud when They heard this. They went to Their father, Nanda, and informed him of Kaàsa's orders. Nanda then issued an order to all the residents of Vraja that they should collect various offerings for the King and prepare to go to Mathurä. The young gopés were extremely upset to hear that Kåñëa and Balaräma would be going to Mathurä. They lost all external awareness and began to remember Kåñëa's pastimes. Condemning the creator for separating them from Him, they began to lament. They said that Akrüra did not deserve his name (a, "not"; krüra, "cruel"), since he was so cruel to be taking away their dearmost Kåñëa. "It must be that fate is against us," they lamented, "because otherwise the elders of Vraja would have forbidden Kåñëa to leave. So let us forget our shyness and try to stop Lord Mädhava from going." With these words the young cowherd girls began to chant Kåñëa's names and cry. But even as they wept, Akrüra began taking Kåñëa and Balaräma to Mathurä in his chariot. The cowherd men of Gokula followed behind on their wagons, and the young gopés also walked behind for some distance, but then they became placated by Kåñëa's glances and gestures and pacified by a message from Him that said "I will return." With their minds completely absorbed in Kåñëa, the cowherd girls stood as still as figures in a painting until they could no longer see the chariot's flag or the dust cloud being raised on the road. Then, chanting Kåñëa's glories all the while, they despondently returned to their homes.</div>
<div class="First"> Akrüra halted the chariot at the bank of the Yamunä so Kåñëa and Balaräma could perform a ritual of purification and drink some water. After the two Lords had gotten back into the chariot, Akrüra took Their permission to bathe in the Yamunä. As he recited Vedic mantras, he was startled to see the two Lords standing in the water. Akrüra came out of the river and returned to the chariot-where he saw the Lords still sitting. Then he returned to the water to find out if the two figures he had seen there were real or not. What Akrüra saw in the water was four-armed Lord Väsudeva. His complexion was dark blue like a fresh raincloud, He wore yellow garments and He lay on the lap of thousand-hooded Ananta Çeña. Lord Väsudeva was receiving the prayers of perfected beings, celestial serpents and demons, and He was encircled by His personal attendants. Serving Him were His many potencies, such as Çré, Puñöi and Ilä, while Brahmä and other demigods sang His praises. Akrüra rejoiced at this vision and, joining his palms in supplication, began to pray to the Supreme Lord in a voice choked with emotion.</div>

These are the Lord's six opulences. Ilä is His bhü-çakti, also known as sandhiné, the internal potency of whom the element earth is an expansion. Ürjä is His internal potency for performing pastimes; she expands as the tulasé plant in this world. Vidyä and Avidyä [knowledge and ignorance] are external potencies who cause the living entities' liberation and bondage, respectively. Çakti is His internal pleasure potency, hlädiné, and Mäyä is an internal potency who is the basis of Vidyä and Avidyä. The word ca implies the presence of the Lord's marginal energy, the jéva-çakti, who is subordinate to Mäyä. Lord Viñëu was being served by all these personified potencies."</div>

<div class="Translation"> As the great devotee Akrüra beheld all this, he became extremely pleased and felt enthused with transcendental devotion. His intense ecstasy caused His bodily hairs to stand on end and tears to flow from his eyes, drenching his entire body. Somehow managing to steady himself, Akrüra bowed his head to the ground. Then he joined his palms in supplication and, in a voice choked with emotion, very slowly and attentively began to pray. Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Thirty-ninth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Akrüra's Vision."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 40. The Prayers of Akrüra</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter relates Akrüra's prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="First"> Akrüra prayed, "Brahmä, who created this visible world, emanated from the lotus navel of the Supreme Lord. The five elements of physical nature, the five corresponding objects of perception, the ten senses, the ego, the total nature, the primeval creator and the demigods all originate from His bodily limbs. He cannot be known by sensory knowledge, and thus even Brahmä and the other demigods are ignorant of His real identity.</div>
<div class="First"> "Different classes of people worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead in different ways. Fruitive workers worship Him by performing Vedic sacrifices, philosophers by renouncing material work and pursuing spiritual knowledge, yogés by meditating, Çaivites by worshiping Lord Çiva, Vaiñëavas by following the injunctions of such scriptures as the Païcarätra, and other saintly persons by worshiping Him as the original form of the self, of the material substance and of the controlling demigods. Just as rivers flow from various directions into the ocean, the worship of those who dedicate themselves to these various entities finds its ultimate purpose within the Supreme Lord Viñëu. "The form of the total universe, the Viräö-rüpa, is imagined to be the form of Lord Viñëu. Like aquatics moving about in water or like tiny insects burrowing in an udumbara fruit, all living beings move about within the Lord. These living beings, bewildered by His Mäyä, wander along the path of material work, falsely identifying with body, home and so forth. Under the sway of illusion, a foolish person may overlook a reservoir of water covered by grass and leaves and instead run after a mirage. Similarly, living beings caught in the grip of ignorance abandon Lord Viñëu and become attached to their bodies, homes and so on. Such faithful servants of their senses cannot take shelter of the Supreme Lord's lotus feet. Only if, by His mercy, they get the association of saintly devotees will their material entanglement end. Only then can they develop Kåñëa consciousness by serving the Lord's pure devotees."</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Akrüra has now described how those who follow the paths of Säìkhya, yoga and the three Vedas worship the Supreme Lord in different ways. In the various places where the Vedas appear to recommend that one worship Indra, Varuëa and other demigods, these demigods are stated to be supreme. But at the same time the Vedas state that there is one supreme controller, the Absolute Truth. That is Çré Kåñëa, the Personality of Godhead, who expands His potency through material creation into the forms of the demigods. Thus worship of the demigods goes to Him through the indirect method of karma-käëòa, or fruitive religious rituals. Ultimately, however, one who wants to achieve eternal perfection should worship the Lord directly, in full Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="First"> "Those who are devotees of other gods and who worship them with faith actually worship only Me, O son of Kunté, but they do so in a wrong way. I am the only enjoyer and master of all sacrifices. Therefore, those who do not recognize My true transcendental nature fall down. Those who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods; those who worship the ancestors go to the ancestors; those who worship ghosts and spirits will take birth among such beings; and those who worship Me will live with Me."</div>

<div class="First"> After showing His Viñëu form to Akrüra in the waters of the Yamunä and receiving Akrüra's prayers, Lord Kåñëa withdrew that vision just as an actor winds up his performance. Akrüra emerged from the water and in great amazement approached the Lord, who asked him whether he had seen something wonderful while bathing. Akrüra replied, "Whatever wonderful things there are in the realms of water, earth or sky, all have their existence within You. Thus when one has seen You, nothing remains unseen." Akrüra then began driving the chariot again.</div>
<div class="First"> Kåñëa, Balaräma and Akrüra reached Mathurä late in the afternoon. After meeting up with Nanda Mahäräja and the other cowherds, who had gone on ahead, Kåñëa asked Akrüra to return home, promising to visit him there after He had killed Kaàsa. Akrüra unhappily bid the Lord goodbye, went to King Kaàsa to inform him that Kåñëa and Balaräma had come, and went home. Kåñëa and Balaräma took the cowherd boys with Them to see the splendorous city. As they all entered Mathurä, the women of the city eagerly came out of their houses to see Kåñëa. They had often heard about Him and had long since developed a deep attraction for Him. But now that they were actually seeing Him, they were overwhelmed with happiness, and all their distress due to His absence was eradicated.</div>
<div class="First"> Kåñëa and Balaräma then came upon Kaàsa's wicked washerman. Kåñëa asked him for some of the first-class garments he was carrying, but he refused and even chastised the two Lords. At this Kåñëa became very angry and beheaded the man with His fingertips. The washerman's assistants, seeing his untimely end, dropped their bundles of clothes on the spot and ran off in all directions. Kåñëa and Balaräma then took some of the garments They especially fancied.</div>
<div class="First"> Next a weaver approached the two Lords and arrayed Them suitably, for which service he received from Kåñëa opulence in this life and liberation in the next. Kåñëa and Balaräma then went to the house of the garland-maker Sudämä. Sudämä offered Them his full obeisances, worshiped Them by bathing Their feet and offering Them such items as arghya and sandalwood paste, and chanted prayers in Their honor. Then he adorned Them with garlands of fragrant flowers. Pleased, the Lords offered him whatever benedictions he wished, and then They moved on.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The Lord saw Mathurä, with its tall gates and household entrances made of crystal, its immense archways and main doors of gold, its granaries and other storehouses of copper and brass, and its impregnable moats. Beautifying the city were pleasant gardens and parks. The main intersections were fashioned of gold, and there were mansions with private pleasure gardens, along with guildhalls and many other buildings. Mathurä resounded with the calls of peacocks and pet turtledoves, who sat in the small openings of the lattice windows and on the gem-studded floors, and also on the columned balconies and on the ornate rafters in front of the houses. These balconies and rafters were adorned with vaidürya stones, diamonds, crystal quartz, sapphires, coral, pearls and emeralds. All the royal avenues and commercial streets were sprinkled with water, as were the side roads and courtyards, and flower garlands, newly grown sprouts, parched grains and rice had been scattered about everywhere. Gracing the houses' doorways were elaborately decorated pots filled with water, which were bedecked with mango leaves, smeared with yogurt and sandalwood paste, and encircled by flower petals and ribbons. Near the pots were flags, rows of lamps, bunches of flowers and the trunks of banana and betel-nut trees.</div>

<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura gives this description of the elaborately decorated pots: "On either side of each doorway, above the scattered rice, is a pot. Encircling each pot are flower petals, on its neck are ribbons and in its mouth are leaves of mango and other trees. Above each pot, on a gold plate, are rows of lamps. A trunk of a banana tree stands on either side of each pot, and a betel-nut tree trunk stands in front and also behind. Flags lean against the pots."</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> We can see a clear difference between Lord Kåñëa's dealings with the nasty washerman and His dealings with the devoted florist Sudämä. The Lord is as hard as a thunderbolt for those who defy Him and as soft as a rose for those who surrender to Him. Therefore we should all sincerely surrender to Lord Kåñëa, since that is clearly in our self-interest.</div>
<div class="First"> Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Forty-first Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Kåñëa and Balaräma Enter Mathurä."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 42. The Breaking of the Sacrificial Bow</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter describes the benediction Trivakrä received, the breaking of the sacrificial bow, the destruction of Kaàsa's soldiers, the inauspicious omens Kaàsa saw and the festivities at the wrestling arena. After leaving Sudämä's house, Lord Kåñëa came upon Trivakrä, a young hunchbacked maidservant of Kaàsa's who was carrying a tray of fine ointments. The Lord asked her who she was and requested some ointment from her. Entranced by His beauty and joking words, Trivakrä gave both Kåñëa and Balaräma a good deal of ointment. In return, Kåñëa stepped on her toes with His lotus feet, took hold of her chin and lifted, thus straightening her spine. The now beautiful and charming Trivakrä then grabbed the edge of Kåñëa's upper cloth and asked Him to come to her house. Kåñëa replied that after He had taken care of some business He would certainly come and relieve her mental torment. Then the two Lords continued Their sightseeing tour of Mathurä.</div>
<div class="First"> As Kåñëa and Balaräma walked along the King's road, the merchants worshiped Them with various offerings. Kåñëa asked where the bow sacrifice was to take place, and when He arrived at the arena He saw the wonderful bow, which resembled Lord Indra's. Despite the guards' protests, Kåñëa forcibly picked up the bow, easily strung it and in an instant broke it in half, producing an ear-splitting sound that filled the heavens and struck terror in the heart of Kaàsa. The many guards attacked Kåñëa, crying out "Seize Him! Kill Him!" But Kåñëa and Balaräma simply picked up the two halves of the bow and beat the guards to death. Next the Lords annihilated a company of soldiers sent by Kaàsa, and then They left the arena and continued Their tour. When the people of the city saw the amazing prowess and beauty of Kåñëa and Balaräma, they thought They must be two chief demigods. Indeed, as the residents of Mathurä gazed upon the Lords, they enjoyed all the blessings the gopés had predicted.</div>
<div class="First"> At sunset Kåñëa and Balaräma returned to the cowherds' camp for Their evening meal. They then passed the night resting comfortably. But King Kaàsa was not so fortunate. When he heard how Kåñëa and Balaräma had easily broken the mighty bow and destroyed his soldiers, he spent the night in great anxiety. Both while awake and while dreaming he saw many ill omens portending his imminent death, and his fear ruined any chance for rest. At dawn the wrestling festival began. Crowds of people from the city and outlying districts entered the arena and took their seats in the lavishly decorated galleries. Kaàsa, his heart trembling, sat down on the royal dais and invited Nanda Mahäräja and the other cowherd men to come sit in their places, and they did so after offering him their gifts. The musical overture then began as the sounds of the wrestlers slapping their arms resounded.</div>

The bestower of the ecstasy of love smiled and inquired from her as follows.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the young hunchbacked girl was actually a partial expansion of the Lord's wife Satyabhämä. Satyabhämä is the Lord's internal energy known as Bhü-çakti, and this expansion of hers, known as Påthivé, represents the earth, which was bent down by the great burden of countless wicked rulers. Lord Kåñëa descended to remove these wicked rulers, and thus His pastime of straightening out the hunchback Trivakrä, as explained in these verses, represents His rectifying the burdened condition of the earth. At the same time, the Lord awarded Trivakrä a conjugal relationship with Himself. In addition to the given meaning, the word rasa-pradaù indicates that the Lord amused His cowherd boyfriends by His dealings with the young hunchback.</div>

<div class="First"> Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté explains that Trivakrä, who is also known as Kubjä, used the singular address sundara, "O handsome one," to hint that she felt conjugal desire for Kåñëa alone, and she used the dual form yuväm, "for both of You," to try to hide her conjugal sentiment. The hunchback's name, Trivakrä, indicates that her body was bent at the neck, chest and waist.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté, the word samähutäù indicates that King Kaàsa respectfully called the leaders of Vraja forward so that they could make their offerings to the central government. According to the äcärya, Kaàsa assured Nanda as follows: "My dear King of Vraja, you are the most important of my village rulers. Yet even though you have come to Mathurä from your cowherd village, you have not come to visit me. Is that because you are frightened? Don't think that your two sons are bad because They broke the bow. I invited Them here because I heard They were extremely powerful, and I've arranged this wrestling match as a test of Their strength. So please come forward without hesitation. Don't be afraid." Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté further states that Nanda Mahäräja noticed his two sons were not present. Apparently, out of disrespect for King Kaàsa's order, They had taken the morning off and gone elsewhere. Thus Kaàsa delegated some cowherd men to go look for Them and advise Them to behave properly and come back to the wrestling arena. The äcärya also states that the reason Nanda and the other cowherd men sat in the galleries was that they could not find any sitting places on the royal dais. Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Forty-second Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Breaking of the Sacrificial Bow."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 43. Kåñëa Kills the Elephant Kuvalayäpéòa</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter tells how Lord Kåñëa killed the lordly elephant Kuvalayäpéòa, how Kåñëa and Balaräma entered the wrestling arena and what Kåñëa said to the wrestler Cäëüra.</div>
<div class="First"> After finishing Their early-morning rituals, Kåñëa and Balaräma heard kettledrums heralding the start of the wrestling match, and They went to see the festivities. At the gate of the wrestling arena They encountered an elephant named Kuvalayäpéòa, who attacked Kåñëa at the urging of his keeper. The mighty elephant grabbed at Kåñëa with his trunk, but the Lord struck back and then disappeared from the beast's sight among his legs. Enraged at not being able to see Kåñëa, Kuvalayäpéòa sought Him out with his sense of smell and seized Him. But the Lord pulled loose. In this way Kåñëa teased and tormented Kuvalayäpéòa, finally yanking out one of his tusks and beating him and his keepers to death.</div>
<div class="First"> Sprinkled with the elephant's blood and carrying one of his tusks on His shoulder as a weapon, Lord Kåñëa appeared unprecedentedly beautiful as He entered the wrestling arena. There the various classes of people saw Him in different ways, according to their specific relationship with Him. When King Kaàsa heard how Kåñëa and Balaräma had killed Kuvalayäpéòa, he realized They were invincible and became filled with anxiety. The members of the audience, on the other hand, became joyful as they reminded one another about the Lords' amazing pastimes. The people declared that Kåñëa and Balaräma must be two expansions of the Supreme Lord Näräyaëa who had descended into the house of Vasudeva. Cäëüra then stepped forward and challenged Kåñëa and Balaräma to wrestle, saying King Kaàsa wished to see such a match. Kåñëa replied, "Although We are merely nomadic forest folk, We are nonetheless subjects of the King; thus We will not hesitate to please him with an exhibition of wrestling." As soon as Cäëüra heard this, he suggested that Kåñëa should wrestle him and that Balaräma should wrestle Muñöika.</div>

The Lords reasoned: 'Even after We have made Our power known by breaking the bow and by performing other feats, Our parents have still not secured freedom. Kaàsa is again trying to kill them. Therefore, although he is Our maternal uncle, it will not be wrong for Us to kill him.' They assured Their offenselessness by this reasoning."</div>

<div class="Translation"> The various groups of people in the arena regarded Kåñëa in different ways when He entered it with His elder brother.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Çrédhara Svämé quotes the following verse, which explains the ten attitudes toward Kåñëa described here:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">raudro 'dbhutaç ca çåìgäro</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">häsyaà véro dayä tathä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhayänakaç ca bébhatsaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">çäntaù sa-prema-bhaktikaù</div>
<div class="First"> "[There are ten different moods:] fury [perceived by the wrestlers], wonder [by the men], conjugal attraction [the women], laughter [the cowherds], chivalry [the kings], mercy [His parents], terror [Kaàsa], ghastliness [the unintelligent], peaceful neutrality [the yogés] and loving devotion [the Våñëis]." Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté points out that people like the wrestlers, Kaàsa and the impious rulers perceive Kåñëa as dangerous, angry or threatening because they fail to understand the actual position of the Personality of Godhead. Actually, Lord Kåñëa is everyone's friend and well-wisher, but because we rebel against Him, He chastises us, and thus we may perceive Him as threatening. Kåñëa, or God, is actually merciful, and when He punishes us, that is also His mercy.</div>
<div class="First"> Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura quotes the following Vedic statement: raso vai saù rasaà hy eväyaà labdhvänandé bhavati. "He Himself is rasa, the taste or mellow of a particular relationship. And certainly one who achieves this rasa becomes änandé, filled with bliss." (Taittiréya Upaniñad 2.7.1) Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté quotes a further verse to explain the word rasa:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">vyatétya bhävanä-vartma</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yaç camatkära-bhära-bhüù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">hådi sattvojjvale bäòhaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">svadate sa raso mataù</div>
<div class="First"> "That which is beyond imagination, heavy with wonder and relished in the heart shining with goodness—such is known as rasa."</div>
<div class="First"> As Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé elaborately explains in his Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu, there are five main rasas—neutrality, servitude, friendship, parental love and conjugal love—and seven secondary rasas—amazement, humor, chivalry, compassion, fury, fear and dread. Thus altogether there are twelve rasas, and the supreme object of them all is Çré Kåñëa Himself. In other words, our love and affection are actually meant for Çré Kåñëa. Unfortunately, out of ignorance we stubbornly try to squeeze happiness and love out of material relationships, which are not directly connected to Kåñëa, and thus life becomes a constant frustration. The solution is simple: surrender to Kåñëa, love Kåñëa, love Kåñëa's devotees and be happy forever.</div>

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Forty-third Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Kåñëa Kills the Elephant Kuvalayäpéòa."</div>
<div class="Chapnum"> 44. The Killing of Kaàsa</div>
<div class="First"> This chapter tells how Kåñëa and Balaräma killed the wrestlers, how Kåñëa killed Kaàsa and consoled Kaàsa's wives, and how the two Lords were reunited with Their mother and father.</div>
<div class="First"> Deciding to wrestle, Lord Kåñëa faced off against Cäëüra, and Lord Baladeva took on Muñöika. Battling arm to arm, head to head, knee to knee and chest to chest, the opponents attacked each other so fiercely that they appeared to be harming even their own bodies. The ladies in the arena, seeing the violent battle, began to condemn the King and all the members of the assembly: "A respectable audience should never have allowed a wrestling match between such huge wrestlers, whose limbs are as tough as lightning bolts, and such tender young boys, who are just entering youth. An intelligent person should never enter an assembly if he sees injustice being done there." Because Vasudeva and Devaké did not fully understand the power of Kåñëa and Balaräma, they became extremely unhappy when they heard the women of the audience speak these words.</div>
<div class="First"> Çré Kåñëa then grabbed Cäëüra's arms, whirled him around several times and threw him to the ground, killing him. Muñöika met a similar fate: after being struck powerfully by Lord Baladeva's palm, he began vomiting blood and then fell down dead. Thereupon the wrestlers named Küöa, Çala and Toçala came forward, but Kåñëa and Balaräma easily killed them with the blows of Their fists and feet. The remaining wrestlers, fearing for their lives, all fled. Except for Kaàsa, everyone present cheered Kåñëa and Balaräma. The King, in a rage, stopped the festive music and ordered that Vasudeva, Nanda, Ugrasena and all the cowherds be severely punished and that Kåñëa and Balaräma be driven from the assembly. Kåñëa became furious when He heard Kaàsa speak this way, and He instantly leapt onto the lofty royal dais. He grabbed Kaàsa by the hair, hurled him down onto the floor of the wrestling ring and threw Himself on top of him. In this way, Kaàsa met his death. Because out of fear Kaàsa had always thought of Kåñëa, after his death he gained the liberation of having a form like the Lord's. Kaàsa's eight brothers then attacked Kåñëa, but Balaräma easily killed each of them with His club, just as a lion kills defenseless animals. Kettledrums resounded in the sky as the joyful demigods rained down flowers and chanted the glories of Lord Kåñëa and Lord Balaräma.</div>
<div class="First"> The wives of Kaàsa, grieving for their husband, lamented that he had died because of his violence toward other living beings and his lack of respect for Kåñëa, the Supreme Soul, who creates, maintains and destroys the entire universe. The Lord consoled the widows, had the funeral rites performed for Kaàsa and his brothers and then released His mother and father from bondage. Kåñëa offered obeisances at His parents' feet, but they, now understanding Him to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead, did not embrace Him.</div>
