<div class="Chapnum">14. Brahmä's Prayers to Lord Kåñëa</div>
<div class="First">This chapter describes the prayers Brahmä offered to Lord Kåñëa, who is also known as Nanda-nandana.</div>
<div class="First">For His satisfaction, Brahmä first praised the beauty of the Lord'stranscendental limbs and then declared that His original identity of sweetnessis even more difficult to comprehend than His opulence. Only by thedevotional process of hearing and chanting transcendental sounds receivedfrom Vedic authorities can one realize the Personality of Godhead. It isfruitless to try to realize God through processes outside the scope of Vedic authority.</div>
<div class="First">The mystery of the Personality of Godhead, who is the reservoir ofunlimited spiritual qualities, is inconceivable; it is even more difficult tounderstand than the impersonal Supreme. Thus only by the mercy of God canone understand His glories. Finally realizing this, Brahmä repeatedlycondemned his own actions and recognized that Lord Çré Kåñëa, the ultimateshelter of the universe, is Brahmä's own father, the original Näräyaëa. In this way Brahmä begged the Lord's forgiveness.</div>
<div class="First">Brahmä then glorified the inconceivable opulence of the Personality ofGodhead and described the ways in which Brahmä and Çiva differ from LordViñëu, the reason for the Supreme Lord's appearance in various species ofdemigods, animals and so on, the eternal nature of the pastimes of thePersonality of Godhead, and the temporality of the material world. Byknowing the Supreme Personality in truth, the individual spirit soul canachieve liberation from bondage. In actuality, however, both liberation andbondage are unreal, for it is only from the living entity's conditioned outlookthat his bondage and liberation are produced. Thinking the personal form ofLord Kåñëa illusory, fools reject His lotus feet and look elsewhere to find theSupreme Self. But the futility of their search is the obvious proof of theirfoolishness. There is simply no way to understand the truth of the Personality of Godhead without His mercy.</div>
<div class="First">Having established this conclusion, Lord Brahmä analyzed the great goodfortune of the residents of Vraja and then personally prayed to be born thereeven as a blade of grass, a bush or a creeper. Indeed, the homes of the residentsof Våndävana are not prisons of material existence but rather abodes enviedeven by the jïänés and yogés. On the other hand, any home without aconnection to Lord Kåñëa is in fact a prison cell of material existence. Finally,Brahmä offered his whole self at the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord and,praising Him again and again, circumambulated Him and took his leave.Lord Kåñëa then gathered the animals Brahmä stole and led them to theplace on the Yamunä's bank where the cowherd boys had been taking lunch.The same friends who had been present before were sitting there now. By thepower of Kåñëa's illusory energy, they were not at all aware of what hadhappened. Thus when Kåñëa arrived with the calves, the boys told Him,"You've returned so quickly! Very good. As long as You were gone we couldn't take even a morsel of food, so come and eat."</div>
<div class="First">Laughing at the words of the cowherd boys, Lord Kåñëa began taking Hismeal in their company. While eating, Kåñëa pointed out to His young friendsthe skin of the python, and the boys thought, "Kåñëa has just now killed thisterrible snake." Indeed, later they related to the residents of Våndävana theincident of Kåñëa's killing the Agha demon. In this way, the cowherd boysdescribed pastimes that Lord Kåñëa had performed in His bälya age (one tofive), even though His paugaëòa age (six to ten) had begun.Çukadeva Gosvämé concludes this chapter by explaining how the gopésloved Lord Kåñëa even more than they loved their own sons.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Lord Brahmä said: My dear Lord, You are the only worshipable Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore I offer my humble obeisances and prayers just to please You. O son of the king of the cowherds, Your transcendental body is dark blue like a new cloud, Your garment is brilliant like lightning, and the beauty of Your face is enhanced by Your guïjä earrings and the peacock feather on Your head. Wearing garlands of various forest flowers and leaves, and equipped with a herding stick, a buffalo horn and a flute, You stand beautifully with a morsel of food in Your hand.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the previous chapter Brahmä, the creator of the universe, tried tobewilder the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa, by stealing Hiscowherd boyfriends and calves. But by a slight exhibition of Kåñëa's ownmystic potency, Brahmä himself was completely bewildered, and now withgreat humility and devotion he offers his humble obeisances and prayers unto the Lord.</div>
<div class="First">The word kavala in this verse refers to a morsel of rice mixed with yogurtthat Kåñëa held in His left hand. According to Sanätana Gosvämé, the Lordheld a cowherding stick and a buffalo horn pressed under His left arm, and Hisflute was placed under His belt. Beautiful young Kåñëa, decorated withmulticolored forest minerals, exhibited opulences far greater than those ofVaikuëöha. Although Brahmä had seen innumerable four-armed forms of theLord, he now surrendered unto the lotus feet of the two-armed form of Kåñëa,who appeared as the son of Nanda Mahäräja. Brahmä offered his prayers to that form.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> My dear Lord, neither I nor anyone else can estimate the potency of this transcendental body of Yours, which has shown such mercy to me and which appears just to fulfill the desires of Your pure devotees. Although my mind is completely withdrawn from material affairs, I cannot understand Your personal form. How, then, could I possibly understand the happiness You experience within Yourself?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Chapter Fourteen, ÇrélaPrabhupäda explains that in the present verse Lord Brahmä expressed thefollowing prayerful sentiment: "Your appearance as a cowherd child is for thebenefit of the devotees, and although I have committed an offense at Yourlotus feet by stealing away Your boys and calves, I can understand that Youhave bestowed Your mercy upon me. That is Your transcendental quality: Youare very affectionate toward Your devotees. But in spite of Your great affectionfor me, I cannot estimate the potency of Your bodily activities. It is to beunderstood that when I, Lord Brahmä, the supreme personality of thisuniverse, cannot estimate the childlike body of the Supreme Personality ofGodhead, then what to speak of others? And if I cannot estimate the spiritualpotency of Your childlike body, then what can I understand about Yourtranscendental pastimes? Therefore, as it is said in the Bhagavad-gétä, anyonewho can understand a little of the transcendental pastimes, appearance anddisappearance of the Lord immediately becomes eligible to enter the kingdomof God after quitting the material body. This statement is confirmed in theVedas, where it is stated. Simply by understanding the Supreme Personality ofGodhead, one can overcome the chain of repeated birth and death. I thereforerecommend that people should not try to understand You by their speculative knowledge."</div>
<div class="First">When Brahmä disrespected the supreme status of the Personality ofGodhead, Lord Kåñëa first bewildered him by exhibiting the Lord's owntranscendental power. Then, having humbled His devotee Brahmä, Kåñëa gave him His personal audience.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, Lord Kåñëa'stranscendental body can also function through the agency of His plenaryexpansions, called viñëu-tattva. As stated by Brahmä himself in theBrahma-saàhitä (5.32): aìgäni yasya sakalendriya-våttimanti. This verseindicates not only that the Lord can perform any bodily function with any ofHis limbs but also that He can see through the eyes of His Viñëu expansions or,indeed, through the eyes of any living entity, and similarly that He can hearthrough the ears of any Viñëu or jéva expansion. Çréla Viçvanätha CakravartéÖhäkura points out that although the Lord can perform any function with anyone of His senses, in His transcendental pastimes as Çré Kåñëa He generallysees with His eyes, touches with His hands, hears with His ears and so on. ThusHe behaves like the most beautiful and charming young cowherd boy.The Vedic knowledge expands from Lord Brahmä, who is described in thefirst verse of Çrémad-Bhägavatam as ädi-kavi, the primeval Vedic scholar. YetBrahmä could not understand the transcendental body of Lord Kåñëa, becauseit is beyond the reach of ordinary Vedic knowledge. Among all thetranscendental forms of the Lord, the two-armed form of Govinda-Kåñëa—isoriginal and supreme. Thus Lord Govinda's pastimes of stealing butter,drinking the gopés' breast-milk, tending the calves, playing His flute andplaying childhood sports are extraordinary even in comparison with the activities of the Lord's Viñëu expansions.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> Those who, even while remaining situated in their established social positions, throw away the process of speculative knowledge and with their body, words and mind offer all respects to descriptions of Your personality and activities, dedicating their lives to these narrations, which are vibrated by You personally and by Your pure devotees, certainly conquer Your Lordship, although You are otherwise unconquerable by anyone within the three worlds.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Here the word udapäsya clearly indicates that one should not even slightlyendeavor to understand the Absolute Truth by the process of mentalspeculation, for it invariably carries one to an imperfect, impersonalunderstanding of God. The word jévanti indicates that a devotee who alwayshears about Lord Kåñëa will go back home, back to Godhead, even if he can donothing except maintain his existence and hear topics concerning the Lord.Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé has explained the words tanu-väì-manobhiù ("bythe body, words and mind") in three ways. In reference to devotees, throughtheir body, words and mind they are able to conquer Lord Kåñëa. Thusbecoming perfect in Kåñëa consciousness, they can touch His lotus feet withtheir hands, call Him to come with their words, and attain His direct audience within their mind simply by thinking about Him.</div>
<div class="First">In the case of nondevotees, the words tanu-väì-manobhiù refer to the wordajita, "unconquered," and indicate that those not engaged in the loving serviceof Lord Kåñëa cannot conquer the Absolute Truth by their bodily strength,verbal expertise or mental power. Despite all their endeavors, the ultimate truth remains beyond their reach.</div>
<div class="First">In reference to the word jitaù, "conquered," the words tanu-väì-manobhiùindicate that the pure devotees of Lord Kåñëa conquer His body, words andmind. Lord Kåñëa's body is conquered because He always remains by the side ofHis pure devotees; Lord Kåñëa's words are conquered because He always chantsthe glories of His devotees; and Lord Kåñëa's mind is conquered because He always thinks about His loving devotees.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has explained the wordstanu-väì-manobhiù in regard to the word namantaù, "offering obeisances." Heexplains that the devotees can take full advantage of the transcendental topicsof the Lord by offering all respects to those topics with their body, words andmind. One should engage his body by touching the ground with his hands andhead while offering obeisances to the topics of the Lord; one should engage hiswords by praising transcendental literatures such as Bhagavad-gétä andÇrémad-Bhägavatam, as well as the devotees who are preaching such literatures;and one should engage his mind by feeling great reverence and pleasure whilehearing the transcendental topics of the Lord. In this way, a sincere devoteewho has acquired even a small amount of transcendental knowledge aboutLord Kåñëa can conquer Him and thus go back home, back to Godhead, for eternal life at the Lord's side.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> My dear Lord, devotional service unto You is the best path for self-realization. If someone gives up that path and engages in the cultivation of speculative knowledge, he will simply undergo a troublesome process and will not achieve his desired result. As a person who beats an empty husk of wheat cannot get grain, one who simply speculates cannot achieve self-realization. His only gain is trouble.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Loving service to the Supreme Person is the natural and eternal function ofevery living entity. If a person renounces his own constitutional function andinstead laboriously seeks so-called enlightenment through impersonal,speculative knowledge, his result is simply the trouble and bother that comefrom following an artificial process. A fool may beat an empty husk, notknowing that the grain has already been removed. Similarly foolish is theperson who throws his mind again and again into the pursuit of knowledgewithout surrendering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for it is theSupreme Personality of Godhead who is the very substance and goal ofknowledge, just as grain is the substance and goal of the entire agriculturaleffort. Vedic knowledge or, indeed, material science without the Personality ofGodhead is exactly like an empty and useless husk of wheat.One may argue that by practicing yoga or cultivating impersonal knowledgeone can acquire prestige, wealth, mystic powers or even impersonal liberation.But these so-called gains are actually useless, because they do not situate theliving being in his constitutional position of loving service to the SupremeLord. Therefore such results, being superfluous to the living being's essentialnature, are impermanent. As stated in the Nåsiàha Puräëa, patreñu puñpeñuphaleñu toyeñv akréta-labhyeñu vadaiva satsu/ bhaktyä su-labhye puruñe puräëemuktyai kim arthaà kriyate prayatnaù: "Since the primeval Personality ofGodhead is easily attained by offering Him such things as leaves, flowers, fruitsand water, which are all found without difficulty, why does one need to endeavor for liberation separately?"</div>
<div class="First">Although the process of devotional service to Lord Kåñëa is very simple, itis extremely difficult for stubborn conditioned souls to completely humblethemselves before the Supreme Personality of Godhead and absorb themselvestwenty-four hours a day in His loving service. The mood of loving service isanathema to belligerent conditioned souls determined to defy God and enjoy.When such stubborn conditioned souls attempt to bypass surrendering to Godthrough proud attempts at philosophical speculation, austerity, and yoga, theyare turned back to the material platform by the powerful laws of God andviolently merged into the heaving ocean of insignificance called the material world.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Nondevotees, however, cannot realize You in Your full personal feature. Nevertheless, it may be possible for them to realize Your expansion as the impersonal Supreme by cultivating direct perception of the Self within the heart. But they can do this only by purifying their mind and senses of all conceptions of material distinctions and all attachment to material sense objects. Only in this way will Your impersonal feature manifest itself to them.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">It is difficult for conditioned souls to understand all the transcendentalfeatures of the Supreme Lord. As confirmed in the First Canto ofÇrémad-Bhägavatam (1.2.11): brahmeti paramätmeti bhagavän iti çabdyate. Thetranscendental existence of God is understood progressively as the impersonaleffulgence, the localized Supersoul in one's heart, and finally the SupremePersonality of Godhead existing in His eternal abode. Lord Kåñëa'stranscendental existence is beyond the qualities of material nature. Thus herethe Lord is referred to as aguëasya, without material qualities.Even by practicing yoga or engaging in advanced philosophical speculation,one will find it very difficult to understand clearly the transcendentalexistence beyond the modes of material nature. And these processes arevirtually useless for understanding the Lord's own unlimited transcendentalqualities, which are far beyond the impersonal conception of spiritualexistence. Only by the mercy of the pure devotees of the Lord or by associatingwith the Lord Himself can one begin the process of realizing the personalfeature of God—a process that culminates in pure Kåñëa consciousness, the final and supreme perfection of knowledge.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> In time, learned philosophers or scientists might be able to count all the atoms of the earth, the particles of snow, or perhaps even the shining molecules radiating from the sun, the stars and other luminaries. But among these learned men, who could possibly count the unlimited transcendental qualities possessed by You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who have descended onto the surface of the earth for the benefit of all living entities?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé explains that Lord Kåñëa is guëätmä, "the soul ofall superior qualities," because He gives them life. For example, one may discussin an abstract way such qualities as generosity, intelligence and mercy, butthey come to life only when a living person exhibits them. Thus Lord Kåñëa isguëätmä because He descends to the material world and reestablishes religiousprinciples by exhibiting all godly qualities Himself and inspiring them inothers. A living entity who develops the transcendental qualities found in theLord receives immeasurable benefit and eventually goes with the Lord back toHis own abode, where all living beings are liberated and fully endowed with the transcendental nature.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé further explains that the Lord manifests a specificspiritual quality for the benefit of each living entity. Since there areinnumerable living entities within the confines of the material creation, theLord manifests infinite qualities. Thus every conditioned soul can appreciate the Supreme Lord in a particular way.</div>
<div class="First">The example is given here that even if the most learned scholars couldsomeday count the particles of earth, snow and light, they would still fail tounderstand the qualities of the Lord. In this example earth, snow and light areprogressively more subtle; thus it is to be understood that there is an increasingdifficulty in counting their virtually infinite particles.According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, great personalities likeLord Saìkarñaëa actually have counted the number of atoms on the earth, andeven the molecules in the entire universe. Yet even such a personality asSaìkarñaëa, who has been continuously chanting the glories of the Lord sincetime immemorial, has not even approached a final count of those glories.Lord Kåñëa exhibits His most astonishing qualities during His childhoodpastimes in Våndävana, where He steals butter from the cowherd ladies,dances with His girlfriends, and plays with His cowherd boyfriends as theirmost dear companion. Although appearing like ordinary human activities,such sublime pastimes embody Lord Kåñëa's immeasurable and innumerablebeautiful transcendental qualities, which are the life and soul of the pure devotees.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear Lord, one who earnestly waits for You to bestow Your causeless mercy upon him, all the while patiently suffering the reactions of his past misdeeds and offering You respectful obeisances with his heart, words and body, is surely eligible for liberation, for it has become his rightful claim.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Çrédhara Svämé explains in his commentary that just as a legitimateson has to simply remain alive to gain an inheritance from his father, one whosimply remains alive in Kåñëa consciousness, following the regulativeprinciples of bhakti-yoga, automatically becomes eligible to receive the mercyof the Personality of Godhead. In other words, he will be promoted to the kingdom of God.</div>
<div class="First">The word su-samékñamäëa indicates that a devotee earnestly awaits themercy of the Supreme Lord even while suffering the painful effects of previoussinful activities. Lord Kåñëa explains in the Bhagavad-gétä that a devotee whofully surrenders unto Him is no longer liable to suffer the reactions of hisprevious karma. However, because in his mind a devotee may still maintain theremnants of his previous sinful mentality, the Lord removes the last vestiges ofthe enjoying spirit by giving His devotee punishments that may sometimesresemble sinful reactions. The purpose of the entire creation of God is torectify the living entity's tendency to enjoy without the Lord, and thereforethe particular punishment given for a sinful activity is specifically designed tocurtail the mentality that produced the activity. Although a devotee hassurrendered to the Lord's devotional service, until he is completely perfect inKåñëa consciousness he may maintain a slight inclination to enjoy the falsehappiness of this world. The Lord therefore creates a particular situation toeradicate this remaining enjoying spirit. This unhappiness suffered by asincere devotee is not technically a karmic reaction; it is rather the Lord'sspecial mercy for inducing His devotee to completely let go of the material world and return home, back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="First">A sincere devotee earnestly desires to go back to the Lord's abode.Therefore he willingly accepts the Lord's merciful punishment and continuesoffering respects and obeisances to the Lord with his heart, words and body.Such a bona fide servant of the Lord, considering all hardship a small price topay for gaining the personal association of the Lord, certainly becomes alegitimate son of God, as indicated here by the words däya-bhäk. Just as onecannot approach the sun without becoming fire, one cannot approach thesupreme pure, Lord Kåñëa, without undergoing a rigid purificatory process,which may appear like suffering but which is in fact a curative treatment administered by the personal hand of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation"> My Lord, just see my uncivilized impudence!

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">A great fire produces many sparks, which are insignificant in comparison toit. Indeed, if one of the small sparks were to try to burn the original fire, theattempt would be simply ludicrous. Similarly, even the creator of the entireuniverse, Lord Brahmä, is an insignificant spark of the potency of God, andtherefore Brahmä's attempt to bewilder the Supreme Lord was certainly ludicrous.</div>
<div class="First">Brahmä here addresses Lord Kåñëa as éça, which indicates that Kåñëa is notonly the supreme master of everyone but is also specifically the master ofBrahmä, who creates the universe directly under the guidance of the Lord andwho, indeed, is born directly from the Lord's own body.Brahmä felt ashamed of his impudent attempt at deluding Lord Kåñëa, andhe was therefore perfectly willing to be punished or forgiven by the Lord,according to His decision. If Lord Kåñëa does not mercifully punish Hisdevotees when they act improperly, their foolishness will simply increase andgradually completely overwhelm their devotional sentiments. Therefore LordKåñëa kindly disciplines His devotees and maintains them on the progressive path back home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="First">In his commentary, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains thatBrahmä wanted to present the following argument to the Lord: "My dear Lord,because I have acted so badly I certainly deserve to be punished. On the otherhand, because I am so ignorant You should consider me an innocent fool andbe merciful to me. Thus, although I deserve both punishment and forgiveness,I humbly beg You to exercise tolerance in this matter and simply forgive me and show me Your mercy."</div>
<div class="First">The words näthavän iti indicate that Lord Brahmä wanted to humblyremind Lord Kåñëa that He was, after all, Brahmä's father and master andshould therefore forgive the unfortunate transgressions of His humble servant.Every conditioned soul, whether he be Lord Brahmä or an insignificant ant,falsely identifies himself with the material world and in this way forgets hiseternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Brahmä,because of his prestigious position as the cosmic creator, also tends to identifyhimself as the lord of this world, and thus he sometimes forgets his position asan insignificant servant of the Supreme Lord. Now, by Lord Kåñëa's mercy,this false identification is being rectified and Lord Brahmä is remembering hisconstitutional position as the eternal servant of God.</div>

A conditioned soul—even one so great as Brahmä, who manages theaffairs of the entire universe—cannot compare to the Personality of Godhead,for He can produce numberless universes simply by the spiritual raysemanating from the pores of His body.

<div class="First">In Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Chapter Fourteen, ÇrélaPrabhupäda further comments on this verse: "Lord Brahmä realized his actualposition. He is certainly the supreme teacher of this universe, in charge of theproduction of material nature, consisting of the complete material energy, falseego, sky, air, fire, water and earth. Such a universe may be gigantic, but it canbe measured, just as we measure our body as seven spans. Generally, everyone'spersonal bodily measurement is calculated to be seven spans of his hand. Thisparticular universe may appear to be a very gigantic body, but it is nothing but the measurement of seven spans for Lord Brahmä."</div>

ButBrahmä has an intimate relationship with the Lord because of the activities ofuniversal creation, and so he uses the prefix vi in the word vinirgata to beg theLord's special mercy.

Lord Kåñëa is Näräyaëa, the father of Brahmä, because Lord Kåñëa'splenary expansion Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, after placing Himself on the GarbhaOcean, created Brahmä from His own body.

<div class="First">Lord Brahmä here refers to his experience at the dawn of cosmic creation.As described in the Second Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Lord Brahmä tookbirth on the seat of a giant lotus whose stem emanated from the navel ofNäräyaëa. Brahmä was bewildered as to his whereabouts, function andidentity, and therefore he tried to trace out the source of the lotus stem,searching for clear information. Unable to find the Personality of Godhead, hereturned to his seat and engaged in severe austerities, having been ordered todo so by the transcendental voice of the Lord, who could be heard but notseen. After long meditation, Brahmä saw the Lord but then again lost sight ofHim. Thus Brahmä concludes that the transcendental body of the Personalityof Godhead is not material but rather an eternal, spiritual form endowed withinconceivable mystic potencies. In other words, Lord Brahmä should not havechallenged the Personality of Godhead, the Lord of all mystic power.</div>

<div class="First">Brahmä previously stated that Lord Kåñëa incarnates among the demigods,human beings, animals, fish and so on. This does not mean, however, that theLord is degraded by His incarnations. As Brahmä clarifies here, no conditionedsoul can understand the transcendental nature of the Lord's activities, whichHe enacts through His spiritual potency. Although the Lord is bhüman, thesupremely great one, He is still Bhagavän, the supremely beautiful personalityexhibiting pastimes of love in His own abode. At the same time He isParamätmä, the all-pervading Supersoul, who witnesses and sanctions all theactivities of conditioned souls. The Lord's multiple identity is explained by theterm yogeçvara. The Absolute Truth is the master of all mystic potencies, andalthough He is one and supreme, He manifests His greatness and opulence in many different ways.</div>
<div class="First">Such elevated spiritual matters can hardly be understood by foolish personsprimitively identifying themselves with the insignificant material body. Theseconditioned souls, such as atheistic scientists, consider their own puffed-upintelligence supreme. Gullibly placing their firm faith in material illusion, theyare captured by the modes of nature and driven far away from knowledge of God.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Therefore this entire universe, which like a dream is by nature unreal, nevertheless appears real, and thus it covers one's consciousness and assails one with repeated miseries. This universe appears real because it is manifested by the potency of illusion emanating from You, whose unlimited transcendental forms are full of eternal happiness and knowledge.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">As an object of enjoyment or a permanent residence for the conditionedsouls, the material universe is certainly illusion, nothing more than a dream.One may give the analogy that the vision of abundant water in a desert is nomore than a dream, although real water exists elsewhere. Similarly, the visionof home, happiness and reality within matter is certainly no better than a foolish dream in which repeated miseries appear.</div>
<div class="First">In another sense, however, the universe is real. In his commentary onVedanta-sütra, Çréla Madhväcärya has confirmed this by quoting the followingstatement from the Vedic çruti-mantras: satyaà hy evedaà viçvam asåjata. "Thisuniverse, created by the Lord, is real." The perfect authority of the Vedas thuscertifies this universe to be real; nevertheless, because our knowledge is stolenby illusion (as indicated here by the words asta-dhiñaëam), we cannot properlyunderstand this universe or the Supreme Lord who has created it. As theexpansion of Lord Kåñëa, the universe is real and is meant for being engagedin His service. One who accepts the kingdom of God as home, the LordHimself as the object of love, and the material universe as paraphernalia forbeing engaged in the Lord's service dwells within eternal reality wherever he may go within the material and spiritual worlds.</div>

You are eternal and infallible, perfect and complete, without any rival and free from all material designations. Your happiness can never be obstructed, nor have You any connection with material contamination. Indeed, You are the indestructible nectar of immortality.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Çrédhara Svämé explains how the various terms of this versedemonstrate that the transcendental body of Lord Kåñëa is free from thecharacteristics of material bodies. All material bodies go through six phases:birth, growth, maturity, reproduction, decline and destruction. But Lord Kåñëadoes not take material birth, since He is the original reality, a fact clearlyindicated here by the word adya, "original." We take our material birth withina particular material atmosphere, in material bodies that are amalgamations ofvarious material elements. Since Lord Kåñëa existed long before the creationof any material atmosphere or element, there is no question of material birth for His transcendental body.</div>
<div class="First">Similarly, the word pürëa, meaning "full and complete," refutes the conceptthat Lord Kåñëa could grow, since He is ever-existing in fullness. When one'smaterial body becomes mature, one can no longer enjoy as in youth; but thewords ajasra-sukha, "enjoying unobstructed happiness," indicate that LordKåñëa's body never reaches so-called middle age, since it is always full ofspiritual youthful bliss. The word akñara, "undiminishing," refutes thepossibility that Lord Kåñëa's body grows old or declines, and the word amåta, "immortal" negates the possibility of death.</div>
<div class="First">In other words, Lord Kåñëa's transcendental body is free from thetransformations of material bodies. The Lord does, however, createinnumerable worlds and expand Himself as innumerable living entities. Butthe Lord's so-called reproduction is completely spiritual and does not takeplace at a certain phase of bodily existence; rather, it constitutes the Lord'seternal proclivity to expand His spiritual bliss and glories.As the Lord states in çruti, pürvam eväham ihäsam: "I alone existed in thebeginning." Therefore here the Lord is called puruñaù puräëaù, "the primevalenjoyer. "This original puruña expands Himself as the Supersoul and entersevery living being. Still, He is ultimately the Absolute Truth, Kåñëa, as statedin the Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad: yaù säkñät para-brahmeti govindaàsac-cid-änanda-vigrahaà våndävana-sura-bhüruha-taläsénam. "The AbsoluteTruth Himself is Govinda, who has an eternal form of bliss and knowledge andwho is sitting beneath the shady desire trees of Våndävana." This AbsoluteTruth is beyond material ignorance and beyond even ordinary spiritualknowledge, as stated in the same Gopäla-täpané çruti: vidyävidyäbhyäàbhinnaù. Thus, in many ways the supremacy of Lord Kåñëa has beenestablished in the Vedic literature, and it is here confirmed by Lord Brahmä himself.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Those submerged in illusion see material existence as infinite, just as onewho is submerged in water sees only water all around him.

<div class="First">To be trapped in a world in which all things are born and die is certainly afearful experience. Anyone trapped in a dark place naturally becomes fearful.Since material life is always covered by the darkness of ignorance, everyconditioned soul is fearful.

Thisdark, snakelike existence called material life immediately disappears as soon asone opens his eyes to the bright light of Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation"> The conception of material bondage and the conception of liberation are both manifestations of ignorance. Being outside the scope of true knowledge, they cease to exist when one correctly understands that the pure spirit soul is distinct from matter and always fully conscious. At that time bondage and liberation no longer have any significance, just as day and night have no significance from the perspective of the sun.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Material bondage is illusion because the living entity actually has no realrelationship with the material world. Because of false ego, the conditioned soulidentifies himself with matter. Therefore so-called liberation is simply thegiving up of an illusion rather than release from actual bondage. Yet even if wethink that the suffering of material illusion is real and that liberation is thus ameaningful release from suffering, the mere absence of material existence isstill insignificant compared to the achievement of factual spiritual life, whichis the positive eternal reality opposed to the negative illusion of material life.Ultimately, Kåñëa consciousness, or pure love of Godhead, is the onlysignificant, meaningful and permanent status for every living entity.Since the darkness of night is caused by the absence of the sun, one wouldnot experience night within the sun itself, nor would one experienceindividual days separated by nights. Similarly, within the pure living entitythere is no material darkness and thus no experience of liberation from suchdarkness. When the conditioned soul comes to this platform of pureconsciousness, he becomes fit to associate with the supreme pure, thePersonality of Godhead Himself, in the Lord's own abode.</div>

Sometimes suchfools consider Lord Kåñëa to be one of many individual souls who togetherconstitute a single impersonal spiritual entity. Unfortunately, such speculatorsare not inclined to hear from the Lord Himself or from the Lord's authorizedrepresentatives, such as Lord Brahmä.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">One may argue that a person should cultivate self-realization and at thesame time pursue sense gratification for the material body. This proposition isherein refuted by the example of misidentifying a rope as a snake. One whomistakes a rope for a snake becomes fearful and thinks of the so-called snake.But upon discovering that the so-called snake is actually a rope, he experiencesa different emotion—relief—and can then ignore the rope. Similarly, becausewe misunderstand the material body to be the self, we are experiencing manyemotions in relation to the body. Upon discovering, however, that the body issimply a bag of material chemicals, we carefully note how this illusion wascreated and then lose interest in the body. Discovering that we are actually aneternal soul within the body, we naturally focus our attention on that real self.Those who are saintly and wise always cultivate Kåñëa consciousness,spiritual knowledge, having transcended the foolish misidentification of thebody as the self. Such Kåñëa conscious persons go on to realize the SupremePersonality of Godhead, who dwells within the material body as theSupersoul—the witness and guide of every living entity. Realization of theSupersoul and the individual soul is so pleasing and satisfying that aself-realized person automatically gives up everything irrelevant to his spiritual advancement.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This verse indicates that Lord Brahmä desires to take birth even as thesmallest blade of grass in Våndävana so that the holy residents of the Lord'sabode may walk upon his head and bless him with the dust of their feet. Beingrealistic, Lord Brahmä does not aspire to directly achieve the dust of LordKåñëa's feet; rather, he aspires for the mercy of the Lord's devotees. ÇrélaViçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains that Brahmä is willing to take birtheven as a stone in a paved footpath in the Lord's abode. Since Brahmä is thecreator of the entire universe, we can just imagine the glorious position of the residents of Våndävana.</div>
<div class="First">The Lord's devotees achieve their exalted position by unalloyed devotionand love. One cannot achieve such spiritual opulence by any puffed-upmaterial process of personal improvement. In Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality ofGodhead, Çréla Prabhupäda reveals the mind of Brahmä as follows: "But if I amnot so fortunate as to take birth within the forest of Våndävana, I beg to beallowed to take birth outside the immediate area of Våndävana so that whenthe devotees go out they will walk over me. Even that would be a great fortunefor me. I am just aspiring for a birth in which I will be smeared by the dust of the devotees' feet."</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Apparently, the residents of Våndävana, the abode of Lord Kåñëa, aresimple householders engaged in ordinary affairs such as herding cows, cooking,rearing children and performing religious ceremonies. However, all theseactivities are intensely engaged in the loving service of Lord Kåñëa. Theresidents of Våndävana perform all activities in pure Kåñëa consciousness andthus exist on the most exalted platform of liberated life. Otherwise, the sameactivities performed without Kåñëa consciousness constitute ordinary bondage to the material world.</div>
<div class="First">Thus, one should not misunderstand the exalted position of the residents ofVåndävana, nor should one consider oneself highly religious simply becauseone performs ordinary domestic affairs very enthusiastically, but withoutKåñëa consciousness. By focusing our passionate attachment on our family andsociety, we are completely deviated from the progressive path of Kåñëaconsciousness. Conversely, if we engage our family in the loving service of theLord, our endeavors to maintain our family become part and parcel of our progressive spiritual duties.</div>
<div class="First">In conclusion, by studying the extraordinary status of the residents ofVåndävana, we can see that the essential quality of their lives is pure Kåñëaconsciousness—the rendering of loving service to the Lord without a trace ofmaterial desire or mental speculation. Such loving service to the originalPersonality of Godhead immediately creates the atmosphere of Çré Våndävana-dhäma, the kingdom of God.</div>

<div class="First">In his Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çréla Prabhupäda hasquoted Lord Brahmä as follows: "My dear Lord, although You are the SupremeLord of all creation, I sometimes falsely think that I am the master of thisuniverse. I may be master of this universe, but there are innumerableuniverses, and there are also innumerable Brahmäs who preside over theseuniverses. But actually You are the master of them all.

<div class="First">The words sarvaà tvaà vetsi sarva-dåk are very significant here. Lord Kåñëaknows everything and sees everything, and therefore Lord Brahmä did notneed to remain in Våndävana to maintain his personal loving contact with theLord. In fact, as the creator of the universe, Lord Brahmä was somewhat out ofplace in the simple, blissful atmosphere of Våndävana, where Lord Kåñëa wasexhibiting His supreme opulences in herding cows, enjoying picnics, playing games and so on.</div>
<div class="First">Upon seeing the intense love the residents of Våndävana had for LordKåñëa, Brahmä felt unqualified to remain there. He was not eager to give upthe Lord's association, but he felt it better to return to his personal devotionalservice in Brahmaloka. Somewhat embarrassed and unhappy over his foolishattempt at bewildering the Lord, Brahmä preferred to resume histranscendental loving service rather than try to enjoy the Lord's presence.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé, Lord Brahmä is here engaged in theecstasy of näma-saìkértana, glorifying various holy names of Lord Kåñëa thatindicate His variegated pastimes. Lord Kåñëa expertly suppressed the demoniacpopulation of the earth, which became unbearable with the advent ofdemoniac politicians like Kaàsa, Jaräsandha and Çiçupäla. Similarly, inmodern society there are many so-called God-fearing people who are actuallyattracted to demoniac existence. Such persons become enlivened with thesetting of the sun and go out in the darkness to enjoy life in restaurants,nightclubs, discotheques, hotels and so on, which are all simply meant forillicit sex, intoxication, gambling and meat-eating. Then there are those whoopenly defy God and His laws, declaring themselves atheists and demons. Boththe covert and the overt enemies of the Lord constitute an unholy burden forthe earth, and Lord Kåñëa descends to expertly remove this burden.Here Lord Brahmä indirectly states that Lord Kåñëa should removeBrahmä's own subtle atheism, which had led him to try to exert illusory powerover Lord Kåñëa. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, LordBrahmä, in his shame, felt himself to be like a brahma-räkñasa from Satyalokawho had come to the earth to disturb Lord Kåñëa and His intimate friends andcalves. Brahmä is lamenting that although Lord Kåñëa is most exalted, theLord of all lords, because He had appeared before Brahmä in such a simple andinnocent feature—decorated with a stick, a conchshell, ornaments, red clay, apeacock feather and so on, and sporting with His cowherdboyfriends—Brahmä dared to challenge Him. Concerning Brahmä's prayers, ofwhich this verse is the conclusion, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura states,"May these prayers of Brahmä, which take away all doubts and broadcast allthe definitive conclusions of devotional service, become the expertcraftsmanship of the foundation of my consciousness."</div>

First Brahmä had to complete his personal devotional service ofuniversal creation; then he could come to Våndävana and get the mercy of theinhabitants there. In other words, a devotee should always be attentive toexecuting his personal devotional service properly. This is more important than trying to live in the Lord's abode.</div>

<div class="Translation"> After granting His son Brahmä permission to leave, the Supreme Personality of Godhead took the calves, who were still where they had been a year earlier, and brought them to the riverbank, where He had been taking His meal and where His cowherd boyfriends remained just as before.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The word sva-bhuvam, "to His own son," indicates that Lord Kåñëa forgavethe offense Brahmä had committed and treated him with affection, as His son.It is stated in this verse that the original cowherd boyfriends and calves weresituated just as before: near the bank of the Yamunä River and in the forest,respectively. Previously the calves had disappeared within the forest and LordKåñëa had gone to search for them. Not finding them, the Lord had returnedto the riverbank to discuss the situation with His cowherd boyfriends, but theyhad also disappeared. Now the cows were once again in the forest and theboyfriends once again on the bank of the river, ready to take their lunch.According to Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé, the calves and boys remained in theforest and on the riverbank, respectively, for one full year. Lord Brahmä didnot actually take them away to another place. By the Lord's omnipotentillusory energy, the gopés and other residents of Våndävana did not notice thecalves and boys, nor did the calves and boys notice the passing of a year's timeor feel any hunger, cold or thirst. All this was part of the pastime arranged bythe Lord's illusory potency. Lord Brahmä thought, "I have kept all the boys andcalves of Gokula sleeping on the bed of my mystic potency, and to this veryday they have not risen. A similar number of boys and calves have beenplaying with Kåñëa for one whole year, yet they are different from the onesillusioned by my mystic potency. Who are they? Where did they come from?"Nothing is invisible to the Supreme Lord. Thus Lord Kåñëa appeared to besearching for the calves and boys only to enact the dramatic pastime ofbewildering Lord Brahmä. After Brahmä surrendered and offered prayers,Lord Kåñëa returned to the original boys and calves, who appeared exactly asbefore, although their size had somewhat increased because of one year's growth.</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, since Lord Kåñëa wasplaying exactly like an innocent young cowherd boy in Våndävana, afterfour-headed Brahmä offered his prayers the Lord maintained His role as ayoung cowherd boy and thus remained silent before Brahmä. Kåñëa's silenceindicates the following thoughts: "Where did this four-headed Brahmä comefrom? What is he doing? What are these words he keeps on speaking? I am busylooking for My calves. I am just a cowherd boy and do not understand all this."Lord Brahmä had considered Lord Kåñëa an ordinary cowherd boy and hadtreated Him as such. After accepting Brahmä's prayers, Kåñëa continued toplay as a cowherd boy and thus did not answer the four-headed Brahmä.Rather, Kåñëa was more interested in rejoining His cowherd boyfriends for the picnic lunch on the bank of the Yamunä River.</div>

<div class="First">Sometimes modern thinkers become puzzled when they study thepsychology of moral behavior. Although every living entity is inclined towardself-preservation, as stated here, sometimes a person voluntarily sacrifices hisown apparent interest through philanthropic or patriotic activities, such asgiving his money for the benefit of others or giving his life for the nationalinterest. Such so-called selfless behavior appears to contradict the principle of material self-centeredness and self-preservation.</div>
<div class="First">As explained in this verse, however, a living entity serves his society,nation, family and so on only because these objects of affection represent theexpanded concept of false ego. A patriot sees himself as a great servitor of agreat nation, and thus he sacrifices his life to gratify his sense of egotism.Similarly, it is common knowledge that a man feels great pleasure by thinkingthat he is sacrificing everything to please his dear wife and children. A manderives great egotistic pleasure by seeing himself as a selfless well-wisher of hisso-called family and community. Thus, to gratify his proud sense of false ego, aman is prepared even to lay down his life. This apparently contradictorybehavior is yet another demonstration of the bewilderment of material life,which has neither rhyme nor reason, being a manifestation of gross ignorance of the nonmaterial soul.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The word mamatä-bhäk is very significant here. An ordinary, foolish personthinks, "I am this body." A more discriminating, intelligent person thinks,"This is my body." In the literature and folklore of ordinary people we find thecommon theme of an old, decrepit person dreaming of obtaining a new, youngbody. Thus, even ordinary persons pick up the notion of self-realization,instinctively understanding that it is possible for the soul to exist in many different bodies.</div>
<div class="First">As the body of an intelligent person becomes old and useless, he stronglydesires to live, even when he knows that his body cannot live much longer.This indicates he is gradually becoming aware that his self is more importantthan his body. Thus simply the desire for life can indirectly bring one to apreliminary understanding of self-realization. And in this case as well, one'sbasic attachment is to one's own self and not to that which supposedly belongs to oneself.</div>
<div class="First">It may be pointed out that the entire discussion between King Parékñit andÇukadeva Gosvämé regarding the dearness of one's own self is ultimately meantfor broaching the subject of why the cows and cowherd ladies of Våndävanaconsidered Kåñëa more dear than their own selves and certainly more dearthan their own offspring.

<div class="First">In the Caitanya-caritämåta, Madhya-léla, Chapter Twenty, Text 162, ÇrélaPrabhupäda comments on this verse as follows: "Parékñit Mahäräja askedÇukadeva Gosvämé why Kåñëa was so beloved by the residents of Våndävana,who loved Him even more than their own offspring or life itself. At that time,Çukadeva Gosvämé replied that everyone's ätmä, or soul, is very, very dear,especially to all living entities who have accepted material bodies. However,that ätmä, the spirit soul, is part and parcel of Kåñëa. For this reason, Kåñëa isvery dear to every living entity. Everyone's body is very dear to oneself, andone wants to protect the body by all means because within the body the soul isliving. Due to the intimate relationship between the soul and the body, thebody is important and dear to everyone. Similarly, the soul, being part andparcel of Kåñëa, the Supreme Lord, is very, very dear to all living entities.Unfortunately, the soul forgets his constitutional position and thinks he isonly the body (dehätma-buddhi). Thus the soul is subjected to the rules andregulations of material nature. When a living entity, by his intelligence,reawakens his attraction for Kåñëa, he can understand that he is not the bodybut part and parcel of Kåñëa. Thus filled with knowledge, he no longer laborsunder attachment to the body and everything related to the body (janasyamoho 'yam ahaà mameti [SB 5.5.8]). Material existence, wherein one thinks, 'Iam the body, and this belongs to me,' is also illusory. One must redirect hisattraction to Kåñëa. Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.2.7) states,</div>

<div class="First">Everything exists within Lord Kåñëa, and Lord Kåñëa exists withineverything. Still, the order of progression is always from the energetic to theexpanded energy. Lord Kåñëa is the original identity, from whom all otheridentities emanate. He is the supreme energetic, from whom all categories anddimensions of energy become manifest. Thus, our personal bodies, self, family,friends, nation, planet, universe and so on are all manifestations of theSupreme Lord, who expands Himself through His personal potencies. LordKåñëa is certainly the supreme object of our love and attraction, and otherobjects, such as body, family and home, should be secondary objects of ouraffection. Moreover, a close analytic study of the actual situation will revealthat even the secondary objects of love are also manifestations of Lord Kåñëa.The conclusion is that Lord Kåñëa is our only friend and object of love.In his Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çréla Prabhupädacomments on this verse as follows: "Without being an expansion of Kåñëa,nothing can be attractive. Whatever is attractive within the cosmicmanifestation is due to Kåñëa. Kåñëa is therefore the reservoir of all pleasure.The active principle of everything is Kåñëa, and highly elevatedtranscendentalists see everything in connection with Him. In theCaitanya-caritämåta it is stated that a mahä-bhägavata, a highly advanceddevotee, sees Kåñëa as the active principle in all movable and immovable livingentities.

<div class="First">According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, this verse summarizes the knowledgepresented in this section of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet aredescribed as pallava, flower buds, because they are most tender and of a pinkishhue. According to Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé, the word pallava also indicatesthat Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet are just like desire trees, which can fulfill all thedesires of the Lord's pure devotees. Even exalted devotees like Çré Närada, whoare themselves the great shelter for the conditioned souls in this universe,personally take shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Çré Kåñëa. Thus it is naturalthat when Lord Kåñëa manifested Himself as all the young boys and calves ofVåndävana, their parents were more attracted to them than previously.

<div class="Chapnum">15. The Killing of Dhenuka, the Ass Demon</div>
<div class="First">This chapter describes how Lord Balaräma and Lord Kåñëa, while tendingTheir cows in the pastures of Våndävana, killed Dhenukäsura, enabled theresidents of Våndävana to eat the fruits of the täla trees and saved the young cowherds from Käliya's poison.</div>
<div class="First">Revealing Their boyhood (paugaëòa) phase of pastimes, Räma and Kåñëawere one day bringing the cows to pasture when They entered an attractiveforest decorated with a clear lake. There They began playing forest sportsalong with Their friends. Pretending to tire, Lord Baladeva laid His head uponthe lap of a cowherd boy and rested as Lord Kåñëa helped relieve His elderbrother's fatigue by massaging His feet. Then Kåñëa also placed His head onthe lap of a cowherd boy to rest, and another cowherd boy massaged His feet.In this way Kåñëa, Balaräma and Their cowherd friends enjoyed various pastimes.</div>
<div class="First">During this play, Çrédämä, Subala, Stoka-kåñëa and other cowherd boysdescribed to Räma and Kåñëa a wicked and irrepressible demon namedDhenuka, who had assumed the form of a jackass and was living in theTälavana forest near Govardhana Hill. This forest was full of many varieties ofsweet fruits. But fearing this demon, no one dared try to relish the taste ofthose fruits, and thus someone had to kill the demon and all his associates.Lord Räma and Lord Kåñëa, hearing of the situation, set off for this forest to fulfill the desire of Their companions.</div>
<div class="First">Arriving at the Tälavana, Lord Balaräma shook many fruits out of the palmtrees, and as soon as He did so the jackass demon, Dhenuka, ran swiftly toattack Him. But Balaräma grabbed his hind legs with one hand, whirled himaround and threw him into the top of a tree, thus slaying him. All ofDhenukäsura's friends, overcome by fury, then rushed to attack, but Räma andKåñëa took hold of them one by one, swung them around and killed them,until the disturbance was finally finished. When Kåñëa and Balaräma returnedto the cowherd community, Yaçodä and Rohiëé placed Them on theirrespective laps. They kissed Their faces, fed Them with finely prepared food and then put Them to bed.</div>
<div class="First">Some days later Lord Kåñëa went with His friends, but without His olderbrother, to the banks of the Kälindé in order to tend the cows. The cows andcowherd boys became very thirsty and drank some water from the Kälindé. Butit had been contaminated with poison, and they all fell unconscious on theriverbank. Kåñëa then brought them back to life by the merciful rain of Hisglance, and all of them, regaining their consciousness, appreciated His great mercy.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Çukadeva Gosvämé said: When Lord Räma and Lord Kåñëa attained the age of paugaëòa [six to ten] while living in Våndävana, the cowherd men allowed Them to take up the task of tending the cows. Engaging thus in the company of Their friends, the two boys rendered the land of Våndävana most auspicious by imprinting upon it the marks of Their lotus feet.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa wanted to encourage His cowherd boyfriends, who had beenswallowed by Aghäsura and then stolen by Lord Brahmä. Therefore the Lorddecided to bring them into the palm-tree forest called Tälavana, where therewere many delicious ripe fruits. Since Lord Kåñëa's spiritual body hadapparently grown slightly in age and strength, the senior men of Våndävana,headed by Nanda Mahäräja, decided to promote Kåñëa from the task ofherding calves to the status of a regular cowherd boy. He would now take careof the full-grown cows, bulls and oxen. Out of great affection, Nanda Mahäräjahad previously considered Kåñëa too small and immature to take care offull-grown cows and bulls. It is stated in the Kärttika-mähätmya section of the Padma Puräëa:</div>

From that day, Lord Väsudeva served as acowherd, whereas previously He had tended the calves."The word padaiù indicates that Lord Kåñëa blessed the earth by walking onher surface with His lotus feet. The Lord wore no shoes or other footgear butwalked barefoot in the forest, giving great anxiety to the girls of Våndävana,who feared that His soft lotus feet would be injured.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé has explained the various meanings of the wordmädhava as follows: Mädhava normally indicates Kåñëa to be "the Lord, who isthe consort of the goddess of fortune, Lakñmé." This name also implies thatLord Kåñëa descended in the dynasty of Madhu. Since the spring season is alsoknown as Mädhava, it is understood that as soon as Lord Kåñëa entered theVåndävana forest, it automatically exhibited all the opulences of spring,becoming filled with flowers, breezes and a celestial atmosphere. Anotherreason Lord Kåñëa is known as Mädhava is that He enjoys His pastimes in madhu, the taste of conjugal love.</div>
<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa would loudly sound His flute as He entered the forest of ÇréVåndävana, thus giving inconceivable bliss to all the residents of Hishometown, Vraja-dhäma. These simple pastimes of playfully entering theforest, playing on the flute and so forth were performed daily in the spiritual land of Våndävana.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa saw that the Våndävana forest was giving pleasure to all fivesenses. The bees, birds, and animals made charming sounds that brought sweetpleasure to the ears. The wind was faithfully rendering service to the Lord byblowing throughout the forest, carrying the cool moisture of a transparent lakeand thus giving pleasure to the sense of touch. By the sweetness of the wind,even the sense of taste was being stimulated, and the fragrance of lotus flowerswas bringing pleasure to the nostrils. And the entire forest was endowed withheavenly beauty, which was giving spiritual bliss to the eyes. Çréla ViçvanäthaCakravarté Öhäkura has thus explained the significance of this verse.</div>

In fact, all thecreatures of Våndävana, including the trees and cows, were great souls whocould personally associate with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Butbecause of ecstatic sentiments of separation, the trees considered themselves inignorance and thus tried to purify themselves by bowing down at the lotus feetof Kåñëa and Balaräma. Lord Kåñëa understanding their mentality,simultaneously glanced at them with affection and praised their devotional service before His older brother, Balaräma.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The word güòham is significant in this verse. It indicates that although theSupreme Personality of Godhead in His form of Kåñëa or Balaräma appearslike an ordinary human being within the material world, great sages alwaysrecognize the Lord as the Supreme Absolute Truth. All the transcendentalforms of Godhead are eternal and full of bliss and knowledge, exactly theopposite of our material bodies, which are temporary and full of misery and ignorance.</div>
<div class="First">One meaning of the word tértha is "the means for crossing beyond materialexistence." Simply by hearing the glories of the Supreme Lord or by chantingthem, one immediately comes to the spiritual platform, beyond materialexistence. Thus the Lord's transcendental glories are here described as a térthafor everyone in the world. The word gäyantaù indicates that great sages give uptheir vows of silence and other selfish processes to glorify the activities of theSupreme Lord. Real silence means to not speak nonsense, to limit one's verbalactivities to those sounds, statements and discussions relevant to the loving service of the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="First">The word anagha indicates that the Supreme Lord never performs sinful oroffensive activities. The word also indicates that the Lord immediately excusesa sin or offense committed by a sincere loving devotee who may accidentallydeviate from the Lord's service. In the specific context of this verse, the wordanagha indicates that Lord Balaräma was not disturbed by the bees who wereconstantly following Him (anupatham). The Lord blessed them by saying, "Obees, come into My confidential grove and feel free to taste its fragrance."</div>

<div class="First">The word adya, "now," indicates the time of Lord Balaräma and LordKåñëa's appearance on the earth. In His form of Varäha, Lord Kåñëa personallysaved the earth, and, indeed, the earth is understood to rest perpetually on thepotency of Çeña. Both Varäha and Çeña are expansions of Balaräma, who isHimself an expansion of Lord Kåñëa, the original Personality of Godhead.Lord Kåñëa's statement that "this earth has now become most fortunate"(dhanyeyam adya dharaëé) indicates that nothing can equal the blessings of theSupreme Personality of Godhead in His personal form as Kåñëa, appearingsimultaneously with His plenary expansion, Balaräma. The compound wordkarajäbhimåñöäù, "touched by Your fingernails," indicates that as Kåñëa andBalaräma would move through the forest They would pick fruits and flowersfrom the trees, bushes and creepers and use this paraphernalia in Theirpleasure pastimes. Sometimes They would break leaves off the plants and use them with the flowers to decorate Their bodies.</div>
<div class="First">Kåñëa and Balaräma would glance lovingly and mercifully at all the rivers,hills and creatures in Våndävana. But the blessing received by thegopés—being embraced directly between the Lord's arms—was the supremebenediction, desired even by the goddess of fortune herself. The goddess offortune, who lives in Vaikuëöha on the chest of Lord Näräyaëa, once desiredto be embraced on the chest of Çré Kåñëa, and thus she performed severeausterities to achieve this blessing. Çré Kåñëa informed her that her actualplace was in Vaikuëöha and that it was not possible for her to dwell upon Hischest in Våndävana. Therefore she begged Kåñëa to allow her to remain on Hischest in the form of a golden line, and He granted her this benediction.

Sometimes Lord Kåñëa would imitate the chattering of a parrot, sometimes, with a sweet voice, the call of a cuckoo, and sometimes the cooing of swans. Sometimes He vigorously imitated the dancing of a peacock, making His cowherd boyfriends laugh.

<div class="First">Unfortunate persons cannot appreciate the blissful pastimes of theSupreme Lord. In this connection Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains that theSupreme Lord possesses unlimited potency and strength, as expressed here bythe word anante. The Lord exhibits a tiny fraction of His power according tothe need of a particular situation. Lord Balaräma desired to vanquish the gangof demoniac asses who had unlawfully seized the Tälavana forest, andtherefore He exhibited just enough divine opulence to easily kill Dhenukäsura and the other demons.</div>

<div class="First">Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé makes the following comment on this verse: "It isstated here that the ass demons first attacked Kåñëa and then Balaräma(kåñëaà ca rämaà ca). One reason for this is that the demons, having seen theprowess of Lord Balaräma, thought it wise to attack Kåñëa first. Or it may bethat out of affection for His elder brother, Lord Kåñëa placed Himself betweenBalaräma and the ass demons. The words kåñëaà ca rämaà ca may also beunderstood to indicate that Lord Balaräma, out of affection for His younger brother, went to Lord Kåñëa's side.</div>

<div class="Chapnum">16. Kåñëa Chastises the Serpent Käliya</div>
<div class="First">This chapter describes Lord Çré Kåñëa's pastime of subduing the serpentKäliya within the lake adjoining the river Yamunä and His showing mercy toKäliya in response to the prayers offered by Käliya's wives, the Näga-patnés.To restore the purity of the Yamunä's waters, which had been contaminatedby Käliya's poison, Lord Kåñëa climbed into a kadamba tree on the riverbankand jumped into the water. Then He began fearlessly playing within the waterlike a maddened elephant. Käliya could not tolerate Kåñëa's trespassing uponhis personal residence, and the serpent quickly went up to the Lord and bitHim on the chest. When Kåñëa's friends saw this, they fell down on the groundunconscious. At that time all sorts of evil omens appeared in Vraja, such asearth tremors, falling stars and the trembling of various creatures' left limbs.The residents of Våndävana thought, "Today Kåñëa went to the forestwithout Balaräma, so we do not know what great misfortune may have befallenHim." Thinking in this way, they traced the path of Kåñëa's footprints to thebank of the Yamunä. Within the water of the lake adjoining the river they sawLord Kåñëa, the very essence of their lives, enwrapped in the coils of a blacksnake. The residents thought the three worlds had become empty, and they allprepared to enter the water. But Lord Balaräma checked them, knowing well the power of Kåñëa.</div>
<div class="First">Then Lord Kåñëa, seeing how disturbed His friends and relatives hadbecome, expanded His body greatly and forced the serpent to loosen his gripand release Him. Next the Lord began playfully dancing about on the serpent'shoods. By this wonderful, boisterous dancing, Çré Kåñëa trampled the serpent'sone thousand hoods until his body slackened. Vomiting blood from his mouths,Käliya finally understood that Kåñëa was the primeval personality, LordNäräyaëa, the spiritual master of all moving and nonmoving creatures, and he took shelter of Him.</div>
<div class="First">Seeing how very weary Käliya had become, his wives, the Näga-patnés,bowed down at Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet. Then they offered Him various prayersin hopes of gaining their husband's freedom: "It is quite fitting that You havebrought our cruel husband to this condition. Indeed, by Your anger he hasgained great benefit. What piety Käliya must have amassed in his previouslives! Today he has borne upon his head the dust of the lotus feet of thePersonality of Godhead, the attainment of which is difficult for even themother of the universe, goddess Lakñmé. Please kindly forgive the offenseKäliya has committed out of ignorance, and allow him to live."Satisfied by the Näga-patnés' prayers, Kåñëa released Käliya, who slowlyregained his sensory and vital powers. Then Käliya, in a distressed voice,acknowledged the offense he had committed, and finally he offered Kåñëamany prayers and said he was ready to accept His command. Kåñëa told him toleave the Yamunä lake with his family and return to Ramaëaka Island.</div>

As Lord Caitanya advised in HisÇikñäñöaka, one has to execute devotional service by humbly chanting the HareKåñëa mantra, thinking oneself lower than the straw in the street and notexpecting honor for oneself but offering all kinds of honor to others. TheNäga-patnés were astonished that, although Käliya had the body of a serpent asthe result of grievous sinful activities, at the same time he was in contact withthe Lord to the extent that the Lord's lotus feet were touching his hoods.Certainly this was not the ordinary result of pious activities.

<div class="First">The word guëa conveys various meanings: the three basic qualities ofmaterial nature, i.e., goodness, passion and ignorance; excellent qualities onemanifests because of piety and spiritual achievement; or the internal senses,such as the mind and intelligence. The word pradépäya means "unto Him whomanifests or illumines." Thus here the Näga-patnés are addressing the SupremeLord as "He who manifests all material and spiritual qualities and who causesthe living entities to be conscious." One can see the Lord by going beyond thescreen of material nature, and therefore He is called guëätma-cchädanäya. Ifone methodically and intelligently studies the functioning of the materialqualities, he will ultimately conclude that there is a Supreme Personality ofGodhead and that He exhibits His illusory potency to bewilder those who do not surrender unto Him.</div>
<div class="First">The Lord is never affected by the modes of nature, being their witness, andthus He is called guëa-drañöre. The word sva indicates "one's own," and thussva-saàvide means that Lord Kåñëa can be known only by His own people, thedevotees, and also that ultimately only the Lord can know Himself perfectly.Therefore we should take Lord Kåñëa's instructions in Bhagavad-gétä andimmediately come to the right conclusion: full surrender to the Lord's lotusfeet. Thus we should humbly glorify the Lord, following the example of the Näga-patnés.</div>

Then, taking his wives, friends and children, he went to his island in the sea. The very moment Käliya left, the Yamunä was immediately restored to her original condition, free from poison and full of nectarean water. This happened by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who was manifesting a humanlike form to enjoy His pastimes.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has commented extensively on thisverse. To explain the word maëibhiù—"(Käliya worshiped the Lord) withjewels"—the äcärya has quoted from the Çré Rädhä-kåñëa-gaëoddeça-dépikä, by Rüpa Gosvämé, as follows:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kaustubhäkhyo maëir yena</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">praviçya hradam auragam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">käliya-preyasi-våndahastair</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ätmopahäritaù</div>
<div class="First">"The Lord had made His Kaustubha gem enter the serpent's lake, and then Hearranged for it to be presented to Himself by the hands of Käliya's wives." Inother words, because Lord Kåñëa wanted to act just like an ordinary humanbeing, He made the transcendental Kaustubha gem invisible and caused it toenter within Käliya's treasury. Then when the appropriate moment came forKäliya to worship the Lord with many different jewels and ornaments, theserpent's wives, unaware of the Lord's transcendental trick, presented Himwith the Kaustubha gem, thinking it was simply one of the jewels in their possession.</div>
<div class="First">The äcärya has further commented that the reason Lord Kåñëa is describedin this verse as garuòa-dhvaja, "He whose flag is marked by the symbol of Hiscarrier, Garuòa," is that Käliya also desired to become Lord Kåñëa's carrier.Garuòa and the serpents are originally related as brothers, and thereforeKäliya wanted to indicate to Lord Kåñëa, "If You ever have to go to a distantplace, You should also think of me as Your personal carrier. I am the servant ofYour servant, and in the wink of an eye I can travel hundreds of millions ofyojanas." Thus the Puräëas narrate that in the course of Lord Kåñëa's eternalcycle of pastimes, when Kaàsa orders the Lord to come to Mathurä, He sometimes goes there mounted upon Käliya.</div>
<div class="First">Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Sixteenth Chapter, of theÇrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Kåñëa Chastises the Serpent Käliya."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">17. The History of Käliya</div>
<div class="First">This chapter describes how Käliya left the island of the snakes and how thesleeping residents of Våndävana were saved from a forest fire.When King Parékñit inquired about Käliya's leaving Ramaëaka Island, theabode of the serpents, and about why Garuòa acted inimically toward him, ÇréÇukadeva Gosvämé replied as follows: All the serpents on the island wereafraid of being devoured by Garuòa. To placate him, every month they wouldleave various offerings for him at the foot of a banyan tree. But Käliya,puffed-up as he was with false pride, would eat these offerings himself. Hearingof this, Garuòa became furious and went to kill Käliya, whereupon the snakebegan biting the great bird. Garuòa fiercely beat him with his wing, sendingKäliya fleeing for his life to a lake adjoining the Yamunä River.Prior to the above incident, Garuòa had once come to the Yamunä andstarted eating some fish. Saubhari Åñi had tried to stop him, but Garuòa,agitated by hunger, had refused to heed the sage's prohibitions, and in responsethe sage had cursed Garuòa that if he ever came there again he wouldimmediately die. Käliya had heard of this, and thus he lived there without fear. In the end, however, he was driven out by Çré Kåñëa.</div>
<div class="First">When Lord Balaräma and all the residents of Våndävana saw Çré Kåñëa riseup out of the lake, beautifully decorated with many different gems andornaments, they embraced Him in great pleasure. The spiritual masters, priestsand learned brähmaëas then told Nanda Mahäräja, the king of the cowherds,that although his son had been caught in the grips of Käliya, it was by the king's good fortune that He was now free again.</div>
<div class="First">Because the people of Våndävana were quite worn out by hunger, thirst andfatigue, they spent that night on the banks of the Yamunä. In the middle ofthe night, a fire happened to blaze up within the forest, which had become dryduring the hot season. As the fire surrounded the sleeping inhabitants ofVåndävana, they suddenly awoke and rushed to Çré Kåñëa for protection. Thenthe unlimitedly powerful Lord Çré Kåñëa, seeing His dear relatives and friendsso distressed, immediately swallowed up the terrible forest fire.</div>

According to this reading, a group of human beings hadfallen under the control of the serpents and were prone to be eaten by them.To avoid this, the human beings would make a monthly offering to theserpents, who in turn would offer a portion of that offering to Garuòa so thathe would not eat them. The particular translation given above is based on thecommentary of Çréla Sanätana Gosvämé and the translation by ÇrélaPrabhupäda in his Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çukadeva Gosvämé is now explaining why Garuòa could not approach thelake in the Yamunä River. It is the nature of birds to eat fish, and thus, by thearrangement of the Lord, the great bird Garuòa does not commit any offenseby nourishing himself with fish. On the other hand, Saubhari Muni'sforbidding a much greater personality to eat his normal food did constitute anoffense. According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, Saubharicommitted two offenses: first, he dared to give an order to a supremely exaltedsoul like Garuòa, and second, he obstructed Garuòa from satisfying his desire.</div>

<div class="First">In this regard Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains that when ourso-called compassion does not tally with the order of the Supreme Lord, itmerely causes a disturbance.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The äcäryas explain in this regard that because of Saubhari Muni's materialattachment and affection for a fish, he failed to see the situation from thespiritual viewpoint. The Ninth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam describes hisfalldown for this offense. Because of false pride, Saubhari Muni lost his powerof austerity, and with it his spiritual beauty and happiness. When Garuòa cameto the Yamunä, Saubhari Muni thought, "Although he may be a personalassociate of the Supreme Lord, I will still curse him and even kill him if hedisobeys my order." Such an offensive attitude against an exalted Vaiñëava will certainly destroy one's auspicious position in life.</div>
<div class="First">As the Ninth Canto describes, Saubhari Muni married many beautifulwomen, and suffered greatly in their association. But because he had oncebecome glorious by taking shelter of the Yamunä River in Çré Våndävana, he was ultimately delivered.</div>

While playinghappily in Våndävana, Lord Baladeva climbed up on the shoulders of thedemon Pralamba and struck his head with His fist, destroying him.Çré Våndävana, where Kåñëa and Balaräma enacted Their pastimes, waseven during the summer decorated with all the qualities of spring. At that timeLord Çré Kåñëa would become absorbed in various sports, surrounded byBalaräma and all the cowherd boys. One day they were intently dancing,singing and playing when a demon named Pralamba entered their midst,disguised as a cowherd boy. The omniscient Lord Kåñëa saw through thedisguise, but even as He thought of how to kill the demon, He treated him as a friend.</div>
<div class="First">Kåñëa then suggested to His young friends and Baladeva that they play agame involving contending parties. Taking the role of leaders, Kåñëa andBalaräma divided the boys into two groups and determined that the loserswould have to carry the winners on their shoulders. Thus when Çrédämä andVåñabha, members of Balaräma's party, were victorious, Kåñëa and another boyin His party carried them on their shoulders. Pralambäsura thought that theunconquerable Lord Çré Kåñëa would be too great an opponent to contendwith, so the demon fought with Balaräma instead and was defeated. TakingLord Balaräma on his back, Pralambäsura began to walk away very swiftly. ButBalaräma became as heavy as Mount Sumeru, and the demon, unable to carryHim, had to reveal his true, demoniac form. When Balaräma saw this terribleform, He struck the demon a ferocious blow on the head with His fist. Thisblow shattered Pralambäsura's head just as lightning bolts hurled by the king ofthe demigods shatter mountains. The demon repeatedly vomited blood andthen fell upon the ground. When the cowherd boys saw Lord Balaräma return,they joyfully embraced and congratulated Him as the demigods showeredgarlands of flowers from the heavens and glorified Him.</div>

Also because the demon had appeared as a cowherdboyfriend of Kåñëa's and because Kåñëa had accepted him as a friend, Baladevawas slightly apprehensive about killing him. Balaräma could also have beenworried that since this cowherd boy was actually a demon in disguise, at thatvery moment another such demon might have been attacking Lord KåñëaHimself. Thus the omniscient and omnipotent Supreme Lord Balarämaexhibited the pastime of becoming slightly nervous in the presence of the horrible demon Pralamba.</div>

<div class="Chapnum">19. Swallowing the Forest Fire</div>
<div class="First">This chapter describes how Lord Kåñëa saved the cows and the cowherd boys from a great fire in the Muïjäraëya forest.</div>
<div class="First">One day the cowherd boys became absorbed in sporting and allowed thecows to wander into a dense forest. Suddenly a forest fire blazed up, and toescape its flames the cows took refuge in a grove of sharp canes. When thecowherd boys missed their animals, they went searching for them, followingtheir hoofprints and the trail of blades of grass and other plants they hadtrampled or had broken with their teeth. Finally the boys found the cows andremoved them from the cane forest, but by that time the forest fire had grownstrong and was threatening both the boys and the cows. Thus the cowherdboys took shelter of Çré Kåñëa, the master of all mystic power, who told them toclose their eyes. They did so, and in a moment He had swallowed up the fierceforest fire and brought them all back to the Bhäëòéra tree mentioned in thelast chapter. Seeing this wonderful display of mystic potency, the cowherd boysthought Kåñëa must be a demigod, and they began to praise Him. Then they all returned home.</div>

In Chapter Twenty, of Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality ofGodhead, Çréla Prabhupäda explains this analogy as follows: "Clouds areaccumulated water drawn from the land by the sunshine. Continually for eightmonths the sun evaporates all kinds of water from the surface of the globe, andthis water is accumulated in the shape of clouds, which are distributed as waterwhen there is need. Similarly, a government exacts various taxes from thecitizens, such as income tax and sales tax, which the citizens are able to pay bytheir different material activities: agriculture, trade, industry and so on. Thistaxation is compared to the sun's drawing water from the earth. When there isagain need of water on the surface of the globe, the same sunshine convertsthe water into clouds and distributes it all over the globe. Similarly, the taxescollected by the government must be distributed to the people again, aseducational work, public work, sanitation work and so on. This is veryessential for a good government. The government should not simply exacttaxes for useless squandering; the tax collection should be utilized for the public welfare of the state."</div>

<div class="First">Just as great, compassionate personalities sometimes give their lives orwealth for the happiness of society, the rain clouds poured down their rainupon the parched earth. Although the clouds were thus dissipated, they freely provided rainfall for the happiness of the earth.</div>
<div class="First">In Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çréla Prabhupäda commentsas follows on this verse: "During the rainy season, there are strong windsblustering all over the country and carrying clouds from one place to anotherto distribute water. When water is urgently needed after the summer season,the clouds are just like a rich man who, in times of need, distributes his moneyeven by exhausting his whole treasury. So the clouds exhaust themselves bydistributing water all over the surface of the globe."Then Mahäräja Daçaratha, the father of Lord Rämacandra, used to fightwith his enemies, it was said that he approached them just like a farmeruprooting unnecessary plants and trees. And when there was need of givingcharity, he used to distribute money exactly as the cloud distributes rain. Thedistribution of rain by clouds is so sumptuous that it is compared to thedistribution of wealth by a great, munificent person. The clouds' downpour isso sufficient that the rains even fall on rocks and hills and on the oceans andseas, where there is no need for water. A cloud is like a charitable person whoopens his treasury for distribution and does not discriminate whether thecharity is needed or not. He gives in charity openhandedly."Metaphorically speaking, the lightning in rain clouds is the light by whichthey see the distressed condition of the earth, and the blowing winds are theirheavy breathing, such as that found in a distressed person. Distressed to seethe condition of the earth, the clouds tremble in the wind like a compassionate person. Thus they pour down their rain.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The earth had been emaciated by the summer heat, but she became fully nourished again when moistened by the god of rain.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çréla Prabhupäda commentson this verse as follows: "Before the rainfall, the whole surface of the globebecomes almost depleted of all kinds of energies and appears very lean. Afterthe rainfall, the whole surface of the earth becomes green with vegetation andappears very healthy and strong. Here, a comparison is made to the personundergoing austerities for fulfillment of a material desire. The flourishingcondition of the earth after a rainy season is compared to the fulfillment ofmaterial desires. Sometimes, when a country is subjugated by an undesirablegovernment, persons and parties undergo severe penances and austerities toget control of the government, and when they attain control they flourish bygiving themselves generous salaries. This also is like the flourishing of theearth in the rainy season. Actually, one should undergo severe austerities andpenances only to achieve spiritual happiness. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it isrecommended that tapasya, or austerities, should be accepted only for realizingthe Supreme Lord. By accepting austerity in devotional service, one regains hisspiritual life, and as soon as one regains his spiritual life, he enjoys unlimitedspiritual bliss. But if someone undertakes austerities and penances for somematerial gain, then, as stated in the Bhagavad-gétä, the results are temporaryand are desired only by persons of less intelligence. "</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Prabhupäda comments as follows: "During the rainy season, in theevening there are many glowworms visible about the tops of trees, hither andthither, and they glitter just like lights. But the luminaries of the sky, the starsand the moon, are not visible. Similarly, in the age of Kali, persons who areatheists or miscreants become very prominently visible, whereas persons whoare actually following the Vedic principles for spiritual emancipation arepractically obscured. This age, Kali-yuga, is compared to the cloudy season ofthe living entities. In this age, real knowledge is covered by the influence ofthe material advancement of civilization. The cheap mental speculators,atheists and manufacturers of so-called religious principles become prominentlike the glowworms, whereas persons strictly following the Vedic principles, orscriptural injunctions, become covered by the clouds of this age."People should learn to take advantage of the actual luminaries of thesky—the sun, moon and stars—instead of the glowworms' light. Actually, theglowworms cannot give any light in the darkness of night. As clouds sometimesclear, even in the rainy season, and the moon, stars and sun become visible, soeven in this Kali-yuga there are sometimes advantages. The Vedic movementof Lord Caitanya—the distribution of the chanting of the Hare Kåñëamantra—is understood in this way. People seriously anxious to find real lifeshould take advantage of this movement instead of looking toward the so-called light of mental speculators and atheists."</div>

Students are generally supposed torise early in the morning. They do not usually arise of their own accord,however, but only when there is a bell sounded in the temple or in the culturalinstitution. By the order of the spiritual master they immediately rise, andafter finishing their morning duties they sit down to study the Vedas or chantVedic mantras. Similarly, everyone is sleeping in the darkness of Kali-yuga, butwhen there is a great äcärya, by his calling only everyone takes to the study of the Vedas to acquire actual knowledge."</div>

The poet Vidyäpati saidthat in the society of friends, family, children, wife and so on, there is certainlysome pleasure, but that pleasure is compared to a drop of water in the desert.Everyone is hankering after happiness, just as in the desert everyone ishankering after water. If in the desert there is a drop of water, the water isthere, of course, but the benefit from that drop of water is very insignificant.In our materialistic way of life, we are hankering after an ocean of happiness,but in the form of society, friends and mundane love we are getting no morethan a drop of water.

<div class="First">It is common for people living in large cities to become miserable anddisgusted when there is ample rainfall. They do not understand or haveforgotten that the rain is nourishing the crops they will eat. Although theycertainly enjoy eating, they do not appreciate that with the rain the SupremeLord is feeding not only human beings but also plants, animals and the earth itself.</div>
<div class="First">Modern, sophisticated people often look down their noses at those engagedin agricultural work. In fact, in American slang, a simple, unintelligent personis sometimes called "a farmer." There are also government agencies that restrictagricultural production because certain capitalists fear the effect on marketprices. Because of various artificial and manipulative practices in moderngovernments, we find widespread food shortages throughout the world—evenin the United States, among the poverty-stricken—and at the same time wefind the governments paying farmers not to plant crops. Sometimes thesegovernments throw huge amounts of food into the ocean. Thus theadministration of the arrogant and ignorant, those who are too proud to obeythe laws of God or too ignorant to recognize them, will always cause frustrationamong the people, whereas a God conscious government will provide abundance and happiness for all.</div>

<div class="Translation"> During the rainy season the moon was prevented from appearing directly by the covering of the clouds, which were themselves illumined by the moon's rays. Similarly, the living being in material existence is prevented from appearing directly by the covering of the false ego, which is itself illumined by the consciousness of the pure soul.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The analogy given here is excellent. During the rainy season we cannot seethe moon in the sky, because the moon is covered by clouds. These clouds,however, are radiant with the glow of the moon's own rays. Similarly, in ourconditioned, material existence we cannot directly perceive the soul, becauseour consciousness is covered by the false ego, which is the false identificationwith the material world and the material body. Yet it is the soul's own consciousness that illumines the false ego.</div>
<div class="First">As the Gétä describes, the energy of the soul is consciousness, and when thisconsciousness manifests through the screen of false ego, it appears as dull,material consciousness, in which there is no direct vision of the soul or God. Inthe material world, even great philosophers ultimately resort to hazyambiguities when speaking about the Absolute Truth, just as the cloudy skymanifests only in a dull and indirect way the iridescent light of the moon.In material life, our false ego is often enthusiastic, hopeful and apparentlyaware of various material affairs, and such consciousness encourages us to pushon in material existence. But in truth we are merely experiencing the dullreflection of our original, pure consciousness, which is Kåñëaconsciousness—direct perception of the soul and God. Not realizing that thefalse ego merely hampers and dulls our real, spiritual consciousness, which isfully enlightened and blissful, we mistakenly think that material consciousnessis full of knowledge and happiness. This is comparable to thinking that theluminous clouds are lighting up the night sky, while in fact it is the moonshinethat illumines the sky, and the clouds that merely dull and hamper themoonshine. The clouds appear luminous because they are filtering andimpeding the brilliant rays of the moon. Similarly, at times materialconsciousness appears pleasurable or enlightened because it is screening orfiltering the original, blissful and enlightened consciousness coming directlyfrom the soul. If we can understand the ingenious analogy given in this verse, we can easily advance in Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Autumn cleared the sky of clouds, let the animals get out of their crowded living conditions, cleaned the earth of its covering of mud, and purified the water of contamination, in the same way that loving service rendered to Lord Kåñëa frees the members of the four spiritual orders from their respective troubles.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Every human being must perform the prescribed duties corresponding toone of the four spiritual orders of life. These divisions are 1) celibate studentlife, brahmacarya; 2) married life, gåhastha; 3) retired life, vänaprastha; and 4)renounced life, sannyäsa. A brahmacäré must perform many menial dutiesduring his student life, but as he becomes advanced in loving service to Kåñëa,his superiors recognize his spiritual status and elevate him to higher duties.The innumerable obligations performed on behalf of wife and childrenconstantly harass a householder, but as he becomes advanced in loving serviceto Kåñëa, he is automatically elevated by the laws of nature to more enjoyable,spiritual occupations, and he somehow minimizes material duties.Those in the vänaprastha, or retired, order of life also perform many duties,and these can also be replaced by ecstatic loving service to Kåñëa. Similarly,renounced life has many natural difficulties, not the least of which is thatsannyäsés, or renounced men, are inclined to meditate on the impersonalaspect of the Absolute Truth. As stated in the Bhagavad-gétä (12.5), kleço'dhikataras teñäm avyaktäsakta-cetasäm: "For those whose minds are attached tothe unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Lord, advancement is exceedinglypainful." But as soon as a sannyäsé takes to preaching the glories of Kåñëa inevery town and village, his life becomes a blissful sequence of beautiful spiritual realizations.</div>
<div class="First">In the autumn season the sky returns to its natural blue color. Thevanishing of the clouds is like the vanishing of troublesome duties inbrahmacäré life. Just after summer comes the rainy season, when the animalssometimes become disturbed by the torrential storms and thus huddle together.But the autumn season signals the time for the animals to go to theirrespective areas and live more peacefully. This represents a householder'sbecoming free from the harassment of family duties and being able to devotemore of his time to spiritual responsibilities, which are the real goal of life bothfor himself and his family. The removal of the muddy layer on the earth is likethe removal of the inconveniences of vänaprastha life, and the purification ofthe water is like the sanctification of sannyäsa life by one's preaching the glories of Kåñëa without sex desire.</div>

The mercantile community, the royal order and the greatsages were free to move to achieve their desired benedictions. Similarly, thetranscendentalists, when freed from the encagement of the material body, alsoachieved their desired goal. During the rainy season, the mercantilecommunity cannot move from one place to another and so do not get theirdesired profit. Nor can the royal order go from one place to another to collecttaxes from the people. As for saintly persons who must travel to preachtranscendental knowledge, they also are restrained by the rainy season. Butduring the autumn, all of them leave their confines. In the case of thetranscendentalist, be he a jïäné, a yogé or a devotee, because of the materialbody he cannot actually enjoy spiritual achievement. But as soon as he gives upthe body, or after death, the jïäné merges into the spiritual effulgence of theSupreme Lord, the yogé transfers himself to the various higher planets, and thedevotee goes to the planet of the Supreme Lord, Goloka Våndävana, or theVaikuëöhas, and thus enjoys his eternal spiritual life."Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A .

<div class="First">This chapter describes how Lord Çré Kåñëa entered the enchanting forest ofVåndävana upon the arrival of autumn, and the praises the young cowherdgirls sang when they heard the vibration of His flute.As Lord Kåñëa, Lord Balaräma and Their cowherd friends entered theforest to graze the cows, Kåñëa began playing His flute. The gopés heard theenchanting flute-song and understood that Kåñëa was entering the forest.Then they narrated to each other the Lord's various activities.The gopés declared, "To see Lord Kåñëa playing His flute while taking thecows to pasture is the highest perfection for the eyes. What pious activities hasthis flute performed that enable him to freely drink the nectar of Çré Kåñëa'slips-a blessing we cowherd girls find difficult to achieve? Hearing the song ofKåñëa's flute, the peacocks dance, and all the other creatures become stunnedwhen they see them. Demigoddesses traveling through the sky in theirairplanes are vexed by Cupid, and their garments become loose. The ears ofthe cows stand on end as they drink the nectar of this flute-song, and theircalves simply stand stunned, the milk they have been drinking from theirmothers' udders still in their mouths. The birds take shelter of the branches ofthe trees and close their eyes, listening to the song of Kåñëa's flute with raptattention. The flowing rivers become perturbed by conjugal attraction forKåñëa and, stopping their flow, embrace Kåñëa's lotus feet with the arms oftheir waves, while the clouds serve as parasols to shade Kåñëa's head from thehot sun. The aborigine women of the Çabara race, seeing the grass stained bythe red kuìkuma adorning the Lord's lotus feet, smear this vermilion powderupon their breasts and faces to alleviate the distress created by Cupid.Govardhana Hill offers grass and various kinds of fruits and bulbous roots inworship of Lord Çré Kåñëa. All the nonmoving living beings take on thecharacteristics of moving creatures, and the moving living beings become stationary. These things are all very wonderful."</div>

Then those peacocks, who are fully satisfiedwith His musical performance, out of gratitude offer for His pleasure their owndivine feathers. In the usual manner of musical performers, Kåñëa gladlyaccepts these presentations and places a feather upon the turban atop Hishead. Gentle animals such as deer and doves greatly relish the transcendentalentertainment presented by Kåñëa, and to get a good view they flock to thepeaks of hills.

<div class="First">This translation is quoted from Çréla Prabhupäda's Caitanya-caritämåta (Madhya 17.36).</div>
<div class="First">According to the äcäryas, the gopés were thinking as follows: "The femaledeer can approach Kåñëa along with their husbands because Kåñëa is theultimate object of affection for the male deer. Because of their affection forKåñëa, they are encouraged by seeing their wives attracted to Him and thusconsider their household lives fortunate. Indeed, they become joyful uponseeing how their wives are searching after Kåñëa, and, following along, theyurge their wives to go to the Lord. On the other hand, our husbands are jealousof Kåñëa, and because of their lack of devotion to Him they cannot even standto smell His fragrance. Therefore what is the use of our lives?"</div>

<div class="Translation"> Kåñëa's beauty and character create a festival for all women. Indeed, when the demigods' wives flying in airplanes with their husbands catch sight of Him and hear His resonant flute-song, their hearts are shaken by Cupid, and they become so bewildered that the flowers fall out of their hair and their belts loosen.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çréla Prabhupäda comments:"[This verse indicates] that the transcendental sound of the flute of Kåñëaextended to all corners of the universe. Also, it is significant that the gopésknew about the different kinds of airplanes flying in the sky."In fact, even while sitting on the laps of their demigod husbands, thedemigoddesses became agitated by hearing the sounds of Kåñëa's flute. Thusthe gopés thought that they themselves should not be blamed for their ecstaticconjugal attraction for Kåñëa, who after all was a cowherd boy from their ownvillage and thus a natural object of their love. If even demigoddesses becamemad after Kåñëa, how could poor, earthly cowherd girls from Kåñëa's ownvillage avoid having their hearts completely conquered by His loving glances and the sounds of His flute?</div>
<div class="First">The gopés also considered that the demigods, although noting their wives'attraction to Kåñëa, did not become envious. The demigods are actually veryrefined in culture and intelligence, and therefore when flying in theirairplanes they regularly take their wives along to see Kåñëa. The gopés thought,"Our husbands, on the other hand, are envious. Therefore even the inferiordeer are better off than we, and the demigoddesses are also very fortunate,whereas we poor human beings in an intermediate position are most unfortunate."</div>

<div class="First">In this regard Çréla Prabhupäda comments, "This is the perfect example ofKåñëa consciousness: to somehow or other remain always engrossed inthoughts of Kåñëa. The vivid example is always present in the behavior of thegopés; therefore Lord Caitanya declared that no one can worship the SupremeLord by any method that is better than the method of the gopés. The gopés werenot born in very high brähmaëa or kñatriya families; they were born in thefamilies of vaiçyas, and not in big mercantile communities but in the familiesof cowherd men. They were not very well educated, although they heard allsorts of knowledge from the brähmaëas, the authorities of Vedic knowledge.The gopés' only purpose was to remain always absorbed in thoughts of Kåñëa."Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A . C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Twenty-first Chapter, ofthe Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Gopés Glorify the Song of Kåñëa's Flute."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">22. Kåñëa Steals the Garments of the Unmarried Gopés</div>
<div class="First">This chapter describes how the marriageable daughters of the cowherd menworshiped Kätyäyané to get Lord Çré Kåñëa as their husband, and how Kåñëastole the garments of the young girls and gave the girls benedictions.During the month of Märgaçérña, every day early in the morning the youngdaughters of the cowherds would take one another's hands and, singing ofKåñëa's transcendental qualities, go to the Yamunä to bathe. Desiring to obtainKåñëa as their husband, they would then worship the goddess Kätyäyané with incense, flowers and other items.</div>
<div class="First">One day, the young gopés left their garments on the shore as usual andbegan playing in the water while chanting of Lord Kåñëa's activities. SuddenlyKåñëa Himself came there, took away all the garments and climbed a nearbykadamba tree. Wanting to tease the gopés, Kåñëa said, "I understand howfatigued you gopés are from your austerities, so please come onto the shore and take back your clothes."</div>
<div class="First">The gopés then pretended to become angry and said the cold water of theYamunä was giving them great pain. If Kåñëa did not give them back theirgarments, they said, they would inform King Kaàsa of all that had happened.But if He did give the clothes back, they would willingly carry out His orders in the mood of humble servants.</div>
<div class="First">Çré Kåñëa replied that He had no fear of King Kaàsa, and that if the girlsreally intended to follow His command and be His maidservants they shouldeach immediately come onto the shore and take their respective garments. Thegirls, trembling from the cold, climbed out of the water with their two handscovering their private parts. Kåñëa, who felt great affection for them, againspoke: "Because while executing a vow you bathed in the water naked, youhave committed an offense against the demigods, and to counteract it youshould offer obeisances with joined palms. Then your vow of austerity will achieve its full result."</div>
<div class="First">The gopés followed this instruction and, folding their hands in respect,offered obeisances to Çré Kåñëa. Satisfied, He gave them back their clothing.But the young girls had become so attracted to Him that they could not leave.Understanding their minds, Kåñëa said that He knew they had worshipedKätyäyané to get Him as their husband. Because they had offered their heartsto Him, their desires would never again become tainted by the mood ofmaterialistic enjoyment, just as fried barleycorns can no longer grow intoshoots. Next autumn, He told them, their most cherished desire would be fulfilled.</div>
<div class="First">Then the gopés, fully satisfied, returned to Vraja, and Çré Kåñëa and Hiscowherd friends went off to a distant place to graze the cows.Sometime later, when the boys felt disturbed by the great heat of summer,they took shelter at the base of a tree that stood just like an umbrella. TheLord then said that the life of a tree is most excellent, for even while feelingpain a tree continues to protect others from heat, rain, snow and so on. Withits leaves, flowers, fruits, shade, roots, bark, wood, fragrance, sap, ashes, pulpand sprouts, a tree fulfills the desires of everyone. This kind of life is ideal.Indeed, said Kåñëa, the perfection of life is to act with one's vital energy,wealth, intelligence and words for the benefit of all.After the Lord had glorified the trees in this way, the entire company wentto the Yamunä, where the cowherd boys let the cows drink the sweet water and also drank some themselves.</div>

<div class="First">According to various äcäryas, the goddess Durgä mentioned in this verse isnot the illusory energy of Kåñëa called Maya but rather the internal potency ofthe Lord known as Yoga-mäyä. The distinction between the internal andexternal, or illusory, potency of the Lord is described in theNärada-païcarätra, in the conversation between Çruti and Vidyä:</div>

<div class="First">"The Lord's inferior potency, known as Durgä, is dedicated to His lovingservice. Being the Lord's potency, this inferior energy is nondifferent fromHim. There is another, superior potency, whose form is on the same spirituallevel as that of God Himself. Simply by scientifically understanding thissupreme potency, one can immediately achieve the Supreme Soul of all souls,who is the Lord of all lords. There is no other process to achieve Him. Thatsupreme potency of the Lord is known as Gokuleçvaré, the goddess of Gokula.Her nature is to be completely absorbed in love of God, and through Her onecan easily obtain the primeval God, the Lord of all that be. This internalpotency of the Lord has a covering potency, known as Mahä-mäyä, who rulesthe material world. In fact she bewilders the entire universe, and thuseveryone within the universe falsely identifies himself with the material body."From the above we can understand that the internal and external, orsuperior and inferior, potencies of the Supreme Lord are personified asYoga-mäyä and Mahä-mäyä, respectively. The name Durgä is sometimes usedto refer to the internal, superior potency, as stated in the Païcarätra: "In allmantras used to worship Kåñëa, the presiding deity is known as Durgä." Thus inthe transcendental sound vibrations glorifying and worshiping the AbsoluteTruth, Kåñëa, the presiding deity of the particular mantra or hymn is calledDurgä. The name Durgä therefore refers also to that personality who functionsas the internal potency of the Lord and who is thus on the platform ofçuddha-sattva, pure transcendental existence. This internal potency isunderstood to be Kåñëa's sister, known also as Ekänaàçä or Subhadrä. This isthe Durgä who was worshiped by the gopés in Våndävana. Several äcäryas havepointed out that ordinary people are sometimes bewildered and think that thenames Mahä-mäyä and Durgä refer exclusively to the external potency of the Lord.</div>
<div class="First">Even if we accept hypothetically that the gopés were worshiping theexternal Mäyä, there is no fault on their part, since in their pastimes of lovingKåñëa they were acting as ordinary members of society. Çréla Prabhupädacomments in this regard: "The Vaiñëavas generally do not worship anydemigods. Çréla Narottama däsa Öhäkura has strictly forbidden all worship ofthe demigods for anyone who wants to advance in pure devotional service. Yetthe gopés, who are beyond compare in their affection for Kåñëa, were seen toworship Durgä. The worshipers of demigods also sometimes mention that thegopés also worshiped goddess Durgä, but we must understand the purpose of thegopés. Generally, people worship goddess Durgä for some material benediction.Here, the gopés could adopt any means to satisfy or serve Kåñëa. That was thesuperexcellent characteristic of the gopés. They worshiped goddess Durgäcompletely for one month in order to have Kåñëa as their husband. Every daythey prayed for Kåñëa, the son of Nanda Mahäräja, to become their husband."The conclusion is that a sincere devotee of Kåñëa will never imagine anymaterial quality to exist in the transcendental gopés, who are the most exalteddevotees of the Lord. The only motivation in all their activities was simply tolove and satisfy Kåñëa, and if we foolishly consider their activities to bemundane in any way, it will be impossible for us to understand Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

Their playing in the water was meant to serve as theavabhåtha-snäna, the ceremonial bath taken immediately upon the completion of a Vedic sacrifice.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Prabhupäda comments as follows: "It is an old system among Indiangirls and women that when they take bath in the river they place theirgarments on the bank and dip into the water completely naked. The portion ofthe river where the girls and women take bath was strictly prohibited to anymale, and this is still the system. The Supreme Personality of Godhead,knowing the minds of the unmarried young gopés, awarded them their desiredobjective. They had prayed for Kåñëa to become their husband, and Kåñëa wanted to fulfill their desires."</div>

YetLord Kåñëa made them come out of the water and bow down to Him. Althoughthe bodily forms of the gopés were all fully developed, and although Kåñëa metthem in a secluded place and brought them fully under His control, becausethe Lord is completely transcendental there was not a trace of material desirein His mind.

<div class="First">Kåñëa wanted to see the full surrender of the gopés, and thus He orderedthem to offer obeisances with their palms joined above their heads. In otherwords, the gopés could no longer cover their bodies. We should not foolishlythink that Lord Kåñëa is an ordinary lusty boy enjoying the naked beauty ofthe gopés. Kåñëa is the Supreme Absolute Truth, and He was acting to fulfillthe loving desire of the young cowherd girls of Våndävana. In this world wewould certainly become lusty in a situation like this. But to compare ourselvesto God is a great offense, and because of this offense we will not be able tounderstand Kåñëa's transcendental position, for we will wrongly take Him tobe materially conditioned like ourselves. To lose transcendental sight of Kåñëais certainly a great disaster for one trying to relish the bliss of the Absolute Truth.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Thus the young girls of Våndävana, considering what Lord Acyuta had told them, accepted that they had suffered a falldown from their vow by bathing naked in the river. But they still desired to successfully complete their vow, and since Lord Kåñëa is Himself the ultimate result of all pious activities, they offered their obeisances to Him to cleanse away all their sins.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The transcendental position of Kåñëa consciousness is clearly describedhere. The gopés decided that it was better to renounce their so-called familytradition and traditional morality and simply surrender unto the SupremeLord Kåñëa. This does not mean that the Kåñëa consciousness movementadvocates immoral activities. In fact, the devotees of ISKCON practice thehighest standard of restraint and morality, but at the same time we recognizethe transcendental position of Kåñëa. Lord Kåñëa is God and therefore has nomaterial desire to enjoy young girls in sexual affairs. As will be seen in thischapter, Lord Kåñëa was not at all attracted to enjoying the gopés; rather Hewas attracted to their love and wanted to satisfy them.The greatest offense is to imitate the activities of Lord Kåñëa. In India thereis a group called präkåta-sahajiyä, who imitate these affairs of Kåñëa and try toenjoy naked young girls in the name of worshiping Kåñëa. The ISKCONmovement sternly rejects this mockery of religion, because the greatest offenseis for a human being to ludicrously imitate the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. In the ISKCON movement there are no cheap incarnations, and itis not possible for a devotee of this movement to promote himself to the position of Kåñëa.</div>
<div class="First">Five hundred years ago Kåñëa appeared as Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu, whopracticed strict celibacy throughout His student life and at the age oftwenty-four took sannyäsa, a lifelong vow of celibacy. Caitanya Mahäprabhurigidly avoided contact with women in order to carry out His vow of lovingservice to Kåñëa. When Kåñëa personally appeared five thousand years ago, Heexhibited these wonderful pastimes, which attract our attention. We shouldnot become envious or shocked when we hear that God can perform suchpastimes. Our shock is due to our ignorance, because if we tried to performthese activities our bodies would be afflicted by lust. Lord Kåñëa, however, isthe Supreme Absolute Truth and is therefore never disturbed by any materialdesire whatsoever. Thus, this incident—in which the gopés gave up normalstandards of morality and, raising their hands to their head, bowed down incompliance with Kåñëa's order—is an example of pure devotional surrender and not a discrepancy in religious principles.</div>
<div class="First">In fact, the gopés' surrender is the perfection of all religion, as ÇrélaPrabhupäda describes in Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead: "The gopéswere all simple souls, and whatever Kåñëa said, they took to be true. In order tobe freed from the wrath of Varuëadeva, as well as to fulfill the desired end oftheir vows and ultimately to please their worshipable Lord, Kåñëa, theyimmediately abided by His order. Thus they became the greatest lovers of Kåñëa, and His most obedient servitors.</div>
<div class="First">"Nothing can compare to the Kåñëa consciousness of the gopés. Actually thegopés did not care for Varuëa or any other demigod; they only wanted to satisfy Kåñëa."</div>

The gopés interpreted the whole incident asproof that Kåñëa was also attached to them. Otherwise, why would He havegone to the trouble of playing with them in this way? Because they thoughtthat Kåñëa was now attached to them, they glanced at Him with shyness, andbeing stunned by the rising of their ecstatic love, they could not move fromwhere they stood. Kåñëa had overcome their shyness and forced them to comeout of the water naked, but now, having dressed properly, they again becameshy in His presence. In fact, this incident increased their humbleness beforeKåñëa. They did not want Kåñëa to see them staring at Him, but theycautiously took the opportunity to glance at the Lord.</div>

Because of their intense love, the gopés did not see Kåñëa asGod but rather as the most wonderful boy in all creation, and being beautifulyoung girls, they desired only to please Him by loving service. Lord Kåñëaunderstood the pure desire of the gopés and was thus satisfied.

<div class="Translation"> Then, O King, the cowherd boys began herding the animals in a leisurely way within a small forest along the Yamunä. But soon they became afflicted by hunger and, approaching Kåñëa and Balaräma, spoke as follows.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Jéva Gosvämé explains that the cowherd boys were concerned thatKåñëa would be hungry, and thus they feigned their own hunger so that Kåñëaand Balaräma would make suitable arrangements to eat.Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A . C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Twenty-second Chapter,of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Kåñëa Steals the Garments of the Unmarried Gopés."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">23. The Brähmaëas' Wives Blessed</div>
<div class="First">This chapter describes how Lord Çré Kåñëa, after inducing the cowherd boysto beg for food, showed mercy to the wives of some brähmaëas performing asacrifice and made the brähmaëas themselves feel remorse.When the cowherd boys became very hungry, they asked Çré Kåñëa aboutobtaining food, and He sent them to beg some from a group of brähmaëas whowere performing a sacrifice nearby. But these brähmaëas ignored the boys,thinking Çré Kåñëa an ordinary human being. The boys returned disappointed,but the Lord sent them off again, advising them to ask the brähmaëas' wivesfor the food. These ladies had heard of Kåñëa's transcendental qualities andwere very much attached to Him. Thus as soon as they learned He was nearby,they went to Him in great haste, bringing all four varieties of food. In this way they offered themselves to Çré Kåñëa.</div>
<div class="First">Kåñëa told the women that while one can develop transcendental love forHim by seeing His Deity form in the temple, meditating upon Him andchanting His glories, one cannot achieve this result simply by being in Hisphysical presence. He advised them that since they were housewives, theirparticular duty was to help their husbands perform sacrifices. He therefore instructed them to return to their homes.</div>
<div class="First">When the ladies went back home, their brähmaëa husbands at once feltremorse, and they lamented, "For anyone inimical to Kåñëa, his threebirths-seminal, brahminical and sacrificial-are all condemned. On the otherhand, these womenfolk, who have not undergone the purificatory processes ofthe brahminical class or performed any austerity or pious rituals, have throughdevotion for Kåñëa easily cut off the bondage of death."Since Lord Kåñëa's every desire is completely fulfilled, His begging for foodwas simply an act of mercy toward us brähmaëas. All the fruits of Vedicsacrifice-and indeed all things on earth-are His opulences, yet out of ignorance we could not appreciate this fact."</div>
<div class="First">Having spoken thus, all the brähmaëas offered their obeisances to Lord ÇréKåñëa, hoping to counteract their offense. Nonetheless, out of fear of King Kaàsa they did not go to see the Lord in person.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The term bhümi-deväù, "gods on earth," refers here to the brähmaëas, whoare supposed to closely represent the will of the Supreme Lord. The philosophyof Kåñëa consciousness is not a primitive polytheistic doctrine holding thathuman beings on the earth are gods. Rather, it is a science that traces thedescent of authority from the Absolute Truth Himself, Çré Kåñëa. Theauthority and power of God naturally extend along with the extension of Hiscreation, and on the earth the Lord's will and authority are represented by purified, enlightened men called brähmaëas.</div>
<div class="First">This account will illustrate that the ritualistic brähmaëas approached by thecowherd boys were not at all properly enlightened and thus could notappreciate the position of Kåñëa and Balaräma or that of Their intimateassociates. In fact, this pastime exposes the pretentious position of so-calledbrähmaëas who are not faithful devotees of the Supreme Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The cowherd boys doubted the generosity of the brähmaëas, and thus theyused the word bubhukñitau, meaning that Kåñëa and Balaräma were hungry.The boys expected the brähmaëas to know the Vedic injunction annasyakñuditaà pätram: "Anyone who is hungry is a fit candidate for receiving foodin charity." But if the brähmaëas would not recognize the authority of Kåñëaand Balaräma, their title dvija would be taken to mean merely "born from twoparents" (dvi-from two, ja-born) rather than "twice-born." When thebrähmaëas did not respond to the cowherd boys' initial request, the boysaddressed the brähmaëas, with a slight trace of sarcasm, as dharma-vit-tamäù, "O best of the knowers of religion."</div>

<div class="First">The cowherd boys anticipated the possible objection from the brähmaëasthat they couldn't give the boys any food because they themselves had not yeteaten, and that a priest initiated to perform a sacrifice should not eat.Therefore the boys humbly informed the brähmaëas about varioustechnicalities of ritualistic sacrifice. The cowherd boys were not unaware ofthe formalities of Vedic culture, but their real intention was simply to render loving service to Lord Kåñëa.</div>

Lord Kåñëa is ätma-priya, the real object of love foreveryone. Although each individual has his own taste and freedom, ultimatelyevery living being is a spiritual spark of the Supreme Personality of Godhead;thus everyone's primary loving attraction is constitutionally meant for Lord ÇréKåñëa. Loving service to the Lord should be ahaituké, without personal motive,and avyavahitä, unobstructed by mental speculation, selfish desire or any quirk of time and circumstance.</div>

<div class="First">The word yat-samparkät in this verse refers to contact with the individualself and ultimately with the Supreme Self, the Lord, who is the origin of theindividual living being. By developing Kåñëa consciousness, one automaticallybecomes self-realized, and thus one's vital strength, intelligence, mind,relatives, body, family and wealth all become enhanced and brilliant by thecentral influence of Kåñëa consciousness. This happens because Kåñëaconsciousness is the optimum efficient conjunction of the individual self, whois pure consciousness, with the Supreme Self and supreme consciousness, Kåñëa.</div>

Now that we have attained Your lotus feet, we simply wish to remain here in the forest so we may carry upon our heads the garlands of tulasé leaves You may neglectfully kick away with Your lotus feet. We are ready to give up all material relationships.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Here the brähmaëas' wives are saying something similar to what the gopéssay at the beginning of the räsa dance (SB 10.29.31), when Lord Kåñëa tellsthem to go home as well. Like this verse, the gopés' statement begins with the words maivaà vibho 'rhati bhavän gadituà nå-çaàsam.</div>
<div class="First">Nigama refers to the Vedic literature, which states that one who surrendersat the lotus feet of the Lord does not return to this material world. Thus thebrähmaëas' wives appealed to the Lord that since they had surrendered to Him,it was unfair for Him to order them to return to their materialistic husbands.According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, Lord Kåñëa might havepointed out to the brähmaëas' wives, "You young ladies are members of thearistocratic brähmaëa community, so how can you surrender at the feet of a mere cowherd boy?"</div>
<div class="First">To this the ladies might have replied, "Since we have already surrendered atYour lotus feet, and since we desire to become Your servants, we are obviouslynot maintaining a false identification as members of the so-called brähmaëacommunity. You can easily ascertain this from our words."Lord Kåñëa might have replied, "I am a cowherd boy, and My propermaidservants and girlfriends are the cowherd girls, the gopés. "The wives might have answered, "True, let them be so. Let them shine forthif You are embarrassed in front of Your relatives to make brähmaëa ladies Yourmaidservants. We certainly don't want to embarrass You. We will not go toYour village but will rather remain in Våndävana, like presiding deities of theforest. We simply desire to perfect our lives by even a slight trace of connection with You."</div>
<div class="First">Thus by the spiritual insight of Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, welearn that the brähmaëas' wives offered to remain at a distance and simply takethe tulasé leaves that would fall from the lotus feet of Kåñëa or be crushed bythe feet of His girlfriends when He would embrace them.The ladies offered to carry these tulasé leaves upon their heads. Thusrenouncing the desire to become Kåñëa's intimate girlfriends or maidservants(a position they knew was difficult to achieve), the young brähmaëa ladiesbegged to remain in Våndävana forest. If the Lord had then asked "Then whatwill your family members say?" they would have replied "We have alreadytranscended our so-called relatives because we are seeing You, the Supreme Lord, face to face."</div>

<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura comments as follows: "From their veryyouth the brähmaëas' wives had heard about Lord Kåñëa's beauty, qualities andsweetness from the womenfolk of Våndävana village, and also from the flowerladies, the betel-nut sellers and others. Consequently they always felt ecstaticlove for Kåñëa and were indifferent to their household duties. Their husbands,seeing them as deviant, doubted them and avoided dealing with them as far aspossible. Now the wives of the brähmaëas were ready to formally reject theirso-called families and neighbors, and out of great agitation they were cryingand placing their heads upon Lord Kåñëa's lotus feet, offering obeisances. Inthis way, with choking voices, they spoke the above verse. They begged thatLord Kåñëa bestow upon them the benediction that He be their onlydestination, that He, the chastiser of enemies, subdue all their enemies—thosedifficulties obstructing them from attaining the Lord."The wives of the brähmaëas simply wanted to serve Lord Kåñëa, and this ispure Kåñëa consciousness in ecstatic love of Godhead.</div>

But thebrähmaëas were not on such an advanced platform of Kåñëa consciousness andthus, overcome by fear of Kaàsa, could not see the Lord face to face.Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A . C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Twenty-third Chapter, ofthe Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Brähmaëas' Wives Blessed."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">24. Worshiping Govardhana Hill</div>
<div class="First">In this chapter Lord Çré Kåñëa crushes the pride of Indra by prohibiting asacrifice intended for him and initiating a substitute sacrifice in worship of Govardhana Hill.</div>
<div class="First">When Çré Kåñëa saw the cowherd men busily preparing for a sacrifice toIndra, He inquired about it from their king, Nanda. Nanda explained that therain given by Indra enables all living entities to maintain their lives, andtherefore this sacrifice would be executed to satisfy him. Kåñëa responded, "Itis because of karma alone that living entities take their birth in a certain body,experience varieties of happiness and suffering in that body, and then give itup as the karma pertaining to it runs out. Thus it is karma alone that is ourenemy, our friend, our guru and our lord, and Indra can do nothing to alter thehappiness and distress of anyone, for everyone is tightly bound by his karmicreactions. The material modes of goodness, passion and ignorance bring aboutthe creation, maintenance and destruction of this world. The clouds give forthrain when they are impelled by the mode of passion, and cowherds prosper byprotecting the cows. Furthermore, the cowherds' proper residence is in theforest and on the hills. Therefore you should offer worship to the cows, the brähmaëas and Govardhana Hill."</div>
<div class="First">After Kåñëa spoke thus, He arranged for the cowherd men to worshipGovardhana with the paraphernalia collected for the sacrifice to Indra. Hethen assumed a huge, unprecedented transcendental form and devoured all thefood and other offerings presented to Govardhana. As He did so Heproclaimed to the cowherd community that although they had worshipedIndra for so long, he had never appeared in person, whereas Govardhanahimself had now manifested before their eyes and eaten their offerings offoodstuffs. Therefore they should all now offer obeisances to Govardhana Hill.Then Lord Kåñëa joined the cowherds in offering obeisances to His own newly assumed form.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa minimized the importance of the demigods by speaking thephilosophy known as Karma-väda or Karma-mémäàsä, which, basically, isatheism with a belief in reincarnation. According to this philosophy, there aresubtle laws of nature that reward or punish us according to how we act: "Asyou sow, so shall you reap." In a future life one reaps the fruit of his presentwork, and this is the sum and substance of reality. Lord Kåñëa, being GodHimself, could hardly be a serious proponent of this mediocre philosophy.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Here Lord Kåñëa argues that if there is a supreme controller, He mustdepend on a performer of activity to reciprocate with and must therefore alsobe subject to the laws of karma, being obliged to award happiness and distressto conditioned souls according to the laws of good and evil.This superficial argument neglects the obvious point that the laws of naturethat prescribe the good and bad results of pious and impious acts arethemselves creations of the all-good Supreme Lord. Being the creator andsustainer of these laws, the Lord is not subject to them. Furthermore, the Lordis not dependent on the work of the conditioned souls, since He is satisfiedand complete within Himself. Out of His all-merciful nature He awards theresults appropriate to our activities. That which we call destiny, fate or karmais an elaborate and subtle system of rewards and punishments meant forgradually encouraging conditioned souls to evolve to the stage of perfectconsciousness, which is their original, constitutional nature.The Supreme Personality of Godhead has so dexterously formulated andapplied the laws of material nature governing punishment and reward forhuman behavior that the living being is discouraged from sin and encouragedtoward goodness without suffering any significant interference with his free will as an eternal soul.</div>
<div class="First">In contrast to the material nature, the Lord exhibits His essential nature inthe spiritual world, where He reciprocates the eternal love of His puredevotees. Such loving affairs are based completely on the mutual freedom ofthe Lord and His devotees, not on a mechanical reciprocation of coincidingselfish interests. The Supreme Lord, assisted by His pure devotees, repeatedlyoffers the conditioned souls of this world the opportunity to give up theirbizarre attempt at exploiting the material universe and go back home, back toGodhead, for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge. Considering all thesepoints, the atheistic arguments given here by Lord Kåñëa in a playful mood are not to be taken seriously.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa's argument here is not a negation of free will. If one accepts theexistence of karma as a system of laws awarding reactions for our presentactivities, then we ourselves, according to our nature, will decide our future.Our happiness and distress in this life have already been adjudicated and fixedaccording to our previous activities, and not even the demigods can changethat. They must award us the prosperity or poverty, sickness or health,happiness or distress due us by our previous work. However, we still retain thefreedom to select a pious or impious mode of activity in this life, and thechoice we make will determine our future suffering and enjoyment.For example, if I was pious in my last life, in this life the demigods mayaward me great material wealth. But I am free to spend my riches for good orfor bad purposes, and my choice will determine my future life. Thus, althoughno one can change the karmic results due him in this life, everyone still retainshis free will, by which he determines what his future situation will be. LordKåñëa's argument here is quite interesting; however, it neglects the overridingconsideration that we are all eternal servants of God and must satisfy Him by all that we do.</div>

<div class="First">Even the demigods are bound and limited by the laws of karma. That Indrahimself is subordinate to the laws of karma is explicitly stated in theBrahma-saàhitä (5.54): yas tv indra-gopam atha vendram ahosva-karma-bandhänurüpa-phala-bhäjanam ätanoti. The Supreme Lord,Govinda, awards all creatures the appropriate results of their work. This is astrue for mighty Indra, the lord of the material heavens, as it is for the germcalled indra-gopa. The Bhagavad-gétä (7.20) also states, kämais tais tairhåta-jïänäù prapadyante 'nya-devatäù. Only those who have lost theirintelligence because of various material desires surrender unto demigods ratherthan worship the Supreme Lord. In fact, the demigods cannot award benefitsto anyone independently, as stated by Lord Kåñëa in the Gétä: mayaiva vihitänhi tän. All benefits are ultimately issued by the Lord Himself.Thus it is not altogether incorrect to say that demigod worship is useless,since even the demigods are under the laws of karma. In fact, this is the case.But Lord Kåñëa, the Supreme Absolute Truth, is not subordinate to the law ofkarma; rather, He can independently offer or withhold His favor. This isconfirmed in the verse from the Brahma-saàhitä quoted above, the third lineof which is karmäëi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhäjäm: [Bs. 5.54] "The SupremeLord burns up all the accumulated karma of those engaged in His lovingservice." Not only is Lord Kåñëa above the laws of material action andreaction, but He can immediately dissolve these laws for anyone who satisfiesHim through loving service. Thus the almighty God is supreme in absolutefreedom, and by surrendering to Him we can escape the bonds of karma and stop accepting their dismal rule as supreme.</div>

<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa here proposes the modern if absurd philosophy that our work oroccupation is really God and that we should therefore simply worship ourwork. Upon close scrutiny, we observe that our work is nothing more than theinteraction of the material body with material nature, as Lord Kåñëa Himselfstates~ in a more serious mood, in the Bhagavad-gétä (3.28): guëä guëeñuvartanta. Karma-mémäàsä philosophy accepts that good activity in this life willgive us a better next life. If this is true, there must be some type of conscioussoul different from the body. And if that is the case, why should atranscendental soul worship the interaction of the temporary body withmaterial nature? If the words sampüjayet karma here mean that one shouldworship the laws of karma governing our activities, then one may astutely askwhat it means to worship laws and, indeed, what might be the origin of suchlaws and who is maintaining them. To say that laws have created or aremaintaining the world is a meaningless proposition, since there is nothingabout the nature of a law that indicates it could generate the existentialsituation it is supposed to govern. In fact, worship is meant for Kåñëa Himself,and this real conclusion will be clearly revealed in this chapter.</div>

According to Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, theaudacity that child Kåñëa displayed before His father and other elders shouldbe understood as an exhibition of transcendental anger aroused when He sawHis eternal devotees worshiping an insignificant demigod.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The members of the cowherd community, having thus been inspired by Lord Väsudeva to properly execute the sacrifice to Govardhana Hill, the cows and the brähmaëas, returned with Lord Kåñëa to their village, Vraja.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Although the Govardhana-püjä was performed in a blissful and successfulway, the matter was hardly finished. Lord Indra is, after all, tremendouslypowerful, and he received the news of the Govardhana sacrifice with burninganger. What ensued will be described in the following chapter.Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Twenty-fourth Chapter,of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Worshiping Govardhana Hill."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">25. Lord Kåñëa Lifts Govardhana Hill</div>
<div class="First">This chapter describes how Lord Indra was overcome by anger when theresidents of Vraja canceled his sacrifice, how he tried to punish them bysending forth a devastating rainfall to Våndävana, and how Lord Çré Kåñëaprotected Gokula by lifting Govardhana Hill and for seven days using it as an umbrella to ward off the rain.</div>
<div class="First">Indra, angered at the disruption of the sacrifice meant for him and falselypresuming himself the supreme controller, said, "People often give up thepursuit of transcendental knowledge-the means for self-realization-andimagine that they can cross over the ocean of material existence by mundanefruitive sacrifices. Similarly, these cowherd men have become intoxicated bypride and have offended me by taking shelter of an ignorant, ordinary child-Kåñëa."</div>
<div class="First">To remove this supposed pride of the residents of Vraja, Indra sent theclouds known as Säàvartaka, whose function is to facilitate the destruction ofthe world. He sent them to harass the Vrajaväsés with downpours of rain andhail. The cowherd community was very disturbed by this and approachedKåñëa for shelter. Understanding that this trouble was the work of Indra,Kåñëa decided to smash to pieces Indra's false prestige, and thus He liftedGovardhana Hill with one hand. He then invited the entire cowherdcommunity to take shelter in the dry space beneath the mountain. For sevensuccessive days He held up the hill, until Indra finally understood Kåñëa's mystic power and ordered the clouds to withdraw.</div>
<div class="First">When the cowherd villagers emerged from beneath the mountain, Kåñëaput Govardhana Hill back in its proper place. The cowherds were in ecstasy,showing loving symptoms such as flowing tears and bodily hairs standing onend. They embraced Kåñëa and offered Him benedictions according to theirrespective positions, while the demigods in heaven rained down flowers and sang the Lord's praises.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">At the very beginning of this chapter Çukadeva Gosvämé reveals thefoolishness of Indra and the absurdity of his anger. Indra was frustratedbecause the residents of Våndävana accepted Çré Kåñëa as their Lord. But thesimple fact is that Çré Kåñëa is the Lord, not only of the residents ofVåndävana but of all that exists, including Indra himself. Thus Indra's petulantreaction was ridiculous. As the common saying goes, "Pride goes before a fall."</div>

<div class="First">The word éça-mäné here is very significant. Indra arrogantly consideredhimself to be the Lord, and thus he exhibited the typical attitude of aconditioned soul. Many thinkers in the twentieth century have noted theexaggerated sense of individual prestige characteristic of our culture; indeed,writers have even coined the phrase "the me generation." Everyone in thisworld is more or less guilty of the syndrome called éça-mäna, or proudly considering oneself the Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Çrédhara Svämé, through the insults of Indra GoddessSarasvaté is actually praising Kåñëa. The äcärya explains: "Väcälam means 'onewho can speak according to Vedic authority.' Bäliçam means 'free frompretension, just like a child.' Stabdham means that He bows down to no onebecause there is no one for Him to offer homage to, ajïam means that there isnothing more for Him to know because He is omniscient, paëòita-mäninammeans that He is highly honored by the knowers of the Absolute Truth, andkåñëam means He is the Supreme Absolute Truth, whose transcendental formis full of eternity and ecstasy. Martyam means that although He is theAbsolute Truth, He nevertheless appears in this world as a human being out of affection for His devotees."</div>
<div class="First">Indra wanted to rebuke Kåñëa as väcälam because the Lord had presentedmany audacious arguments in the line of Karma-mémäàsä and Säìkhyaphilosophy even though He did not accept these arguments; thus Indra calledthe Lord bäliça, "foolish." Indra called Him stabdha because He had spokenboldly even in the presence of His own father. Thus although Indra attemptedto criticize Çré Kåñëa, the Lord's transcendental character is in fact impeccable,and this chapter will demonstrate how Indra came to recognize the position of the Lord.</div>

<div class="First">It is clear from this verse that the residents of Våndävana had becomehighly prosperous simply by protecting cows, since Indra wanted to destroytheir so-called pride based on wealth by killing their animals. Well-tendedcows produce large quantities of milk, from which come cheese, butter, yogurt,ghee and so on. These foods are delicious by themselves and also enhanceother foods, such as fruits, vegetables and grains. Bread and vegetables aredelicious with butter, and fruit is especially appetizing when mixed with creamor yogurt. Dairy products are always desirable in civilized society, and thesurplus can be traded for many valuable commodities. Thus, simply by a Vedicdairy enterprise, the residents of Våndävana were wealthy, healthy and happy,even in the material sense, and most of all they were eternal associates of the Supreme Lord Kåñëa.</div>

<div class="First">The demigods are supposed to be sad-bhäva-yukta, endowed with spiritualexistence, since they are deputed servants of the Supreme Lord. In the Bhagavad-gétä (4.24) it is stated:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">brahmärpaëaà brahma havir</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">brahmägnau brahmaëä hutam</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">brahmaiva tena gantavyaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">brahma-karma-samädhinä</div>
<div class="First">"That which is duly offered to the Lord becomes spiritualized." The demigodsengage in the devotional service of the Lord by managing various departmentsof cosmic administration. Therefore as demigods, or as servants of the Lord,their existence is pure (sad-bhäva). When the demigods fail to live up to thehigh position given them by the Lord and deviate from proper behavior, theyare not acting as demigods but rather as conditioned souls.Mäna, or false prestige, is certainly an anxiety-ridden burden for theconditioned soul. A falsely proud person is not truly peaceful or satisfied,because his understanding of himself is false and inflated. When a servant ofthe Lord becomes asat, or irreligious, the Lord saves him from impiety bybreaking the false prestige that has led him to be offensive or sinful. As statedby the Lord Himself, yasyäham anugåhëämi hariñye tad-dhanaà çanaiù: [SB10.88.8] "I give My blessings to a person by taking away his so-called opulence."Of course, the advanced stage of devotional service to the Lord, asdescribed by Rüpa Gosvämé, is yukta-vairägya, utilizing the opulence of thisworld to execute the Lord's mission. Obviously the things of this world can beused wonderfully to spread the glories of God and to create a godly society, anda more advanced devotee will not be seduced by material paraphernalia butwill dutifully and honestly engage it solely for the pleasure of the Lord. In thisparticular case, Lord Indra forgot that he was a humble servant of God, andLord Kåñëa therefore arranged to bring this bewildered demigod to his senses.</div>

<div class="First">The word mac-charaëam indicates not only that Lord Kåñëa was the soleshelter for the vraja-jana, the people of Våndävana, but also that Lord Kåñëahad established His home among them. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkuraquotes from the Anekärtha-varga dictionary, çaraëaà gåha-rakñitroù: "Theword çaraëam can represent either home or protector." The residents ofVåndävana adopted Kåñëa as their beloved child, friend, lover and life itself,and the Lord reciprocated their feelings. Thus Çré Kåñëa lived among thesefortunate people, moving in their houses and fields; naturally He would protect such intimate devotees from all types of danger.</div>

However, because the hill was inecstasy, being touched by the hand of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, itacquired inconceivable power and even felt the hundreds of deadlythunderbolts thrown upon its back by angry Indra to be offerings of soft,fragrant flowers. At times Çré Govardhana was not even aware that thethunderbolts were striking. From the Hari-vaàça the äcärya has also quotedÇré Kåñëa Himself as saying, trai-lokyam apy utsahate rakñituà kià punarvrajam: "Çré Govardhana can give shelter to all the three worlds, what to speak of the simple land of Vraja."</div>

<div class="First">In this chapter Nanda Mahäräja describes Kåñëa's opulences to the cowherd men, as Nanda had heard of them from Garga Muni.</div>
<div class="First">The cowherd men, unaware of Lord Kåñëa's power, were amazed to see Hisvarious extraordinary activities. The men approached Nanda Mahäräja andtold him that after seeing how Kåñëa, a boy only seven years old, had lifted amountain, and how He had previously killed the demoness Pütanä andgenerated extreme attraction in the hearts of everyone in Våndävana, the menhad become doubtful and bewildered about how Çré Kåñëa could possibly havetaken birth in the unsuitable environment of a cowherd community. Nandareplied by relating to them what Garga Muni had told him about Çré Kåñëa.Garga Muni had said that in the previous three ages Nanda's boy hadmanifested Himself in white, red and yellow forms, whereas now, in theDväpara age, He had assumed His darkish-blue form, kåñëa-rüpa. Because Hedescended as the son of Vasudeva, one of His many names is Väsudeva, and Hehas innumerable other names indicating His many qualities and activities.Garga Muni had predicted that Kåñëa would prevent all sorts ofcatastrophes in Gokula, spread unlimited auspiciousness, and increase theecstasy of the cowherd men and women. In a previous age He had providedprotection for the saintly brähmaëas when they were harassed by low-classdacoits and there was no proper ruler in society. As the demons in the higherplanets can never defeat the demigods who have Lord Viñëu on their side, noenemy can ever defeat those who love Kåñëa. In His affinity for His devoteesand in His opulence and power, Kåñëa is just like Lord Näräyaëa Himself.Overjoyed and awestruck by Garga Muni's statements, the cowherd menconcluded that Kåñëa must be an empowered representative of the SupremeLord, Näräyaëa. Thus they worshiped Him and Nanda Mahäräja.</div>

Butafterwards, when they had returned to their homes, perplexity arose withintheir hearts. Thus they thought, 'Now we have directly seen child Kåñëa liftGovardhana Hill, and we remember how He killed Pütanä and other demons,extinguished the forest fire, and so on. At the time, we thought that theseextraordinary acts occurred because of a benediction from the brähmaëas orbecause of Nanda Mahäräja's great fortune, or that perhaps this boy hadachieved the mercy of Lord Näräyaëa and was thus empowered by Him." 'But all these presumptions are false, because an ordinary seven-year oldboy could never hold up the king of mountains for seven whole days. Kåñëa isnot a human being. He must be the Supreme Lord Himself." 'But on the other hand, child Kåñëa loves it when we coddle Him, and Hebecomes morose when we—His uncles and well-wishers, simply worldlycowherd men—do not give Him attention. He appears to become hungry andthirsty, steals yogurt and milk, sometimes plays tricks, tells lies, chatterschildishly and tends the calves.

<div class="Translation"> Dear Nanda, how is it that we and all the other residents of Vraja cannot give up our constant affection for your son? And how is it that He is so spontaneously attracted to us?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The very word kåñëa means "the all-attractive one." The residents ofVåndävana could not give up their constant love (anuräga) for Lord Kåñëa.Their attitude toward Him was not particularly theistic, because they wereunsure whether He was God or not. But He attracted all their love preciselybecause as God He is the all-attractive person, the supreme object of our love.The cowherd men also asked, "How is it that young Kåñëa feels suchconstant love for us?" In fact the Supreme Lord loves all living beings, who areeternally His children. At the end of the Bhagavad-gétä, Lord Kåñëadramatically declares His affection for Arjuna and urges Arjuna to reciprocatethat love by surrendering to Him. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, in His prayers toLord Kåñëa, states, etädåçé tava kåpä bhagavan mamäpi durdaivam édåçam ihäjaninänurägaù: "My Lord, You are so merciful toward Me, but I am so unfortunatethat love for You has not awakened within Me." (Çikñäñöaka 2) In thisstatement Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu also uses the word anuräga. Ourmisfortune is that we cannot reciprocate the anuräga, or loving affection, thatthe Lord feels for us. Although we are infinitesimal and insignificant and theLord is infinitely attractive, somehow we do not give Him our love. We mustaccept responsibility for this foolish decision, since to surrender to God or not is the essential expression of our free will.</div>
<div class="First">The Kåñëa consciousness movement provides an efficient, systematicprogram to help conditioned souls revive their original, blissful consciousness,which is love of God, Kåñëa consciousness. The intricacies of Kåñëaconsciousness are so wonderful that even Kåñëa's eternal associates, theresidents of Våndävana, are astonished by them, as shown by these verses.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Indra became angry when his sacrifice was disrupted, and thus he caused rain and hail to fall on Gokula, accompanied by lightning and powerful winds, all of which brought great suffering to the cowherds, animals and women there. When Lord Kåñëa, who is by nature always compassionate, saw the condition of those who had only Him as their shelter, He smiled broadly and lifted Govardhana Hill with one hand, just as a small child picks up a mushroom to play with it. Holding up the hill, He protected the cowherd community. May He, Govinda, the Lord of the cows and the destroyer of Indra's false pride, be pleased with us.</div>

<div class="First">It is apparent from this and the previous verses in this chapter that LordKåñëa's lifting of Govardhana Hill made quite an impression on the simplecowherd men of Våndävana, and they repeatedly remembered this feat.Certainly anyone who soberly and objectively considers the activities of youngKåñëa will surrender to Him and become His eternal devotee in lovingdevotional service.

<div class="First">This chapter describes how the Surabhi cow and Indra, having seen theamazing power of Lord Kåñëa, performed a bathing ceremony for Him.Ashamed of having attacked Våndävana with a violent storm, Indrasecretly came before Lord Kåñëa, offered obeisances and praised Him. Indrastated that although Çré Kåñëa is never caught in the current of materialillusion, which is born of ignorance, He nevertheless accepts a humanlike bodyand performs various activities to establish religious principles and chastise thewicked. By this means He crushes the false prestige of those who presumethemselves great controllers. Indra went on to declare that Kåñëa is the father,guru and Lord of all living entities, and that in the form of time He is the agent of their punishment.</div>
<div class="First">Satisfied with Indra's prayers, Çré Kåñëa told him that He had stopped theindra-yajïa so that Indra, puffed up as he was with false pride, would rememberthe Lord. Persons intoxicated by material opulence never see Him standingbefore them with the rod of punishment in His hand. Therefore if Lord Kåñëadesires the actual good fortune of some person, He brings him down from his position of opulence.</div>
<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa ordered Indra to return to his proper position in heaven and toserve there without egotism. Indra, along with the cow Surabhi, thenperformed a bathing ceremony for Kåñëa, using the water of the heavenlyGanges and the milk of mother Surabhi. Indra and the cow took thisopportunity to bestow upon the Lord the name Govinda, and the demigods showered flowers and recited various prayers.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The great Bhägavatam commentator Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has masterfullyexplained the Sanskrit elements of this profound verse.The Sanskrit word dhäma has several meanings: a) dwelling place, house,abode and so on; b) a favorite thing or person; delight; or pleasure; c) form orappearance; d) power, strength, majesty, glory, splendor or light.Concerning the first set of meanings, the Vedänta-sütra states that theAbsolute Truth is the source and resting place of all existence, and in the firstverse of the Bhägavatam that Absolute Truth is said to be Kåñëa. AlthoughLord Kåñëa exists in His own dhäma, or abode, called Kåñëaloka, He Himself isthe abode of all existence, as Arjuna confirms in the Bhagavad-gétä, where he addresses Kåñëa as paraà dhäma, "the supreme abode."</div>
<div class="First">The very name Kåñëa indicates the all-attractive person, and thus LordKåñëa, the source of all beauty and pleasure, is certainly "the favorite thing orperson; delight; and pleasure." Ultimately these terms can refer only to Kåñëa.Dhäma also refers to form or appearance, and as Indra offered these prayershe was in fact directly seeing the form of Kåñëa before him.As clearly explained in the Vedic literature, Lord Kåñëa's power, strength,majesty, splendor and effulgence are all contained within His transcendentalbody and thus attest to the infinite glories of the Lord.Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has brilliantly summarized all these meanings of theword dhäma by giving the Sanskrit term svarüpa as a synonym. The wordsvarüpa means "one's own form or shape" and also "one's own condition,character or nature." Since Lord Kåñëa, being pure spirit, is nondifferent fromHis body, there is absolutely no difference between the Lord and His visibleform. By contrast, in this material world we conditioned souls are all distinctlydifferent from our bodies, whether those bodies be male, female, black, whiteor whatever. All of us are eternal souls, different from our temporary, flimsy bodies.</div>
<div class="First">When the word svarüpa is applied to us, it especially indicates our spiritualform, because our "own form" is in fact our "own condition, character ornature" eternally. Thus the liberated condition in which one's outward form isone's deepest spiritual nature is called svarüpa. Primarily, however, this termrefers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa. This is all indicatedin this verse by the words tava dhäma, as explained by Çrédhara Svämé.Çrédhara Svämé has explained that here the word çäntam means "always inthe same form." Çäntam can also mean "undisturbed, free from passion, orpurified." According to Vedic philosophy, all change in this world is caused bythe influence of passion and ignorance. The passionate mode is creative, andthe ignorant mode is destructive, whereas the mode of goodness, sattva, isserene and sustaining. In many ways this verse emphasizes that Lord Kåñëa isfree from the modes of nature. The words viçuddha-sattvam, çäntam,dhvasta-rajas-tamaskam and guëa-sampraväho na vidyate te all indicate this.Unlike Kåñëa, we change from one body to another because of ourinvolvement with the modes of nature; the various transformations of materialforms are impelled by the modes of nature, which are themselves set in motionby the influence of time. Therefore one who is free from the material modes ofnature is changeless and eternally satisfied in blissful spiritual existence. Thusthe word çäntam indicates that the Lord is undisturbed by change, since He is free from the material modes of nature.</div>
<div class="First">According to this verse, the powerful flow of the material modes ofnature—namely passion, stupidity and mundane piety—are based onagrahaëa, which Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has translated as "ignorance." Since theSanskrit root graù means "to take, accept, grasp or comprehend," grahaëameans "grasp" exactly in the sense of "to grasp an idea or fact." Thereforeagrahaëa here means one's failure to understand one's spiritual position, andthis failure causes one to fall into the violent currents of material existence.An additional meaning of the word agrahaëa is derived when it is dividedinto the compound agra-haëa. Agra means "the first, top or best," and hanameans "killing." The best part of our existence is the pure soul, which iseternal, in contradistinction to the temporary, material body and mind. Thusone who chooses material existence over Kåñëa consciousness is in fact killingthe best part of himself, the soul, which in its pure state can enjoy Kåñëa consciousness unlimitedly.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Çrédhara Svämé has translated tapo-mayam as "full of knowledge." Theword tapas, generally indicating "austerity," is derived from the Sanskrit verbtap, whose meaning can be summarized as indicating the various functions ofthe sun. Tap means "to burn, to shine, to heat and so on." The Supreme Lord iseternally perfect, and therefore here tapo-mayam does not indicate that Histranscendental body is meant for austerities, since austerities are performed byconditioned souls to purify themselves or to acquire a particular power. Anomnipotent, perfect being neither purifies Himself nor acquires power: He iseternally pure and all-powerful. Therefore Çrédhara Svämé has intelligentlyunderstood that in this case the word tapas refers to the illuminating functionof the sun and thus indicates that the Lord's self-effulgent body is omniscient.Light is a common symbol of knowledge. The Lord's spiritual effulgence doesnot merely illuminate physically, as in the case of a candle or light bulb; moreimportantly, the Lord's body illuminates our consciousness with perfectknowledge because the Lord's effulgence is itself perfect knowledge.We offer our respectful obeisances at the lotus feet of Çréla Çrédhara Sväméand thank him for his enlightening comments on this verse.</div>

<div class="Translation"> How, then, could there exist in You the symptoms of an ignorant person—such as greed, lust, anger and envy—which are produced by one's previous involvement in material existence and which cause one to become further entangled in material existence? And yet as the Supreme Lord You impose punishment to protect religious principles and curb down the wicked.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This complex philosophical statement by Indra may be analyzed as follows:In the first line of this verse, Indra refers to the main idea expressed at the endof the previous verse—namely, that the great currents of material existence,which are based on ignorance, cannot possibly exist within the Supreme Lord.The words tad-dhetavaù and tat-kåtäù indicate that something causes themodes of nature to manifest, and that they in turn become the cause of thatwhich caused them. In the second line of this verse, we find that it is materialfeelings such as greed, lust, envy and anger that cause the modes of nature tomanifest and that are themselves caused by the modes of nature.The explanation of this seeming paradox is as follows: When theconditioned soul decides to associate with the material qualities, he becomescontaminated by those qualities. As stated in the Gétä (13.22), käraëaàguëa-saìgo 'sya sad-asad-yoni-janmasu. For example, in the presence of aseductive woman, a man may give in to his lower instincts and try to enjoy sexwith her. By his deciding to associate with the lower qualities of nature, thosequalities manifest in him very powerfully. He is overwhelmed with lust anddriven to try again and again to satisfy his burning desire. Because his mindhas been infected by lust, all that he does, thinks and speaks will be influencedby his strong attachment to sex. In other words, by choosing to associate withthe lusty qualities of nature, he has caused them to powerfully manifest withinhimself, and eventually those lusty qualities themselves will cause him toaccept another material body suitable for affairs governed by those qualities.The lower qualities, such as lust, greed, anger and envy, areabudha-liìga-bhäväù, symptoms of ignorance. Indeed, as indicated by ÇrélaÇrédhara Svämé in his commentary, the manifestation of the modes of nature issynonymous with the manifestation of a particular material body. It is clearlyexplained throughout the Vedic literature that the conditioned soul receives aparticular body, gives it up and then accepts another simply because of hisinvolvement with the modes of nature(käraëaà guëa-saìgo 'sya [Bg. 13.22]).Thus to say that one is participating in the modes of nature is to say that one isaccepting particular types of bodies suitable for the particular material qualities one is involved with.</div>
<div class="First">An ignorant bystander might have simplistically interpreted Kåñëa'spastime of lifting Govardhana Hill as follows: The residents of Våndävanawere obliged by Vedic principles to make certain offerings to the god ofheaven, Indra. Child Kåñëa, ignoring the position of Indra, usurped theseofferings and took them for His own pleasure. When Indra tried to punishKåñëa and His associates, the Lord frustrated Indra's attempt, humiliated him, and exhausted his pride and resources.</div>
<div class="First">But this superficial interpretation is refuted in this verse. Here Lord Indraaddresses Çré Kåñëa as bhagavän, indicating that He is not an ordinary childbut in fact God. Therefore Kåñëa's punishing Indra was part of His mission ofprotecting religious principles and curbing down the envious; it was not adisplay of material anger or of greed for the offerings meant for Indra. ÇréKåñëa is pure spiritual existence, and His simple, sublime desire is to engage allliving beings in the perfect, blissful life of Kåñëa consciousness. Kåñëa's desireto make us Kåñëa conscious is not egotistical, since ultimately Kåñëa iseverything and Kåñëa consciousness is objectively the best consciousness. LordIndra is really the humble servant of Kåñëa, a fact he is now beginning to remember.</div>

<div class="First">History is filled with examples of the supreme authority breaking theconceit of foolish men. Modern world leaders proudly fight one another,placing the common people in unprecedented jeopardy. Similarly Indra, proudof his apparently illustrious position, dared to threaten the lives of theinnocent residents of Våndävana with terrible weapons, until his arrogancewas curbed by the dynamic response of the Supreme Lord.Nowadays, governments in the Western countries tend to be electeddemocratically, and thus the mass of people become identified with the destinyof their leaders. When the proud leaders engage in violence, the people whoelected them bear the brunt of such belligerent decisions. Thus the people inthe democratic nations of the world should elect Kåñëa conscious leaders, whowill establish an administration consonant with the laws of God. If they fail todo so, their materialistic leaders, oblivious of the will of the Supreme Lord, willundoubtedly be chastised by cataclysmic events, and the people who electedsuch leaders, being responsible for their leaders' acts, will share in the suffering.</div>
<div class="First">It is ironic that in modern democracies not only do the leaders considerthemselves universal controllers, but the mass of people, considering theleaders merely their representatives rather than the representatives of God,also consider themselves, as a people, to be the controllers of their nation.Thus the chastisement mentioned in this verse has become unprecedentedly applicable to people in general in the modern world.</div>
<div class="First">Modern man should not simply make himself a lesson of nature by fallingdown from his proud position; rather he should submissively execute the will ofthe all-attractive Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, Çré Kåñëa, andusher in a new era of sanity, tranquillity and widespread enlightenment.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Although Lord Kåñëa protected the residents of Vraja by liftingGovardhana Hill, He had not yet punished Indra himself, and Indra fearedthat at any moment Çré Kåñëa might call the son of Vivasvän, Yamaräja, who punishes impudent persons who defy the laws of God.</div>
<div class="First">Indra was quite fearful and thus begged the Lord's forgiveness on the pleathat he could be purified only by Kåñëa's mercy—that he was too stubborn to learn a good lesson through mere punishment.</div>
<div class="First">In fact, despite Indra's humility in this case, his heart was not completelypurified. Later on in this canto we find that when Lord Kåñëa once took apärijäta flower from Indra's kingdom, poor Indra again reacted violentlyagainst the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus, we should aspire to go backto our eternal home in the kingdom of Kåñëa, and should not becomeentangled in the imperfect life of the material gods.</div>

<div class="Translation"> You descend into this world, O transcendent Lord, to destroy the warlords who burden the earth and create many terrible disturbances. O Lord, you simultaneously act for the welfare of those who faithfully serve Your lotus feet.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This verse utilizes an attractive poetic device. Lord Kåñëa's descent into theworld is said to be for the abhava, literally "nonexistence" or "destruction," ofthe demoniac warlords, and simultaneously for the bhava, or "existence,prosperity," of those who faithfully serve the Lord's lotus feet.True existence, indicated here by the word bhava, is sac-cid-änanda, eternaland full of bliss and knowledge. To an uninformed observer, it may appear thatÇré Kåñëa is simply rewarding His followers and punishing His enemies the wayany ordinary person might do. This specific doubt about the Lord is raisedextensively in the Sixth Canto in connection with Kåñëa's taking the side ofthe faithful demigods against the faithless demons in a particular cosmic war.In that canto the Vaiñëava authorities clearly explain that in fact Lord Kåñëais the father and Lord of all living beings and that all His activities aretherefore meant for the benefit of all existence. Lord Kåñëa does not reallycause the nonexistence of anyone; rather He curbs the foolish, destructive,material ways of those who defy the laws of God. These laws are created toensure the prosperity, harmony and happiness of the entire creation, and their violation is an unjustifiable disturbance.</div>
<div class="First">Certainly Indra hoped that Lord Kåñëa would count him among thedevotees and not the demons, although considering Indra's actions one mightdoubt where his loyalties actually lay. Indra was aware of this possible doubtand thus, as we find in the next verse, he tried his best to surrender to the Supreme Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">We could hardly construe from the first line of this verse that God issomehow impersonal but assumes a personal material body. It is clearly saidhere that the Lord assumes different forms according tosvacchanda—according to His own desire or according to the desires of Hisdevotees. An impersonal God could hardly reciprocate with the personaldesires of Its devotees, nor could an impersonal God Itself have desires, sincedesire is characteristic of personality. Therefore, the Lord's manifestingdifferent forms in a personal way, responding to personal desires, indicatesthat He is eternally a person and manifests His different transcendental bodies as an expression of His own eternal nature.</div>
<div class="First">The word viçuddha-jïäna-mürtaye is most significant. Mürti means the formof the Deity, and it is specifically stated here that the Lord's form is itselfcompletely pure consciousness. Consciousness is the primary spiritual element,distinct from any of the material elements, and even distinct from the subtleor psychological material elements—mundane mind, intelligence and falseego—which are simply a psychic covering over pure consciousness. Since theLord's form is made of pure consciousness, it can hardly be understood as amaterial body like the mortal bags of flesh and bones we carry around in this world.</div>
<div class="First">In the last two lines of this verse, there is poetic emphasis on the wordsarva, "everything." The Lord is everything: He is the seed of everything andHe is the Soul of every creature. Therefore, let us join with Indra in offering our obeisances to the Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">One may argue, "God should desire everyone's real welfare; therefore whyshould Lord Kåñëa state in this verse that He removes the intoxicatingopulence of one who is about to receive His mercy, rather than simply statingthat He will remove everyone's opulence and bless everyone?" On the otherhand, we may point out that irrevocable death occurs for everyone, and thusLord Kåñëa does take away everyone's opulence and everyone's false pride.However, if we apply the Lord's statement to events within one's immediatelife, before death, we may refer to Kåñëa's statement in the Bhagavad-gétä(4.11): ye yathä mäà prapadyante täàs tathaiva bhajämy aham. "As peoplesurrender to Me, I reward them accordingly." Lord Kåñëa desires everyone'swelfare, but when He says here yasya cecchämy anugraham, "for one whosewelfare I desire," it is understood that the Lord refers to those who by theirown activities and thoughts have manifested a desire to achieve spiritualbenefit. Lord Kåñëa wants everyone to be happy in Kåñëa consciousness, butwhen He sees that a specific person also desires spiritual happiness, the Lordespecially desires it for that person. This is a natural act of reciprocationconsistent with the Lord's statement samo 'haà sarva-bhüteñu: "I am equal in My attitude to all living beings." (Bg. 9.29)</div>

<div class="Chapnum">28. Kåñëa Rescues Nanda Mahäräja from the Abode of</div>
<div class="First"> Varuëa</div>
<div class="First">This chapter describes how Lord Kåñëa brought Nanda Mahäräja back fromthe abode of Varuëa and how the cowherd men saw Vaikuëöha.The king of the cowherds, Nanda Mahäräja, observed the prescribed fast onthe eleventh day of the lunar month and then considered how to break his fastproperly on the twelfth day. By circumstance only a few more minutesremained, and so he decided to take his bath at the very end of the night,although astrologically that was an inauspicious time. Thus he entered thewater of the Yamunä. A servant of Varuëa, the demigod of the ocean, noticedNanda Mahäräja entering the water at a time forbidden by scripture and tookhim away to the demigod's abode. In the early morning the cowherd menunsuccessfully searched for Nanda, but Lord Kåñëa immediately understoodthe situation and went to see Varuëa. Varuëa worshiped Kåñëa with great andvariegated festivity. Afterwards he begged the Lord to forgive his servant for having foolishly arrested the king of the cowherds.</div>
<div class="First">Nanda was amazed to see the influence Çré Kåñëa exerted in the court ofVaruëadeva, and after returning home he described his experiences to hisfriends and relatives. They all thought Kåñëa must be the Supreme Personalityof Godhead Himself and wanted to see His supreme abode. Thereupon theomniscient Personality of Godhead arranged for them to bathe in the samelake where Akrüra would have his vision of the Absolute Truth. There theLord revealed to them Brahmaloka, which is realized by great sages in their mystic trance.</div>

Thus he entered the water to batheat an inauspicious time, before the first dawn light.The servant of Varuëa who arrested Nanda Mahäräja is stated here to bean asura, or demon, for obvious reasons. First, the servant was foolishlyignorant of Nanda Mahäräja's position as the pastime father of the SupremeAbsolute Truth. Also, Nanda Mahäräja's intention was to carry out theinjunctions of scripture; therefore Varuëa's servant should not have arrestedNanda on the technical grounds that he bathed in the Yamunä at aninauspicious time. Later in this chapter Varuëa himself will say, ajänatämämakena müòhena: "This was done by my ignorant servant, who is a fool."This foolish servant did not understand the position of Kåñëa or Nanda Mahäräja or devotional service to the Lord.</div>

<div class="First">Technically, Nanda Mahäräja was correct in entering the water just beforesunrise. The following explanation is given by Çréla Jéva Gosvämé in hiscommentary on the first verse of this chapter: After an especially shortEkädaçé, measuring only eighteen hours, about six hours of the lunar day inwhich the fast had to be broken, namely the Dvädaçé, had already expiredbefore the dawn. Since at sunrise the proper time for breaking the fast wouldhave passed, Nanda Mahäräja decided to enter the water at an otherwise inauspicious time.</div>
<div class="First">Of course, Varuëa's servant should have been aware of these technicaldetails, which are meant for strict followers of the Vedic rituals. Above andbeyond that, Nanda Mahäräja was acting as the Supreme Lord's father and wastherefore a most sacred person, beyond the touch of insignificant cosmic bureaucrats like the foolish servant of Varuëa.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has elaborately explained how this verse applies to theeternally liberated residents of Çré Våndävana, the Lord's abode. One of thefundamental philosophical principles of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam is thedistinction between two types of illusion, Yoga-mäyä and Mahä-mäyä, thespiritual and material states of existence, respectively. Although Kåñëa is God,the omnipotent, omniscient Supreme Being, His intimate associates in thespiritual world love Him so much that they see Him as their beloved child,friend, lover and so on. So that their ecstatic love can transcend theboundaries of mere reverence, they forget that Kåñëa is the Supreme God of allthe universes, and thus their pure, intimate love expands unlimitedly. Onemay consider their activities of treating Kåñëa as a helpless child, a handsomeboyfriend, or a playmate to be a manifestation of avidyä, ignorance of LordKåñëa's position as God, but the residents of Våndävana are in fact ignoringthe secondary majesty of Kåñëa and focusing intensely on His infinite beauty, which is the essence of His existence.</div>
<div class="First">In fact, describing Lord Kåñëa as the supreme controller and God is almosta type of political analysis, referring as it does to a hierarchy of power andcontrol. Such analysis of levels of power and hierarchies of rule is significantin a context in which one entity is not fully surrendered, in love, to a higherentity. In other words, control becomes visible, or is consciously felt as control,when there is resistance to that control. To cite a simple example: A pious,law-abiding citizen sees a policeman as a friend and well-wisher, whereas acriminal sees him as a threatening symbol of punishment. Those who areenthusiastic about government policies feel not that the government is controlling them but rather that it is helping them.</div>
<div class="First">Thus Lord Kåñëa is seen as a "controller," and hence as "the Supreme God,"by those who are not fully enchanted by His beauty and pastimes. Those fullyin love with Lord Kåñëa focus on His sublime, attractive features and, becauseof the nature of their relationship with Him, do not much notice His controlling power.</div>
<div class="First">A simple proof that the residents of Vraja have transcended lower states ofGod consciousness rather than failed to attain them is the fact thatthroughout the pastimes of the Lord they often "remember" that Kåñëa is God.Usually they are astonished at this remembrance, having been fully absorbed in seeing Kåñëa as their friend, lover and so on.</div>
<div class="First">The word käma is conventionally used to indicate a material desire, or elsea spiritual desire so intense that it becomes somehow analogous to intensematerial desires. Still, the fundamental distinction remains: material desire isselfish and self-gratificatory; spiritual desire is free of selfishness, being whollyfor the pleasure of the other, the Lord. Thus the residents of Våndävanaexecuted their daily activities solely for the pleasure of their beloved Kåñëa.It should be remembered that the entire purpose of Kåñëa's descent into thisworld is to attract living beings back home, back to Godhead. Two things arerequired for this: that His pastimes display the beauty of spiritual perfection,and that they somehow seem relevant and hence interesting to theconditioned souls of this world. The Bhägavatam often states that Lord Kåñëaplays just like a youthful actor, and He undoubtedly engages His eternaldevotees in the dramatic presentation. Thus Lord Kåñëa here muses to Himselfthat people in this world certainly do not know their ultimate destination, andwith an obvious touch of the facetious He also thinks in this way about Hisown eternally liberated associates, who were playing in this world like ordinary members of a cowherd village.</div>
<div class="First">Apart from the double meaning obviously present in this verse when it isapplied to Kåñëa's liberated associates, Kåñëa here makes an entirely direct andpointedly critical observation about ordinary people. When applied toconditioned souls who are actually wandering throughout the universe, Hisstatement that people are acting out of ignorance and lust is not mitigated byany deeper, spiritual meaning. People in general are simply ignorant, and theydo not seriously consider their ultimate destination. As usual, Lord Çré Kåñëa isable to say many profound and complex things in a few simple words. Howfortunate we are that God is not a dry field of energy, a transcendent,effulgent blob, or nothing at all—as various people would have it. In fact, He isthe most wonderful Personality of Godhead, full of absolute personal qualities,and certainly whatever we can do, He can do better, as evidenced by His brilliant way of speaking.</div>

<div class="First">The unlimited extension of spiritual light, called the brahmajyoti in Text 15,is compared to a lake called Brahma-hrada. Lord Kåñëa submerged the cowherdmen in that lake in the sense that He submerged them in the awareness of theimpersonal Brahman. But then, as indicated by the word uddhåtäù, He liftedthem up to a higher understanding, that of the Personality of Godhead in Hisown planet. As clearly stated here, dadåçur brahmaëo lokam: They saw, just asAkrüra did, the transcendental abode of the Absolute Truth.The evolution of consciousness may be briefly summarized as follows: Inordinary consciousness we perceive and are attracted to the variety of materialthings. Rising to the first stage of spiritual consciousness, we transcendmaterial variety and focus instead on the undifferentiated One, which liesbehind and gives existence to the many. Finally, rising to Kåñëa consciousness,we find that the absolute, spiritual One contains its own eternal variety. Infact, since this world is a mere shadow of eternal existence, we would expect tofind spiritual variety within the One, and indeed we do find it in the sacred text of Çrémad-Bhägavatam.</div>

<div class="First">Although the residents of Våndävana considered themselves ordinarypersons, Lord Kåñëa wanted them to know of their extraordinary good fortune.Thus, within a lake in the Yamunä River the Lord showed them His personalabode. The cowherd men were amazed to see that the kingdom of God hadexactly the same spiritual atmosphere as their own earthly Våndävana andthat, just as in their Våndävana Lord Kåñëa was personally present, in theirunique vision He was present as the Lord of the spiritual world.As Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura points out, these versesemphasize that Lord Kåñëa did not merely show the cowherd men a sampleVaikuëöha planet but that He specifically revealed His Kåñëaloka, the greatestof eternal abodes and the natural home of the residents of Våndävana, who loved Kåñëa more than anyone else did.</div>

<div class="Chapnum">29. Kåñëa and the Gopés Meet for the Räsa Dance</div>
<div class="First">This chapter describes how Lord Çré Kåñëa, intending to enjoy the räsadance, engaged in arguments and counterarguments with the gopés. Then thereis a description of the beginning of the räsa dance and the Lord's pastime of disappearing from the midst of the gopés.</div>
<div class="First">Remembering the promise He had made to the gopés when He had stolentheir clothes, Lord Kåñëa employed His Yogamäyä potency and manifestedwithin Himself the desire to enjoy pastimes during an autumn night. Thus Hebegan to play His flute. When the gopés heard the flute's sound, the impulses ofCupid were violently aroused within them, and they immediately abandonedall their household duties and hastily went to Kåñëa. All the gopés had purelyspiritual bodies, but when some of the gopés' husbands and other familymembers stopped the young girls from going, Lord Kåñëa arranged for them totemporarily exhibit material bodies, which they then left at the sides of theirhusbands. In this way they deceived their relatives and went off to meet Kåñëa.When the gopés came before Lord Kåñëa, He asked, "Why have you come? Itis not good for you to travel to such a place in the dead of the night, for thisforest is full of violent creatures. Your husbands and children will soon comesearching after you to bring you home and engage you again in your householdduties. After all, the prime religious duty of a woman is to serve her husbandand children. For a respectable woman to consort with a paramour is totallycontemptible and sure to obstruct her progress to heaven. Moreover, onedevelops pure love for Me not by physical proximity but by hearing topicsconnected with Me, by viewing My Deity form in the temple, by meditatingupon Me and by faithfully chanting My glories. Therefore, all of you would do best to return home."</div>
<div class="First">The gopés were crestfallen to hear this, and after crying a little they replied,with a bit of anger, "It is very unfair for You to reject young girls who haveabandoned everything in their lives and come to You with the exclusive desireto serve You. By serving our husbands and children we receive only pain,whereas by serving You, the dearmost Soul of all living beings, we willperfectly fulfill the true religious duty of the self. What woman will not deviatefrom her prescribed duties as soon as she hears Your flute song and sees Yourform, which enchants the three worlds? Just as the Supreme Lord Viñëuprotects the demigods, You destroy the unhappiness of the people ofVåndävana. Therefore You should immediately relieve the torment we havefelt because of separation from You." Wanting to please the gopés, Lord Kåñëa,who is always satisfied in Himself, responded to their appeals by playing withthem in various pastimes. But when this show of attention made them a littleproud, He humbled them by suddenly disappearing from the arena of the räsa dance.</div>

To fulfill His purposes He employed His internal potency.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">As we begin the famous narration of Lord Kåñëa's räsa dance, a dance oflove with beautiful young girls, questions will inevitably arise in the minds ofordinary people regarding the propriety of God's romantic dancing with manyyoung girls in the middle of a full-moon autumn night. In his description of theLord's räsa dance in Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, ÇrélaPrabhupäda painstakingly explains the spiritual purity of these transcendentalactivities. Those advanced in the science of Kåñëa—the great teachers, oräcäryas—leave no doubt that Lord Kåñëa is full and satisfied in Himself, freeof all material desire, which is, after all, a sense of incompleteness or lack.Materialistic persons and impersonal philosophers stubbornly reject thebona fide explanation of Çré Kåñëa's transcendental nature. There is no reasonto deny the beautiful reality of an absolute person able to perform absoluteromantic activities, of which our so-called romance is merely a shadow orperverted reflection. The irrational insistence that material activities cannotbe a reflection of the perfect, spiritual activities performed by God reflects theunimaginative emotional disposition of those who oppose the reality of ÇréKåñëa. This psychological disposition of the nondevotees, which leads them tofervently deny the very existence of the absolute person, unfortunately boilsdown to what may be succinctly described as envy, since the overwhelmingmajority of the impersonal critics eagerly pursue their own romantic affairs, which they consider quite real and even "spiritual."</div>
<div class="First">The actual supreme lover is Lord Kåñëa. The Vedänta-sütra begins bydeclaring that the Absolute Truth is the source of everything, and evenWestern philosophy was born in a somewhat awkward attempt at finding theoriginal One behind the apparent many of material existence. Conjugal love,one of the most intense and demanding aspects of human existence, canhardly have nothing at all to do with supreme reality.In fact, the conjugal love experienced by human beings is a mere reflectionof spiritual reality, in which the same love exists in an absolute, pristine state.Thus it is clearly stated here that when Kåñëa decided to enjoy the romanticatmosphere of autumn, "He resorted to His spiritual potency" (yoga-mäyämupäçritaù). The spiritual nature of Lord Kåñëa's conjugal affairs is a major theme in this section of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam.</div>
<div class="First">A woman is attractive because of the sweet sound of her voice, her beautyand gentleness, her enchanting fragrance and tenderness, and also because ofher cleverness and skill in music and dance. The most attractive ladies of allare the young gopés of Våndävana, who are Lord Kåñëa's internal potency, andthis chapter tells how He enjoyed their brilliant feminine qualities—eventhough, as Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has mentioned, Lord Kåñëawas an eight-year-old boy when these events took place.Ordinary people prefer God simply to be a witness of their romantic affairs.When a boy desires a girl or a girl desires a boy, sometimes they pray to God fortheir enjoyment. Such people are shocked and dismayed to find out that theLord can enjoy His own loving affairs with His own transcendental senses. Intruth, Çré Kåñëa is the original Cupid, and His exciting conjugal pastimes will be described in this section of the Bhägavatam.</div>
<div class="First">When Lord Kåñëa descends to the earth, His spiritual body seems to takebirth and grow as He displays His variegated pastimes. The Lord could hardlyallow His boyhood to pass without exhibiting the supreme loving affairsbetween a young boy and young girls. Thus Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkuraquotes Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé as follows: kaiçoraà saphalé-karoti kalayan kuïjevihäraà hariù. "Lord Hari perfects His youth by arranging loving pastimes in the groves of the Våndävana forest."</div>

<div class="First">Throughout the Tenth Canto, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura giveselaborate poetic commentaries on Lord Kåñëa's pastimes. It is not alwayspossible to include these extensive descriptions, but we will quote in itsentirety his comments on this verse. It is our sincere recommendation to thelearned Vaiñëava community that a qualified devotee of the Lord present theentire commentary of Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté on the Tenth Canto as aseparate book, which will undoubtedly be appreciated by devotees andnondevotees alike. The äcärya's comments on this verse are as follows:"In this context we will make our analysis according to the methoddescribed in Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé's Ujjvala-nélamaëi. There are two categoriesof gopés: the eternally perfect (the nitya-siddhas) and those who have becomeperfect by practicing bhakti-yoga (the sädhana-siddhas). The sädhana-siddhasare of two categories: those who belong to special groups and those who do not.And there are also two classes of the gopés belonging to special groups: namelythe çruti-cärés, who come from the group of the personified Vedas, and theåñi-cärés, who come from the group of sages who saw Lord Rämacandra in the Daëòakäraëya forest.</div>
<div class="First">"This same fourfold categorization of the gopés is given in the Padma Puräëa:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">gopyas tu çrutayo jïeyä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">åñi-jä gopa-kanyakäù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">deva-kanyäç ca räjendra</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na mänuñyäù kathaïcana</div>
<div class="First">'It is understood that some of the gopés are personified Vedic literatures, whileothers are reborn sages, daughters of cowherds, or demigod maidens. But by nomeans, my dear King, are any of them ordinary humans.' Here we are informedthat although the gopés appeared to be human cowherd girls, they actually werenot. Thus the contention that they are mortals is refuted."The daughters of cowherds, referred to here as gopa-kanyäs, must beeternally perfect, since we never hear of them having executed any sädhana.Their apparent sädhana of worshiping goddess Kätyäyané in the role of gopésmerely manifests their manner of playing like human beings, and theBhägavatam narrates the account of this worship only to show how they had fully taken on the role of cowherd girls.</div>
<div class="First">"That the gopa-kanyä gopés are actually nitya-siddhas, eternally perfectdevotees of the Lord, is established by a statement in Brahma-saàhitä(5.37)—änanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhävitäbhiù—which proves that they arethe Lord's spiritual pleasure potency. Similarly, we have the words of theGautaméya-tantra, hlädiné yä mahä-çaktiù. Further corroboration of theireternal perfection is that these gopés, being coeternal with Lord Kåñëa, theirlover, are mentioned along with Him in the eighteen-syllable mantra, theten-syllable mantra and others, and also that the worship of these mantras, andalso the çrutis that present them, have been in existence since beginningless time."</div>
<div class="First">The deva-kanyäs, daughters of the demigods, who are mentioned in theverse beginning sambhavas tv amara-striyaù, are explained in ÇréUjjvala-nélamaëi as partial expansions of the gopés who are eternally perfect.That the çruti-cäré gopés, the personified Vedas, are sädhana-siddha isunderstood from the following words of theirs quoted in the Båhad-vämana Puräëa:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kandarpa-koöi-lävaëye</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tvayi dåñöe manäàsi naù</div>

<div class="First">"The åñi-cäré gopés are also sädhana-siddha, as stated in Ujjvala-nélamaëi:gopälopäsakäù pürvam apräptäbhéñöa-siddhayaù. Previously they were allmahärñis living in the Daëòaka forest. We find evidence for this in the Padma Puräëa, Uttara-khaëòa:</div>

<div class="Verse-in-purp">tato muktä bhavärëavät</div>
<div class="First">This verse says that upon seeing Lord Rämacandra, the sages in the Daëòakaforest desired to enjoy Lord Hari (Kåñëa). In other words, the sight of LordRäma's beauty reminded them of Lord Hari, Gopäla, their personal object ofworship, and they then wanted to enjoy with Him. But out of embarrassmentthey did not act on that desire, whereupon Lord Çré Räma, who is like a desiretree, gave His mercy to them, even though they had not voiced their request.Thus their desire was fulfilled, as stated by the words beginning te sarve. Bymeans of their lusty attraction they became freed from the ocean of materialexistence, the cycle of birth and death, and coincidentally they got the association of Hari in conjugal love.</div>
<div class="First">"In the present verse of the Bhägavatam we understand that it was the gopéswho had children who were kept forcibly at home. This fact is clear fromverses yet to come: mätaraù pitaraù puträù (SB 10.29.20),yat-paty-apatya-suhådäm anuvåttir aìga (SB 10.29.32) andpati-sutänvaya-bhrätå-bändhavän (SB 10.31.16). In his comments on the TenthCanto, Çréla Kavi-karëapüra Gosvämé mentions this fact. Without trying torepeat all his thoughts on this verse, we will give the gist of his purport:" 'Upon seeing the personal form of Lord Çré Rämacandra, the sages whowere worshipers of Lord Gopäla immediately became elevated to the matureplatform of spontaneous devotion, automatically reaching the stages of firmfaith, attraction and attachment. But they had not yet completely freedthemselves of all material contamination; therefore Çré Yogamäyä-deviarranged for them to take birth from the wombs of gopés and become cowherdgirls. By associating with the eternally perfect gopés, some of these new gopésfully manifested pürva-raga loving attraction for Kåñëa as soon as they reachedpuberty (This kind of attraction develops even before one meets the beloved.)When these new gopés got the direct audience of Kåñëa and physicallyassociated with Him, all their remaining contamination became burned up,and they achieved the advanced stages of prema, sneha and so on." 'Even though they were in the company of their cowherd husbands, by thepower of Yogamäyä the gopés remained unsullied by sexual contact with them;rather, they were situated in purely spiritual bodies that Kåñëa enjoyed. On thenight they heard the sound of Kåñëa's flute, their husbands tried to stop them,but by the merciful assistance of Yogamäyä the sädhana-siddha gopés were ableto go forth to their beloved, together with the nitya-siddha gopés." 'Other gopés, however, because of not getting the good fortune ofassociating with the nitya-siddha gopés and other advanced gopés, had notachieved the stage of prema, and so their contamination was not completelyburned away. They entered the company of their cowherd husbands and, aftersexual union with them, gave birth to children. But a short time later eventhese gopés developed their pürva-raga by hankering intensely for the physicalassociation of Kåñëa—a hankering they acquired by associating with theadvanced gopés. Becoming worthy recipients of the mercy of the perfectedgopés, they assumed transcendental bodies fit to be enjoyed by Kåñëa, andwhen Yogamäyä failed to help them overcome their husbands' attempts to keepthem from going out, they felt themselves cast into the worst calamity.Viewing their husbands, brothers, fathers and other family members asenemies, they came close to dying. Just as other women might remember theirmothers or other relatives at the time of death, these gopés remembered thesole friend of their very life, Kåñëa, as stated in the present verse of the Bhägavatam, beginning with the word antar.</div>
<div class="First">" 'It is implied that those ladies were not able to exit because they were heldback by their husbands, who were standing before them with sticks in theirhands, scolding them. Although these gopés were perpetually absorbed in lovefor Kåñëa, at that particular time they meditated upon Him and cried outwithin: "Alas, alas, O only friend of our life! O ocean of the artistic skills ofVåndävana forest! Please let us become your girlfriends in some future life,because at this time we cannot see Your lotuslike face with our eyes. So be it;we shall look upon You with our minds." Each of them lamenting to herself inthis way, the gopés stood with their eyes shut and meditated deeply upon Him.'"</div>

<div class="Translation"> For those gopés who could not go to see Kåñëa, intolerable separation from their beloved caused an intense agony that burned away all impious karma. By meditating upon Him they realized His embrace, and the ecstasy they then felt exhausted their material piety. Although Lord Kåñëa is the Supreme Soul, these girls simply thought of Him as their male lover and associated with Him in that intimate mood. Thus their karmic bondage was nullified and they abandoned their gross material bodies.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté comments upon this verse as follows: "HereÇukadeva Gosvämé speaks in a peculiar way: he presents the intimate objectthe gopés attained as if it were an external idea, thus keeping its true naturesecret from outsiders, while at the same time he reveals to the confidentialdevotees well versed in the scientific conclusions of devotional service theinternal meaning that is his real purport. Thus to outsiders Çukadeva says thatKåñëa gave the gopés liberation, but to the confidential hearers Çukadevareveals that when the gopés experienced separation from their beloved therearose in them both immeasurable unhappiness and immeasurable happiness, and that they gradually achieved their desired goal.</div>
<div class="First">"Thus the verse can be understood as follows: Because of their intolerableseparation from their beloved, the gopés felt terrible agony, by which theycaused all inauspicious things to tremble. In other words, when people ingeneral hear of the gopés' extreme agony in separation from their beloved, theyabandon thousands of inauspicious things—things even as fearsome as thesubterranean fires of millions of universes or the powerful poison swallowed byLord Çiva. More specifically, those who hear of the gopés' love in separationgive up their terrible false ego and, thinking themselves defeated, are shaken.When the gopés meditated on Lord Acyuta, He became manifest andpersonally came to them, and they experienced great joy by embracing Hisbody, which was full of transcendental love for them. The gopés alsoexperienced great joy by exhibiting personal characteristics and a sense ofidentification appropriate to such love. That joy made all their good fortune,both material and spiritual, seem paltry by comparison."The implication is that when other persons see how happy the gopésbecame upon embracing Kåñëa when He manifested Himself directly beforethem, these other persons feel that thousands of so-called auspicious objectsare insignificant by comparison, including all the sense gratificatory pleasuresfound in millions of universes and even the supersensory pleasure of spiritualbliss (brahmänanda) . Thus hearing of the gopés' distress and the joy that arose,respectively, out of their separation from the Supreme Lord and their unionwith Him, anyone can get rid of all the reactions of his past activities, bothsinful and pious. Vaiñëavas certainly do not think that sinful and piousreactions can be destroyed only by being lived out, since, after all, neitherseparation from the Supreme Lord nor direct association with Him are in thecategory of karma. This kind of elimination of karmic reactions occurs in thestage of bhajana, for those who have come to the level of anartha-nivåtti."And thus the gopés thought of Kåñëa—the Paramätmä, or supreme worthyobject of all love—as their paramour. Even though such a concept is ordinarilycontemptible, the gopés realized Kåñëa in an even fuller sense than didRukmiëé and His other queens, who thought of Him most respectfully as theirhusband. That thinking of the Lord as one's paramour is superior to thinkingof Him as one's husband is proved by the fact that unbridled pure love issuperior to domesticated love. This idea is borne out by the following words ofÇré Uddhava: yä dustyajaà sva-janam ärya-pathaà ca hitvä. 'These ladies ofVraja abandoned their families and their advanced religious principles, even though to do so is very difficult.' (SB 10.47.61)</div>
<div class="First">"In His pastimes on earth Kåñëa often turns the most lowly things into themost elevated. As Bhéñma stated, Kåñëa's pastime of acting as Arjuna's chariotdriver was even more elevated than the pastimes in which He acted as amighty King of kings: vijaya-ratha-kuöumba ätta-totre/ dhåta-haya-raçminitac-chriyeskñaëéye. 'I concentrate upon the chariot driver of Arjuna, who stoodwith a whip in His right hand and a bridle rope in His left, and who was verycareful to protect Arjuna's chariot by all means.' (SB 1.9.39) Similarly, in theLord's appearance as Kåñëa we see that the normally inferior conjugal räsabecomes better than the normally superior mood of çänta-rasa, as also theattitude of loving a paramour becomes superior to the loving exchangebetween legitimate spouses, and lowly guïjä necklaces, red oxide paste andpeacock feathers become better than the most excellent jeweled ornaments."But, it may be objected, it is not fitting for the Supreme Lord to sport withwomen whose bodies have already been enjoyed by other men. This objectionis replied to by the words beginning jahuù. The word deham is used here in thesingular form to indicate unity of category, even though the gopés are many.Some authorities say that by the power of Yogamäyä these gopés' bodiesdisappeared in a way no one noticed, but other authorities say that the 'body'referred to in this context is the inferior body, composed of the modes ofmaterial nature. Thus by the prominence of the adjective guëa-mayam, it isunderstood that before the gopés heard the sound of Kåñëa's flute their bodieshad been twofold, material and spiritual, and upon hearing the flute they gaveup the material bodies, which their husbands had enjoyed. We may analyze this as follows:</div>
<div class="First">"When devotees begin prosecuting devotional service in accordance withthe instructions of a bona fide spiritual master, they engage their ears andother senses in pure devotion by hearing of the Lord, chanting His glories,remembering Him, offering obeisances to Him, giving Him personalattendance, and so forth. Thus the devotees make the Lord's transcendentalqualities the objects of their senses, as stated by the Lord Himself: nirguëomad-apäçrayaù. (SB 11.25.26) In this way the devotees' bodies transcend thematerial modes. Yet sometimes the devotees may take as their sense objectsmundane sounds and so on, and that is material. Thus a devotee's body can have two aspects, transcendental and material.</div>
<div class="First">"According to one's level of devotional service, to that degree thetranscendental aspects of one's body become prominent and the materialaspects diminish. This transformation is described in the following verse from the Bhägavatam (11.2.42):</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhaktiù pareçänubhavo viraktir</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">anyatra caiña trika eka-kälaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">prapadyamänasya yathäçnataù syus</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tuñöiù puñöiù kñud-apäyo 'nu-ghäsam</div>
<div class="First">'Devotion, direct experience of the Supreme Lord, and detachment from otherthings—these three occur simultaneously for one who has taken shelter of theSupreme Personality of Godhead, in the same way that pleasure, nourishmentand relief from hunger come simultaneously and increasingly, with each bite,for a person engaged in eating.' When one achieves totally pure love of God,the material portions of the body disappear and the body becomes completelyspiritual. Nonetheless, so as not to disturb the false opinions of atheists and soas to protect the confidentiality of devotional service, the Supreme Lordusually has His illusory energy exhibit the demise of the gross body. Anexample of this is the disappearance of the Yädavas during the Mauñala-lélä."Sometimes, however, to proclaim the excellence of bhakti-yoga, Kåñëa willallow a devotee to go back to Godhead in his selfsame body, as in the case ofDhruva Mahäräja. We can cite evidence for this point from the Twenty-fifth Chapter of the Eleventh Canto, Text 32:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yeneme nirjitäù saumya</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">guëä jévena citta-jäù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhakti-yogena man-niñöho</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mad-bhäväya prapadyate</div>
<div class="First">'A living entity who conquers the modes of material nature, which aremanifested from the mind, can dedicate himself to Me [Kåñëa] by the processof devotional service and thus attain pure love for Me.' Here the Lord statesthat the defeat and destruction of that which is composed of the modes ofmaterial nature can be brought about only by the process of devotional service."Therefore, what we should understand from the present verse of theBhägavatam is that the gopés who could not go to see Kåñëa had theirinauspicious, material bodies removed or burned up, while their auspicious,spiritual bodies, far from being destroyed, simply grew more prominent becauseof the ecstasy the gopés felt by embracing Kåñëa in meditation. Thus theirbondage was completely destroyed: by the help of Yogamäyä they got free fromignorance and also from the prohibitions of their husbands and other relatives."We should not make the mistake of explaining this falling away of thegopés' bodies as being a result of their dying. As the Lord Himself states (SB</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">10.47.37),</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yä mayä kréòatä rätryäà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">vane 'smin vraja ästhitäù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">alabdha-räsäù kalyäëyo</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mäpur mad-vérya-cintayä</div>
<div class="First">'Some of those all-auspcious gopés could not directly join Me in enjoying theräsa dance on that night in this Våndävana forest, yet still they achieved Myassociation by remembering My transcendental pastimes.' By using the wordkalyäëyaù in this verse, the Lord implies, 'Even though these gopés wanted togive up their bodies because of their husbands' prohibitions and the torment ofseparation from Me, for them to die at the very beginning of the mostauspicious festival of the räsa dance would have been displeasing to Me and thus inauspicious. So they did not die.'</div>
<div class="First">"More evidence that the gopés who were prevented from going to see Kåñëadid not physically die is provided by a statement of Çré Çukadeva's later in thiscanto (10.47.38): tä ücur uddhavaà prétäs tat-sandeçägata-småtéù. 'Then they[the gopés] replied to Uddhava, feeling satisfied because His message hadreminded them of Kåñëa.' Here we understand that the gopés speaking toUddhava were the ones who had not had the chance to participate directly inthe räsa dance because of being held captive in their homes. Thus theconclusion is that they gave up their material bodies without dying. Parched bythe intense heat of separation, their material bodies gave up their materialityand became purely spiritual, just like the bodies of such great devotees asDhruva Mahäräja. This is the meaning of the gopés' 'giving up their bodies.'"The following analogy illustrates the statuses of the various gopés: Byobserving seven or eight ripe mangoes on a tree, we can ascertain that all thefruits on the tree are ripe. Then we can pick them all and bring them home,where in due course the sun's rays and other agents will make themfine—looking, fragrant and delicious—fit to be offered to the king for hisenjoyment. When the time comes for the king to take his meal, adiscriminating servant can choose those fruits ready to offer him. From theappearance of the fruits the servant can tell which are ripe in the middle butstill raw on the outside and thus not yet fit for the king. By the application of aspecial heating process, these remaining fruits will become ripe in two or threedays, and then they too will be ready to offer to the king."Similarly, among the muni-cäré gopés who took birth in Gokula, those whocompletely gave up the materiality of their bodies and very early in lifeachieved purely spiritual bodies were able to remain untouched by any otherman; thus Yogamäyä allowed them to join the nitya-siddha and other advancedgopés when they went to meet Kåñëa. Other muni-cäré gopés still retained someconnection with the external material body, but even they, after beingparched by the heat of separation from Çré Kåñëa, gave up the materiality oftheir bodies and assumed perfectly transcendental bodies, purified of all taintof contact with other men. On the night of the räsa dance, Yogamäyä sentsome of these gopés out behind those who had already gone out; others, whoYogamäyä saw still had a slight amount of contamination, she kept back tofurther purify with the heat of separation, and then she sent them out on some other night.</div>
<div class="First">"After enjoying the pleasures of the räsa dance and other pastimes withKåñëa, the muni-cäré gopés who had participated went back to their homeswhen the night was over, as did the nitya-siddha and other advanced gopés. Butnow Yogamäyä protected these muni-cäré gopés from the material association oftheir husbands; in other words, these gopés were devoid of any selfishattachment for husband, children and so on. Since these gopés were thoroughlyimmersed in the great ocean of love for Kåñëa, their breasts dried up so thatthey could not feed their infants, and to their family members they appeared asif haunted by ghosts. In conclusion, it is not unseemly that the gopés who werepreviously in material association joined in the räsa dance."Some authorities, however, maintain that the gopés who were kept back intheir houses did not have children. According to them, whenever such wordsas apatya ('children') are used in verses yet to come, these words refer to thechildren of co-wives, to adopted children or to nephews and nieces."</div>

In fact, all other powers are His energy and thus functionaccording to His will. The Brahma-saàhitä (5.44) states, såñöisthiti-pralaya-sädhana-çaktir ekä/ chäyeva yasya bhuvanäni bibharti durgä/icchänurüpam api yasya ca ceñöate sä: "The mighty Durgä, who creates,maintains and annihilates the material worlds, is the potency ot the SupremeLord, and she moves like His shadow, according to His desire." Thus becausethe Lord's spiritual influence does not depend on whether someoneunderstands Him or not, the gopés' spontaneous love for Kåñëa guaranteed their spiritual perfection.</div>

At that time Kåñëa nonchalantly cut off Çiçupäla's head andgave him liberation. Everyone present saw the effulgent soul of Çiçupäla riseout of his dead body and merge into the existence of the Lord. The SeventhCanto explains that Çiçupäla was an incarnation of a gatekeeper in thespiritual world cursed to take birth on the earth as a demon.

<div class="Translation"> Persons who constantly direct their lust, anger, fear, protective affection, feeling of impersonal oneness or friendship toward Lord Hari are sure to become absorbed in thought of Him.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa is pure spiritual existence, and those who somehow or otherbecome attached to Him, absorbed in thoughts of Him, rise to the spiritualplatform. This is the absolute nature of the Lord's personal association.With this verse Çukadeva Gosvämé answers King Parékñit's question aboutthe gopés. After all, Çukadeva has begun to narrate Kåñëa's most intimatepastime, the räsa dance, and Parékñit is cooperating to remove the doubts ofothers who are hearing or who in the future may hear this astonishing story.Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted a statement from the Skanda Puräëa thatemphatically declares persons like the gopés to be liberated souls, beyond the pale of material illusion:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhaktyä hi nitya-kämitvaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">na tu muktià vinä bhavet</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ataù kämitayä väpi</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">muktir bhaktimatäà harau</div>
<div class="First">"Eternal conjugal attraction to Kåñëa, expressed in pure devotional service,cannot develop in one who is not already liberated. Thus those who aredevoted to Lord Hari, even in conjugal attraction, are already liberated ."Çréla Madhväcärya then quotes from the Padma Puräëa to clarify theessential point that one cannot be liberated simply by lusting after Lord Kåñëabut rather only by possessing conjugal attraction in pure devotional service:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sneha-bhaktäù sadä deväù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">kämitsenäpsara-striyaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">käscit käscin na kämena</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhaktyä kevalayaiva tu</div>
<div class="First">"The demigods are always affectionately devoted to the Lord, and the youngladies of heaven called Apsaräs have lusty feelings toward Him, although someof them have pure devotion for Him untainted by material lust. Only theselatter Apsaräs are ready for liberation, because without bona fide devotional service one cannot possibly achieve liberation."</div>
<div class="First">Thus devotional service is not yogyam, or appropriate, unless free frommaterial lust. One should not take cheaply the gopés' achievement of personalassociation with Lord Kåñëa in a conjugal relationship. To show the gravity ofdirect relationship with the Lord, Çréla Madhväcärya has quoted the following verses from the Varäha Puräëa:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">patitvena çriyopäsyo</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">brahmaëä me piteti ca</div>

<div class="First">"Brahmä is the spiritual master of this universe, and Viñëu is the eternallyworshipable Deity. With this understanding, and not otherwise, one should worship the Lord."</div>
<div class="First">The above injunctions apply to sarva-jana, "all people in general." Thus oneshould follow these injunctions until one achieves the exalted platform ofintimate relationship with the Supreme Lord. There is abundant evidence thatthe gopés of Våndävana were highly elevated, liberated souls, and thus theirpastimes with Kåñëa are pure, spiritual affairs. Keeping this in mind, we cantruly understand this chapter of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam .</div>

<div class="Translation"> This night is quite frightening, and frightening creatures are lurking about. Return to Vraja, slender-waisted girls. This is not a proper place for women.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has written the following charming commentary on this verse:</div>
<div class="First">"[The gopés thought,] 'Alas, alas, even after shattering our familyresponsibilities, our sobriety and our shame and enjoying us day after day, andafter now dragging us here by the sound of His flute, He is asking us why we have come!'</div>
<div class="First">"As the gopés cast sidelong glances at one another, the Lord said, 'If you tryto tell Me that you have come to get night-blooming flowers to use in theworship of God, and that it is these flowers you are looking at with yoursidelong glances, I will have to reject your excuse as unacceptable, sinceneither the time, place nor persons involved are appropriate.'"This is the Lord's meaning in the verse beginning rajané. He might havesaid, 'Even though there is abundant moonlight, this time of night is veryfearsome because many snakes, scorpions and other dangerous creatures toosmall for you to see are lying beneath the creepers, roots and twigs. Thereforethis time is unsuitable for gathering flowers. And not only the time but alsothis place is unsuitable for you to gather flowers, because at night terriblecreatures such as tigers are abroad here. Therefore you should go back to Vraja.'</div>
<div class="First">" 'But,' the gopés may object, 'let us just rest for a few minutes, and then we will go.'</div>
<div class="First">"Then the Lord might reply, 'Women shouldn't remain in this kind ofplace.' In other words, 'Because of the time and place, it is wrong for persons like yourselves to stay here even for a moment.'</div>
<div class="First">"Furthermore, by the word su-madhyamäù, 'O slender-waisted ones,' theLord implied, 'You are beautiful young girls, and I am a beautiful young boy.Because you are all very chaste and I am a brahmacäré, as confirmed by thewords kåñëo brahmacäré in the çruti [Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad], there should beno fault in our being in the same place. Nonetheless, the mind can never be trusted-neither yours nor My own.'</div>
<div class="First">"The Lord's inner eagerness thus hinted at is obvious if we read His wordsbetween the lines, as follows: 'If out of shyness you cannot tell Me the reasonyou've come, then don't speak. I already know it anyway, so just listen as I tellit to you.' Thus the Lord speaks the words beginning rajané . "The following statement by Kåñëa is based on an alternative meaning of theverse derived when the Sanskrit words are separated in a different way. Thealternative separation, according to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté, would berajané eñä aghora-rüpä aghora-sattva-niñevitä/ pratiyäta vrajaà na iha stheyaàstribhiù su-madhyamäù. Through Çréla Viçvanätha's commentary Kåñëa now explains the meaning of this division of words.</div>
<div class="First">" 'The pervasive moonshine has made this night appear not at all fearsome,and therefore this forest is populated by harmless creatures such as deer(aghora-sattvaiù), or else by animals such as tigers that are harmless because ofVåndävana's naturally nonviolent atmosphere. Consequently this night shouldnot frighten you.' Or else Kåñëa may have meant, 'You should not be afraid ofyour own husbands and other relatives because, the night being populated byfearsome animals, they will not come near this place. Therefore please do notgo back to Vraja [na pratiyäta], but stay here in My company [iha stheyam].'"The gopés may ask the Lord, 'How are You staying here?' "The Lord answers, 'With women.'</div>
<div class="First">"But are You satisfied to keep just any women in Your company?'"The Lord replies to this with the word su-madhyamäù, meaning, 'Onlywomen who are young and beautiful, who have slender waists—namelyyourselves—should stay here with Me, and not others.' Thus we can appreciatethat Kåñëa's statements are full of considerate as well as neglectful sentiments."Kåñëa's words are certainly brilliant, because according to the rules ofSanskrit grammar they may be understood in either of two opposite ways. Inthe first case, as translated above, Lord Kåñëa continues to tease the gopés bytelling them the night is dangerous and inauspicious and that they should gohome. But Kåñëa is simultaneously saying exactly the opposite—namely, thatthere is absolutely no reason for the gopés to fear coming to the Lord, that thenight is quite auspicious and that the girls should under no circumstances goback home. Thus Lord Kåñëa simultaneously teases and enchants the gopés with His words.</div>

The word satéù means that the gopés are loyal to their husbands;therefore Kåñëa indicates that the gopés should serve their husbands so thelatter can accomplish their religious duties, and that the gopés should also beconsidered worshipable because of their chastity. All this Kåñëa says to thegopés who are married. And now to the unmarried girls He says, 'The calves arecrying, so see to it that they get milk.' To the muni-cäré gopés He says, 'Your babies are crying, so feed them milk.' "</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura further reveals the hidden meaningof these two verses as follows: "In Text 21 Kåñëa might have said, 'ThisVåndävana is the very best of places, and moreover this is a full-moon night.Furthermore, we have the Yamunä on all sides, and there are cool, gentle,fragrant breezes blowing. These are all transcendental opulences that stimulateloving exchanges, and since I am also here as the foremost ecstaticopulence—the object of love—let us now test how much expertise you can show in relishing rasas.'</div>
<div class="First">"In Text 22 He means to say, 'Thus for a long time, for the entire durationof this night, don't leave, but rather stay here and enjoy with Me. Don't goserve your husbands and the gentle women—your mothers-in-law and so forth.It would not be fitting for you to waste such beauty and youth, which are giftsof the creator. Nor should you milk the cows or give milk to the calves andbabies. What do you, who are so full of ecstatic attraction for Me, have to do with these affairs?' "</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura also explains that the gopés could notreally be sure exactly what Kåñëa was doing—whether He was merely joking,inviting them to stay or instructing them to return home. Thus as Çré Kåñëaspoke about the beauty of the forest, the gopés felt embarrassed and bewilderedand looked upward at the trees, and as He spoke about the Yamunä theylooked all around at the river. Their absolute purity and simplicity, along withtheir absolute devotion to Lord Kåñëa in the conjugal mood, created the most beautiful pastimes ever exhibited in this universe.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté quotes a similar statement from småti-çästra:patià tv apatitaà bhajet. "One should serve a master who is not fallen."Sometimes the foolish argument is given that even if a husband falls downfrom spiritual principles, his wife should continue to follow him since he is her"guru." In fact, since Kåñëa consciousness cannot be subordinated to any otherreligious principle, a guru who engages his follower in materialistic, sinfulactivities loses his status as a guru. Çréla Prabhupäda stated that the system ofmonarchy collapsed in Europe because the monarchs abused and exploitedtheir position. Similarly, in the Western world men have abused and exploitedwomen, and now there is a popular movement in which women reject theauthority of their husbands. Ideally, men should be staunch in spiritual life andgive pure, sincere guidance to the women under their care.The gopés, of course, being on the highest platform of spiritual perfection,were transcendental to all positive and negative religious considerations. Inother words, they were the eternal lovers of the Absolute Truth.</div>

Lord Kåñëa was not going to neglectthe gopés; rather, He would increase the power of their loving affairs bymaking another spectacular arrangement. After all, the gopés were basicallyproud of Kåñëa.

<div class="Chapnum">30. The Gopés Search for Kåñëa</div>
<div class="First">This chapter describes how the gopés, tormented through the long night byseparation from Kåñëa, wandered like madwomen from forest to forest in search of Him.</div>
<div class="First">When Çré Kåñëa suddenly disappeared from the arena of the räsa dance, thegopés, their minds fully absorbed in thoughts of Him, began looking for Him inthe various forests. From all the moving and nonmoving creatures they askedfor news of Kåñëa's whereabouts. Finally they became so distraught that they began imitating His pastimes.</div>
<div class="First">Later, while wandering in a corner of the forest, the gopés saw Çré Kåñëa'sfootprints, which appeared mixed with Çrématé Rädhäräëé's. Seeing thesefootprints perturbed them greatly, and they declared that surely ÇrématéRädhäräëé must have worshiped Kåñëa with unusual excellence, since She hadbeen privileged to associate with Him in seclusion. Further along the path thegopés came to a place where they could no longer see Çrématé Rädhäräëé'sfootprints; they then concluded that Kåñëa must have taken Rädhäräëé ontoHis shoulders. In another place they noticed that Kåñëa's footprints wereshowing only the toes, and thus the gopés concluded He had been pickingflowers with which to decorate His beloved. In yet another spot the gopés sawsigns that led them to imagine that Çré Kåñëa had been tying the locks ofÇrématé Rädhäräëé's hair. All these thoughts brought pain to the gopés' minds.Because of the special attention She received from Kåñëa, Çré Rädhä beganto consider Herself the most fortunate of women. She told Him that She couldwalk no further and that He would have to carry Her on His shoulders. Butjust then Lord Kåñëa disappeared from Her sight. Çrématé Rädhäräëé,extremely troubled, then began looking everywhere for Him, and when Shefinally met Her gopé girlfriends She related to them what had happened. Allthe gopés then went out to look for Kåñëa in the forest, going as far as themoonlight reached. But in the end they were unsuccessful, so they went backto the shore of the Yamunä and simply sang Kåñëa's glories in utter helplessness.</div>

Anyway, what is the use of unnecessarilycriticizing the residents of a holy place? We cannot tell if they really knowwhere Kåñëa has gone. So let us find someone who definitely knows where Heis.' Thus the gopés concluded that since Lord Kåñëa had to be somewhere on the earth, the earth herself must know His whereabouts.</div>

You are eager to realize the ecstasy of seeingKåñëa, and thus your eyes are following Him. In fact, He is never lost to you.'"Then the gopés, seeing the doe continue to walk in her natural way,exclaimed, 'Oh, are you telling us that you have seen Kåñëa? Look! As this deerwalks she constantly turns her head back to us; as if to say, "I will show Him toyou; just follow me and I will show you Kåñëa." In this merciless Våndävana, she is the only merciful person.'</div>
<div class="First">"As the gopés follow the doe they happen to lose sight of her, and they cryout, 'Oh, why can't we see the deer who is showing us the way to Kåñëa?'"One gopé suggests that Kåñëa must be somewhere in the vicinity and thatthe deer, being afraid of Him, must have hidden herself to avoid the possiblemistake of revealing His presence. Conjecturing in this way, the gopés detect afragrance that has by chance blown their way, and they repeatedly declarewith great joy, 'Yes! Yes! This is it! By Kåñëa's physical contact with Hisgirlfriend, His jasmine garland was smeared with the kuìkuma powder on Herbreasts, and the fragrances of all these things are reaching us.' Thus the gopéssmelled the aroma of the two lovers' bodies, of Kåñëa's jasmine garland, and of the cosmetic powder on the breasts of His lover."</div>

A vertical line extends from the middle of Her footto the juncture of Her large and second toes. At the base of the middle toe is alotus, below that is a flag with a banner, and below the flag is a creeper,together with a flower. At the base of Her small toe is an elephant goad, andupon Her heel is a half-moon.

<div class="Translation"> [Çukadeva Gosvämé continued:] Lord Kåñëa enjoyed with that gopé, although He enjoys only within, being self-satisfied and complete in Himself. Thus by contrast He showed the wretchedness of ordinary lusty men and hardhearted women.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This verse directly refutes the superficial criticism materialistic peoplesometimes direct against Lord Kåñëa's pastimes. The philosopher Aristotleclaimed that ordinary activities are unworthy of God, and with this idea inmind some people declare that since the activities of Lord Kåñëa resemblethose of ordinary human beings, He cannot be the Absolute Truth .But in this verse Çukadeva Gosvämé emphatically points out that LordKåñëa acts on the liberated platform of spiritual self-satisfaction. This fact isindicated here by the terms ätma-rata, ätmäräma and akhaëòita. It isinconceivable to ordinary people that a handsome young boy and a beautifulyoung girl enjoying romantic conjugal affairs in the forest moonlight can beengaging in pure activity, free from egoistic desire and lust. Yet while LordKåñëa is inconceivable to ordinary persons, those who love Him can easily realize the absolute, pure nature of His activities.</div>
<div class="First">One may argue that "beauty is in the eye of the beholder" and thattherefore the devotees of Kåñëa are only imagining the Lord's activities to bepure. This argument ignores many significant facts. For one, the path of Kåñëaconsciousness, of developing love for Kåñëa, demands that a devotee strictlyfollow four regulative principles: no illicit sex, no gambling, no intoxicationand no eating of meat, fish or eggs. When one is freed from material lust andrises to the liberated platform, beyond material desire, one realizes the absolutebeauty of Lord Kåñëa. This process is not theoretical: it has been practiced andcompleted by many thousands of great sages, who have left us their shiningexample and their brilliant teachings concerning the path of Kåñëa consciousness.</div>
<div class="First">Certainly beauty is in the eye of the beholder. However, real beauty isperceived by the soul's eye and not by the lusty eye of the material body.Therefore the Vedic literature repeatedly stresses that only those freed frommaterial desire can see the beauty of Lord Kåñëa with the eye of the pure soul,anointed with love of Godhead. It may finally be noted that upon realizing thepastimes of Lord Kåñëa one becomes free of all tinges of sex desire, a state ofmind that can hardly result from meditating upon material sexual affairs.One final note: The conjugal pastimes of Kåñëa perfectly round out Hisqualification as the Supreme Absolute Truth. The Vedänta states that theAbsolute Truth is the source of everything, so certainly the Absolute cannotlack any of the beautiful things of this world. It is only because romantic affairsexist in a pure, spiritual form in the Absolute that they can manifest in aperverted, material form in this world. Thus the apparent beauty of this worldis not to be absolutely rejected; rather, beauty should be accepted in its pure, spiritual form.</div>
<div class="First">Since the beginning of time men and women have been inspired to poeticrapture by the art of romance. Unfortunately, romance in this world usuallyleads to crushing disappointment, brought about by a change of heart or bydeath. Thus although we may at first find romantic affairs beautiful andenjoyable, they are eventually spoiled by the onslaught of material nature.Still, it is unreasonable to totally reject the concept of romance. Rather, weshould accept conjugal attraction in its absolute, perfect, pure form, as it existswithin God, without a tinge of material lust or selfishness. That pure conjugalattraction—the supreme beauty and pleasure of the Supreme Truth—is whatwe are reading about here in the pages of Çrémad-Bhägavatam.</div>

<div class="Chapnum">31. The Gopés' Songs of Separation</div>
<div class="First">This chapter relates how the gopés, overwhelmed by feelings of separationfrom Kåñëa, sat down on the bank of the Yamunä and began praying for His audience and singing His glories.</div>
<div class="First">Because the gopés had dedicated their minds and very lives to Kåñëa, theywere beside themselves with the transcendental pain of separation. But theircrying, which appears like evidence of misery, actually shows their exaltedstate of transcendental bliss. As it is said, yata dekha vaiñëaver vyavahäraduùkh/ niçcaya jäniha sei paramänanda sukh: "Whenever one sees a Vaiñëavaacting unhappy, one should know it for sure that he is actually experiencingthe highest spiritual bliss." Thus each of the gopés began addressing Lord ÇréKåñëa according to her individual mode of ecstasy, and they all prayed for Him for His mercy.</div>
<div class="First">As the pastimes of Kåñëa spontaneously arose in the minds of the gopés,they sang their song, which relieves the agony of those suffering from theburning pain of separation from Kåñëa and which bestows supremeauspiciousness. They sang, "O Lord, O lover, O cheater, when we rememberYour smile, Your loving glances and Your pastimes with Your boyhood friends,we become extremely agitated. Remembering Your lotus face, adorned withlocks of blackish hair smeared with the dust of the cows, we becomeirrevocably attached to You. And when we remember how You followed thecows from forest to forest with Your tender feet, we feel great pain."In their separation from Kåñëa the gopés considered a single moment anentire age. Even when they had previously seen Him they had found theblinking of their eyelids intolerable, for it blocked their vision of Him for a fraction of a second.</div>
<div class="First">The ecstatic sentiments for Lord Kåñëa that the gopés expressed may appearlike symptoms of lust, but in reality they are manifestations of their pure desireto satisfy the Supreme Lord's spiritual senses. There is not even the slightest trace of lust in these moods of the gopés.</div>

The Caitanya-caritämåta relatesthat when Lord Caitanya heard this verse, beginning tava kathämåtam, Heimmediately arose in ecstatic love and embraced King Pratäparudra. Theincident is described in detail in the Caitanya-caritämåta (Madhya 14.4-18),and in his edition Çréla Prabhupäda has given extensive commentary on it.</div>

<div class="Chapnum">32. The Reunion</div>
<div class="First">This chapter describes how Çré Kåñëa manifested Himself in the midst ofthe gopés, who had become extremely disturbed by their separation from Him.After He consoled them, they expressed to Him their deep feelings of ecstasy.The gopés having shown in various ways their great eagerness to see Kåñëa,the attractor of Cupid, He appeared before them wearing silken yellowgarments and a beautiful flower garland. Some of the gopés, overwhelmed withecstasy at seeing Him, grasped His hands, others placed His arm on theirshoulders, and others accepted the remnants of betel nut He had chewed. Thus they served Him.</div>
<div class="First">One gopé, impelled by loving anger toward Kåñëa, bit her lip and lookedaskance at Him. Because the gopés were so attached to Kåñëa, they were notsatiated even by continuously gazing at Him. One of them then placed Kåñëawithin her heart, closed her eyes and, embracing Him within herself again andagain, became absorbed in transcendental bliss, just like a yogé. In this way thepain the gopés had felt because of separation from the Lord was dispelled.Next Lord Kåñëa went to the bank of the Yamunä in the company of thecowherd girls, His internal potencies. The gopés then made a seat for Kåñëa outof their shawls, and after He had sat down they enjoyed with Him by gesturingamorously. The gopés still felt hurt that Kåñëa had disappeared, so Heexplained to them why He had done so. He further told them that He hadcome under the exclusive control of their loving devotion and would ever remain indebted to them.</div>

Yet even if the Lord is approached by someone with devotion, tointensify the devotee's love the Lord may not immediately reciprocate fully. Infact, the Lord is truly reciprocating. After all, a sincere devotee always prays tothe Lord, "Please help me to love You purely." Therefore the Lord's so-calledneglect is actually the fulfillment of the devotee's prayer. Lord Kåñëaintensifies our love for Him by apparently separating Himself from us, and theresult is that we achieve what we really wanted and prayed for: intense love forthe Absolute Truth, Kåñëa. Thus Lord Kåñëa's apparent negligence is actuallyHis thoughtful reciprocation and the fulfillment of our deepest and purest desire.</div>

<div class="First">The translation and word meanings for this verse are taken from ÇrélaPrabhupäda's English rendering of Çré Caitanya-caritämåta (Ädi 4.180).In conclusion, the gopés became eternally glorious by their behavior in theLord's temporary absence, and the mutual love between them and the Lord waswonderfully enhanced. This is the perfection of Kåñëa and His loving devotees.</div>
<div class="First">Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A . C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Thirty-second Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Reunion."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">33. The Räsa Dance</div>
<div class="First">This chapter describes Lord Çré Kåñëa's räsa dance, which He enjoyed withHis beloved girlfriends in the forests along the Yamunä River.The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, is most expert in theknowledge of transcendental moods. In the company of the gopés, who weretightly bound to Him by the ropes of affection and totally dedicated to Hisservice, the Lord expanded Himself into numerous forms. The gopés becameintoxicated with their enthusiasm to enjoy the räsa dance, and thus theybegan satisfying Kåñëa's senses by singing, dancing and gesturing amorously.The sweet voices of the gopés filled all the directions.Even after Lord Kåñëa manifested Himself in numerous forms, each gopéthought He was standing next to her alone. Gradually the gopés becamefatigued from the continuous dancing and singing, and each of them placedher arm on the shoulder of the Kåñëa standing beside her. Some gopés smelledand kissed Kåñëa's arm, which bore the fragrance of the lotus and was anointedwith sandalwood paste. Others put Kåñëa's hand on their bodies, and yet others gave Kåñëa pleasure by embracing Him lovingly.</div>
<div class="First">Lord Kåñëa, being the Supreme Absolute Truth, is the only actual enjoyerand object of enjoyment. Although He is one without a second, He expandsHimself into many forms to increase His personal pastimes. Therefore greatscholars say that Kåñëa's räsa-lélä is like a child's playing with His ownreflection. Çré Kåñëa is self-satisfied and fully endowed with inconceivable,transcendental opulences. When He exhibits such pastimes as the räsa-lélä, allliving beings, from Brahmä down to the blades of grass, become merged in the ocean of astonishment.</div>
<div class="First">When Mahäräja Parékñit heard the narration of Kåñëa's conjugal pastimeswith the gopés, which superficially resemble the activities of lusty, wantonpersons, he expressed a doubt to the great devotee Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé.Çukadeva dispelled this doubt by stating, "Since Çré Kåñëa is the absoluteenjoyer, such pastimes as these can never be contaminated by any fault. But ifanyone other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead tries to enjoy suchpastimes, he will suffer the same fate that someone other than Lord Rudrawould suffer if he attempted to drink an ocean of poison. Moreover, even onewho only thinks of imitating Lord Kåñëa's räsa-lélä will certainly suffer misfortune."</div>
<div class="First">The Supreme Absolute Truth, Çré Kåñëa, is present within the hearts of allliving entities as their indwelling witness. When out of His mercy He exhibitsHis intimate pastimes to His devotees, these activities are never besmirched bymundane imperfection. Any living being who hears of the spontaneous lovingattraction the gopés felt for Lord Kåñëa will have his desires for material sensegratification destroyed at the root and will develop his natural propensity forserving the Supreme Lord, the spiritual master, and the Lord's devotees.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The festive räsa dance commenced, with the gopés arrayed in a circle. Lord Kåñëa expanded Himself and entered between each pair of gopés, and as that master of mystic power placed His arms around their necks, each girl thought He was standing next to her alone. The demigods and their wives were overwhelmed with eagerness to witness the räsa dance, and they soon crowded the sky with their hundreds of celestial airplanes.</div>

Each gopé saw one manifestation ofKåñëa. The demigods and their wives, however, could see all His differentmanifestations as they watched the räsa dance from their airplanes, and thus they were completely astonished.</div>

This would indicate thatalthough the gopés began the dance with their hair and belts tightly drawn, these gradually slackened and loosened.</div>

<div class="First">It is difficult to translate into English the word rasa, which indicates thespiritual bliss derived from one's loving relationship with Lord Kåñëa.

These descriptions are nevercomplete, however, since the Lord's pastimes are unlimited; thus the attemptto glorify such pastimes is still going on and will go on forever. Lord Kåñëaarranged an extraordinary season of beautiful autumn nights to enhance Hisloving affairs, and those autumn nights have inspired transcendental poets since time immemorial.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The statements of the Lord's empowered servants are always true, and the acts they perform are exemplary when consistent with those statements. Therefore one who is intelligent should carry out their instructions.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The word éçvara is usually defined in Sanskrit dictionaries as "lord, master,ruler," and also as "capable, potent to perform." Çréla Prabhupäda oftentranslated the word éçvara as "controller," which brilliantly synthesizes the twofundamental concepts of éçvara, namely a master or ruler and a capable orpotent person. A master may be incompetent, but a controller is a master orlord who in fact makes things happen. The parameçvara, the supreme éçvara,the supreme controller, is of course God, Kåñëa, the cause of all causes.Although people in general, especially in the Western countries, are notaware of the fact, powerful personalities control our universe. The modern,impersonal concept of the universe depicts an almost totally lifeless cosmos inwhich the earth floats meaninglessly. Thus we are left with the dubious"ultimate purpose" of preserving and reproducing our genetic code, which hasits own "ultimate purpose" of adding another link to the meaningless chain of events by again reproducing itself.</div>
<div class="First">In contrast to this sterile, meaningless world concocted by ignorantmaterialists, the actual universe is full of life—personal life—and in fact fullof God, who pervades and supports all that exists. The essence of reality is theSupreme Personality of Godhead and His personal relationship with theinnumerable living beings, of whom we are samples. Some of the living beingsare trapped in the illusion of materialism, or identification with the materialbody, while others are liberated, aware of their eternal, spiritual nature. Athird class comprises those progressing in self-realization from the materialisticstate of ignorance to the enlightened state of Kåñëa consciousness.Reality is ultimately personal and divine, and therefore it is not surprisingthat, as the Vedic literature reveals to us, our universe and other universes aremanaged by great personalities, just as our city, state and country are managedby empowered personalities. When we democratically award a particularpolitician the right to govern, we vote for him because he has exhibitedsomething we call "leadership" or "ability." We think, "He'll get the job done."In other words, it is only after an individual acquires the power to govern thatwe vote for him; our vote does not make him a leader but rather recognizes apower in him coming from some other source. Thus, as Lord Kåñëa explains atthe end of the Tenth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gétä, any living being exhibitingan extraordinary power, ability or authority must have been empowered by the Lord Himself or by the Lord's energy.</div>
<div class="First">Those directly empowered by the Lord are devoted to Him, and thus theirpower and influence spread goodness throughout the world, whereas those whoare empowered by the Lord's illusory potency are in an indirect relationshipwith Kåñëa because they do not directly reflect His will. Of course, they doreflect His will indirectly, since it is by Kåñëa's arrangement that the laws ofnature act upon ignorant living beings, gradually persuading them, throughtheir journey of many lifetimes, to surrender to the Supreme Lord. Thus aspoliticians create wars, false hopes and innumerable passionate schemes for thematerialistic persons who follow them, the politicians are indirectly carryingout the Lord's program of allowing the conditioned souls to experience the bitter fruit of godlessness.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura has translated the word éçvaräëämas "those who have become powerful through knowledge and austerity." As oneunderstands the nature and will of God and makes the personal sacrificerequired to achieve excellence in spiritual life, one becomes empowered by theSupreme Lord to represent His will, which one has intelligently recognized and accepted.</div>
<div class="First">The Supreme Personality of Godhead kindly descends to earth to show avivid example of religious behavior. As Lord Kåñëa states in the Bhagavad-gétä(3.24), "If I did not execute standard duties, the whole world would be misledand in fact destroyed." Thus the Lord showed, in His different incarnations,how to act properly in this world. A good example is Lord Rämacandra, who behaved wonderfully as the son of King Daçaratha.</div>
<div class="First">But when Lord Kåñëa Himself descends, He also demonstrates the ultimatereligious principle, namely that the Supreme Lord is beyond all other livingbeings and that no one can imitate His supreme position. This foremost of allreligious principles—that the Lord is unique, without equal or superior—wasclearly demonstrated in Lord Kåñëa's apparently immoral pastimes with thegopés. No one can imitate these activities without incurring dire consequences,as explained here by Çukadeva Gosvämé. One who thinks that Lord Kåñëa isan ordinary living being subjected to lust, or who accepts His räsa dance asadmirable and tries to imitate it, will certainly be vanquished, as described in Text 30 of this chapter.</div>
<div class="First">Finally, a distinction must be made between the Lord and His empoweredservants. An empowered servant of the Lord, as in the case of Brahmä, mayexperience a remnant of reactions to previous activities, according to the lawof karma. But the Lord is eternally free from any entanglement in the laws of karma. He is on a unique platform.</div>

Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura glorifies theLord's conjugal pastimes, stating that these romantic affairs have aninconceivable spiritual potency to attract the polluted heart of conditionedsouls. It is an undeniable fact that any pure—or simple—hearted person whohears narrations of the loving affairs of Kåñëa will be attracted to the lotus feet of the Lord and gradually become His devotee .</div>

<div class="First">Because the gopés loved Kåñëa exclusively, Yogamäyä protected theirrelationship with the Lord at all times, even though they were married. ÇrélaViçvanätha Cakravarté quotes from the Ujjvala-nélamaëi as follows:</div>

<div class="First">"The gopés' jealous husbands consorted not with their wives but with doublesmanufactured by Mäyä. Thus these men never actually had any intimatecontact with the divine ladies of Vraja." The gopés are the internal energy ofthe Lord and can never belong to any other living being. Kåñëa arranged theirapparent marriage to other men simply to create the excitement ofparakéya-rasa, the love between a married woman and her paramour. Theseactivities are absolutely pure because they are the Lord's pastimes, and saintlypersons since time immemorial have relished these supreme spiritual events.</div>

<div class="Translation"> After an entire night of Brahmä had passed, Lord Kåñëa advised the gopés to return to their homes. Although they did not wish to do so, the Lord's beloved consorts complied with His command.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the Bhagavad-gétä (8.17) Lord Kåñëa explains, "By human calculation, athousand ages taken together is the duration of Brahmä's one day. And suchalso is the duration of his night." Thus one thousand ages entered within asingle twelve-hour night when Lord Kåñëa performed His räsa dance. ÇrélaViçvanätha Cakravarté compares this inconceivable impression of time to thefact that many universes fit neatly within the forty-mile range of earthlyVåndävana. Or one may consider that mother Yaçodä could not encircle thesmall abdomen of child Kåñëa with numerous ropes, and that at another timeHe manifested many universes within His mouth. The transcendence ofspiritual reality above and beyond mundane physics is concisely explained in Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé's Laghu-bhagavatämåta:</div>

<div class="First">"Nothing is impossible for the Lord, His dear devotees, His transcendentalabode or the time of His pastimes, for all these entities are inconceivably powerful."</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté further explains that the wordväsudevänumoditäù indicates that Lord Kåñëa advised the gopés, "To assure thesuccess of these pastimes, you and I should keep them secret." The wordväsudeva, a name of Kåñëa, also indicates Lord Kåñëa's plenary expansion whoacts as the presiding Deity of consciousness. When the word väsudeva isunderstood in this context, the word väsudevänumoditäù indicates that thepresiding Deity of consciousness, Väsudeva, manifested embarrassment andfear of their elders within the gopés' hearts, and therefore it was only with great reluctance that the young girls returned home.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The extraordinary power of Lord Kåñëa's conjugal pastimes is clearlyrevealed here. Qualitatively, the Lord's spiritual, loving pastimes are thediametric opposite of material, lusty affairs, so much so that simply by hearingabout the Lord's pastimes a devotee conquers sex desire. By readingpornographic literature or hearing about material romance, we certainly donot conquer sex desire but rather increase our lust. But hearing or readingabout the Lord's conjugal affairs has exactly the opposite effect because theyare of the opposite nature, being purely spiritual. Therefore it is by thecauseless mercy of Lord Kåñëa that He exhibits His räsa-lélä within this world.If we become attached to this narration, we will experience the bliss ofspiritual love and thus reject the perverted reflection of that love, which iscalled lust. As nicely put by Lord Kåñëa in the Bhagavad-gétä (2.59), paraàdåñövä nivartate: "Once having directly experienced the Supreme, one will not return to material pleasures."</div>

<div class="First">This chapter describes how Lord Çré Kåñëa saved His father Nanda from theclutches of a serpent and delivered a Vidyädhara named Sudarçana from the curse of the Äìgirasa sages.</div>
<div class="First">One day Nanda Mahäräja and the other cowherd men placed their familymembers on their bullock carts and went to the Ambikävana forest to worshipLord Çiva. After bathing in the Sarasvaté River and worshiping Lord Sadäçiva,a form of Lord Viñëu, they decided to spend the night in the forest. As theyslept, a hungry serpent came and began to swallow Nanda Mahäräja. Terrified,Nanda cried out in distress, "O Kåñëa! O my son, please save this surrenderedsoul!" The cowherd men immediately awoke and began beating the serpentwith wooden torches, but the serpent would not release Nanda. Then LordKåñëa came and touched the serpent with His lotus foot. The serpent wasimmediately freed from his reptilian body and appeared in his original form asa demigod. He told them about his previous identity and described how he hadbeen cursed by a group of sages. Then he offered his homage at the lotus feet ofÇré Kåñëa and, on the Lord's order, returned to his own abode.Later, during the Dola-pürëimä festival, Çré Kåñëa and Baladeva enjoyedpastimes in the forest with the young women of Vraja. The girlfriends ofBaladeva and those of Kåñëa joined together and sang about Theirtranscendental qualities. When the two Lords became absorbed in singing tothe point of apparent intoxication, a servant of Kuvera's named Çaìkhacüòaboldly came forward and began abducting the gopés. The young girls called out,"Kåñëa, please save us!" and He and Räma began to chase after Çaìkhacüòa."Don't be afraid!" Kåñëa called out to the gopés. In fear of the Lords,Çaìkhacüòa left the gopés aside and ran for his life. Kåñëa chased after him,swiftly approached him and with a blow of His fist removed Çaìkhacüòa'sjewel, together with his head. Then Kåñëa brought the jewel back and presented it to Lord Baladeva.</div>

<div class="First">This chapter contains the songs the gopés sing to express their feelings ofseparation from Kåñëa when He goes to the forest during the day.As the gopés' mood of separation from Çré Kåñëa becomes ever more intense,His names, forms, qualities and pastimes begin spontaneously manifesting intheir hearts. Thus they join together and sing as follows: "The beauty of Kåñëaattracts the minds of all. When He stands in His threefold-bending way andplays upon His flute, the Siddhas' wives, flying in the sky with their husbands,become attracted to Him and forget external reality. The bulls, cows and otheranimals in the pasture become stunned in ecstasy, and they stand so still, withthe grass unchewed between their teeth, that they appear like figures in adrawing. Indeed, even the unconscious rivers stop flowing."Just see! When Kåñëa dresses Himself in forest array and calls the cows'names by blowing on His flute, even the trees and creepers become so ecstaticout of love that their limbs display eruptions and their sap pours down like atorrent of tears. The sound of Kåñëa's flute causes the cranes, swans and otherbirds in the lakes to close their eyes in deep meditation, the clouds in the skyto gently rumble, imitating the flute's vibration, and even such greatauthorities in the science of music as Indra, Siva and Brahmä to becomeastonished. And just as we gopés are anxious to offer everything we have toKåñëa, so the wives of the black deer follow Him about, imitating us."When Kåñëa is returning to Vraja, He constantly plays His flute while Hisyoung companions chant His glories, and Brahmä and other chief demigods come to worship His lotus feet."</div>

<div class="Translation"> My dear gopé, sometimes Mukunda imitates the appearance of a wrestler by decorating Himself with leaves, peacock feathers and colored minerals. Then, in the company of Balaräma and the cowherd boys, He plays His flute to call the cows. At that time the rivers stop flowing, their water stunned by the ecstasy they feel as they eagerly wait for the wind to bring them the dust of His lotus feet. But like us, the rivers are not very pious, and thus they merely wait with their arms trembling out of love.</div>

Although they desired the Lord, their movementwas checked by ecstasy, and their "arms," their waves, trembled with love of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Kåñëa moves about the forest in the company of His friends, who vividly chant the glories of His magnificent deeds. He thus appears just like the Supreme Personality of Godhead exhibiting His inexhaustible opulences. When the cows wander onto the mountainsides and Kåñëa calls out to them with the sound of His flute, the trees and creepers in the forest respond by becoming so luxuriant with fruits and flowers that they seem to be manifesting Lord Viñëu within their hearts. As their branches bend low with the weight, the filaments on their trunks and vines stand erect out of the ecstasy of love of God, and both the trees and the creepers pour down a rain of sweet sap. Maddened by the divine, honeylike aroma of the tulasé flowers on the garland Kåñëa wears, swarms of bees sing loudly for Him, and that most beautiful of all persons thankfully acknowledges and acclaims their song by taking His flute to His lips and playing it. The charming flute song then steals away the minds of the cranes, swans and other lake-dwelling birds. Indeed they approach Kåñëa, close their eyes and, maintaining strict silence, worship Him by fixing their consciousness upon Him in deep meditation.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has made several illuminatingcomments on these verses. He gives the analogy that just as when householderVaiñëavas hear a saìkértana party approaching they become ecstatic and offerobeisances, so the trees and creepers in Våndävana became ecstatic when theyheard Kåñëa's flute and bowed low with their branches and vines. The worddarçanéya-tilaka in Text 10 indicates not only that the Lord is "the mostexcellent (to see)," but also that He decorated Himself with attractive reddishtilaka taken from the mineral rich earth of Våndävana forest.Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté also points out that tulasé, although exalted inmany ways, is not normally considered an especially fragrant plant. However,early in the morning tulasé emits a transcendental fragrance that ordinarypeople cannot perceive but that transcendental personalities fully appreciate.The bees who are privileged to swarm about the flower garlands worn by theSupreme Personality of Godhead certainly appreciate this fragrance, and ÇrélaViçvanätha Cakravarté quotes from the Bhägavatam (3.15.19) to the effect thatthe most fragrant plants in Vaikuëöha also appreciate the special qualifications of Tulasé-devé.</div>
<div class="First">The word sandhita-veëuù in Text 10 indicates that Lord Kåñëa placed Hisflute firmly upon His lips. And the melody emanating from that flute iscertainly the most enchanting of sounds, as the gopés describe in this chapter.</div>

<div class="Translation"> As Kåñëa respectfully greets His well-wishing friends, His eyes roll slightly as if from intoxication. He wears a flower garland, and the beauty of His soft cheeks is accentuated by the brilliance of His golden earrings and the whiteness of His face, which has the color of a badara berry. With His cheerful face resembling the moon, lord of the night, the Lord of the Yadus moves with the grace of a regal elephant. Thus He returns in the evening, delivering the cows of Vraja from the heat of the day.</div>

<div class="First">This verse definitely confirms that the so-called pain of the heartbrokengopés is actually great spiritual bliss. On the material platform, pain ispain—period. But on the spiritual platform, so-called pain is simply a differentvariety of spiritual ecstasy. In the Western countries, people take pleasure inmixing different flavors of ice cream to produce wonderful combinations offlavor. Similarly, on the spiritual platform Çré Kåñëa and His devotees expertlymix the flavors of spiritual bliss, and thus every day was a treat for the gopés.Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Thirty-fifth Chapter, ofthe Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Gopés Sing of Kåñëa as He Wanders in the Forest."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">36. The Slaying of Ariñöä, the Bull Demon</div>
<div class="First">This chapter describes how Kåñëa killed Ariñöäsura and how Kaàsa reactedwhen he learned from Närada that Kåñëa and Balaräma were the sons of Vasudeva.</div>
<div class="First">The demon Ariñöa wanted to kill Kåñëa and Balaräma, and thus he assumedthe form of a huge bull with sharp horns. Everyone in Kåñëa's cowherd villagebecame terrified when Ariñöäsura approached it, but the Lord pacified them,and when the bull demon charged Him He seized him by the horns and threwhim about six yards. Though weakened, Ariñöa still wanted to attack Kåñëa.Thus, dripping with sweat, he charged the Lord once again. This time Kåñëagrabbed his horns, threw him to the ground and thrashed him like a pile of wetclothing. The demon vomited blood and gave up his life. Then Kåñëa andRäma, while being honored by the demigods and cowherd boys, returned to the village.</div>
<div class="First">A short time later Närada Muni, the great sage among the demigods, cameto see King Kaàsa. He informed the King that Kåñëa and Balaräma were notNanda's sons but rather Vasudeva's. It was out of fear of Kaàsa that Vasudevahad put the two boys under Nanda's care. Furthermore, said Närada, Kaàsa would meet his death at Their hands.</div>
<div class="First">Kaàsa shook with fear and anger when he heard all this, and in greatagitation he began thinking of how to destroy Kåñëa and Balaräma. He calledfor the demons Cäëüra and Muñöika and instructed them to kill the twobrothers in a wrestling match. Then he spoke to Akrüra, who was expert atexecuting his duties. Taking Akrüra by the hand, Kaàsa persuaded him to goto Vraja to bring the two boys to Mathurä. Akrüra agreed to carry out Kaàsa's order and then returned home.</div>

<div class="First">The term deva-darçana can be understood in many ways, all of which areconsistent with the context and purport of this narration. Deva means "God,"and darçanaù means "seeing" or "an audience with a great personality." Thusdeva-darçana, a name for Närada Muni, indicates that Närada has attained theperfection of seeing God, that getting Närada's audience is as good as gettingGod's (since Närada is a pure representative of the Lord), and also thatNärada's audience is as good as that of the demigods, who are also known asdevas. That there are all these meanings of the term deva-darçanaù revealssomething of the richness of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam's language.From the Puräëas, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has quoted twentyverses describing a joking conversation between Rädhä and Kåñëa that tookplace after Kåñëa had killed the demon Ariñöa.

But the actual reason Akrüra went on anew chariot was that it would have been clearly inappropriate for the SupremePersonality of Godhead to mount a chariot that had already been enjoyed by the wicked Kaàsa."</div>

<div class="Chapnum">37. The Killing of the Demons Keçi and Vyoma</div>
<div class="First">This chapter describes the killing of the horse demon, Keçé; Närada'sglorification of Lord Kåñëa's future pastimes; and Kåñëa's killing of Vyomäsura.On Kaàsa's order the Keçi demon assumed the form of a huge horse andwent to Vraja. As he approached, his loud neighing terrified all theinhabitants, and they began looking for Çré Kåñëa. When He saw the demon,Kåñëa came forward and challenged him to come near. Keçé charged Kåñëa andtried to strike Him with his front legs, but the Lord seized them, whirled thedemon around several times, and then threw him a distance of one hundredbow-lengths. Keçé remained unconscious for some time. When the demonregained consciousness, he furiously charged Kåñëa again, his mouth agape.The Lord then thrust His left arm into the horse demon's mouth, and as Keçétried to bite the arm, it felt like a red-hot iron rod. Kåñëa's arm expanded moreand more, finally choking the demon, and in extreme agony Keçé gave up hislife. Lord Kåñëa then removed His arm. He stood calmly, showing no pride athaving killed the demon, as the demigods showered down flowers from the sky and glorified the Lord with prayers.</div>
<div class="First">Soon thereafter Närada Muni, the great sage among the demigods,approached Kåñëa and prayed to Him in various ways, glorifying the Lord'sfuture pastimes. Then Närada paid his obeisances and departed.One day, while tending the cows, Kåñëa, Balaräma and the cowherd boysbecame engrossed in playing hide-and-go-seek. Some of the boys took the roleof sheep, some the role of thieves, and others shepherds. The shepherds wouldsearch for the sheep when the thieves stole them. Taking advantage of thisgame, a demon named Vyoma, sent by Kaàsa, dressed himself like a cowherdboy and joined the band of "thieves." He abducted a few cowherd boys at atime and threw them into a mountain cave, keeping them there by blockingthe entrance with a boulder. Gradually Vyomäsura abducted all but four orfive cowherd boys. When Kåñëa saw what the demon was doing, He ran afterhim, grabbed him and killed him just as one would kill a sacrificial animal.</div>

When the Supreme Personality of Godhead saw how the demon was frightening His village of Gokula by neighing terribly and shaking the clouds with his tail, the Lord came forward to meet him.

<div class="Chapnum">38. Akrüra's Arrival in Våndävana</div>
<div class="First">This chapter describes Akrüra's trip from Mathurä to Våndävana, hismeditation on Kåñëa and Balaräma along the way and the honor the two Lords showed Akrüra upon his arrival.</div>
<div class="First">Early in the morning on the day after Kaàsa had ordered him to bringKåñëa and Balaräma to Mathurä, Akrüra prepared his chariot and set off forGokula. As he traveled, he thought as follows: "I am about to attain the greatgood fortune of seeing Çré Kåñëa's lotus feet, which are worshiped by Brahmä,Rudra and the other demigods. Although Kaàsa is an enemy of the SupremeLord and His devotees, still, it is by Kaàsa's grace that I will get this great boonof seeing the Lord. When I first catch sight of His lotus feet, all my sinfulreactions will be destroyed at once. I will descend from my chariot and fall atthe feet of Kåñëa and Balaräma, and even though I have been sent by Kaàsa,the omniscient Çré Kåñëa will certainly harbor no animosity toward me." AsAkrüra thus thought to himself, he arrived in Gokula at sunset. Alighting fromhis chariot in the cowherd pasture, he began rolling about in the dust in great ecstasy.</div>
<div class="First">Then Akrüra continued on to Vraja. When he saw Kåñëa and Balaräma hefell at Their lotus feet, and both the Lords embraced him.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In this verse Akrüra establishes the all-powerful position of the SupremeLord, whom he is about to see in Våndävana. The false concept of separationfrom the Lord is described in the Eleventh Canto of the Bhägavatam (11.2.37):bhayaà dvitéyäbhiniveçataù syäd éçäd apetasya viparyayo 'småtiù. Although allexistence emanates from the Absolute Truth, Kåñëa, we imagine a "secondthing," this material world, to be entirely separate from the Lord's existence.With this mentality, we try to exploit that "second thing" for our sensegratification. Thus the psychological underpinning of material life is theillusion that this world is somehow separate from God and therefore meant for our enjoyment.</div>
<div class="First">It is ironic that the impersonal philosophers, in their radical renunciationof this world, claim it to be utterly false and totally separate from the Absolute.Unfortunately, this artificial attempt to divest this world of its divine nature,or, in other words, its relation to God, does not lead people to utterly reject itbut rather to try to enjoy it. While it is true that this world is temporary andthus in one sense illusory, the mechanism of illusion is a spiritual potency ofthe Supreme Lord. Realizing this, we should immediately desist from anyattempt to exploit this world; rather, we should recognize it as God's energy.We will actually give up our material desires only when we understand thatthis world belongs to God and is therefore not meant for our selfish gratification.</div>
<div class="First">The word abhéyate here refers to a process of surmising the presence of theLord through meditative introspection. This process is also described in the</div>

And this fact is perceived and hypothesized in ouracts of seeing and taking help from the intelligence."Akrüra states that the Lord is free of the egoistic pride afflicting ordinary,embodied souls. Yet the Lord appears to be embodied like everyone else, andtherefore someone might object to the statement that He is free of egoism.Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté comments on this puzzle as follows: "How can wedistinguish between being free of false ego and being afflicted by it? 'If a livingentity is situated in a body,' [argues the objector,] 'he will encounter theunhappiness and confusion that occur within it, just as a person living in ahouse, whether he be attached to it or not, cannot avoid experiencing thedarkness, warmth and cold that occur within it.' This objection is answered asfollows: By His internal potency the Lord dispels the darkness of ignorancealong with the separateness and bewilderment it produces."</div>

<div class="Translation"> Honored by Nanda Mahäräja with these true and pleasing words of inquiry, Akrüra forgot the fatigue of his journey. Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Thirty eighth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Akrüra's Arrival in Våndävana."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">39. Akrüra's Vision</div>
<div class="First">This chapter describes how Akrüra informed Lord Kåñëa and LordBalaräma of Kaàsa's plans and his activities in Mathurä; what the gopés criedout in distress when Kåñëa left for Mathurä; and also the vision of Lord Viñëu'sabode that Akrüra saw within the water of the Yamunä.When Kåñëa and Balaräma offered Akrüra great respect and comfortablyseated him on a couch, he felt that all the desires he had reflected on whiletraveling to Våndävana were now fulfilled. After the evening meal, Kåñëaasked Akrüra whether his trip had been peaceful and whether he was well.The Lord also inquired about how Kaàsa was behaving toward their family members, and finally He asked why Akrüra had come.</div>
<div class="First">Akrüra described how Kaàsa had been persecuting the Yädavas, whatNärada had told Kaàsa and how Kaàsa had been treating Vasudeva cruelly.Akrüra also spoke of Kaàsa's desire to bring Kåñëa and Balaräma to Mathuräto kill Them on the pretext of Their seeing the bow sacrifice and engaging in awrestling match. Kåñëa and Balaräma laughed out loud when They heard this.They went to Their father, Nanda, and informed him of Kaàsa's orders.Nanda then issued an order to all the residents of Vraja that they shouldcollect various offerings for the King and prepare to go to Mathurä.The young gopés were extremely upset to hear that Kåñëa and Balarämawould be going to Mathurä. They lost all external awareness and began toremember Kåñëa's pastimes. Condemning the creator for separating them fromHim, they began to lament. They said that Akrüra did not deserve his name (a,"not"; krüra, "cruel"), since he was so cruel to be taking away their dearmostKåñëa. "It must be that fate is against us," they lamented, "because otherwisethe elders of Vraja would have forbidden Kåñëa to leave. So let us forget ourshyness and try to stop Lord Mädhava from going." With these words theyoung cowherd girls began to chant Kåñëa's names and cry.But even as they wept, Akrüra began taking Kåñëa and Balaräma toMathurä in his chariot. The cowherd men of Gokula followed behind on theirwagons, and the young gopés also walked behind for some distance, but thenthey became placated by Kåñëa's glances and gestures and pacified by a messagefrom Him that said "I will return." With their minds completely absorbed inKåñëa, the cowherd girls stood as still as figures in a painting until they couldno longer see the chariot's flag or the dust cloud being raised on the road.Then, chanting Kåñëa's glories all the while, they despondently returned to their homes.</div>
<div class="First">Akrüra halted the chariot at the bank of the Yamunä so Kåñëa andBalaräma could perform a ritual of purification and drink some water. Afterthe two Lords had gotten back into the chariot, Akrüra took Their permissionto bathe in the Yamunä. As he recited Vedic mantras, he was startled to seethe two Lords standing in the water. Akrüra came out of the river andreturned to the chariot-where he saw the Lords still sitting. Then he returnedto the water to find out if the two figures he had seen there were real or not.What Akrüra saw in the water was four-armed Lord Väsudeva. Hiscomplexion was dark blue like a fresh raincloud, He wore yellow garments andHe lay on the lap of thousand-hooded Ananta Çeña. Lord Väsudeva wasreceiving the prayers of perfected beings, celestial serpents and demons, andHe was encircled by His personal attendants. Serving Him were His manypotencies, such as Çré, Puñöi and Ilä, while Brahmä and other demigods sangHis praises. Akrüra rejoiced at this vision and, joining his palms insupplication, began to pray to the Supreme Lord in a voice choked with emotion.</div>

<div class="Chapnum">40. The Prayers of Akrüra</div>
<div class="First">This chapter relates Akrüra's prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="First">Akrüra prayed, "Brahmä, who created this visible world, emanated from thelotus navel of the Supreme Lord. The five elements of physical nature, the fivecorresponding objects of perception, the ten senses, the ego, the total nature,the primeval creator and the demigods all originate from His bodily limbs. Hecannot be known by sensory knowledge, and thus even Brahmä and the other demigods are ignorant of His real identity.</div>
<div class="First">"Different classes of people worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead indifferent ways. Fruitive workers worship Him by performing Vedic sacrifices,philosophers by renouncing material work and pursuing spiritual knowledge,yogés by meditating, Çaivites by worshiping Lord Çiva, Vaiñëavas by followingthe injunctions of such scriptures as the Païcarätra, and other saintly personsby worshiping Him as the original form of the self, of the material substanceand of the controlling demigods. Just as rivers flow from various directions intothe ocean, the worship of those who dedicate themselves to these variousentities finds its ultimate purpose within the Supreme Lord Viñëu."The form of the total universe, the Viräö-rüpa, is imagined to be the formof Lord Viñëu. Like aquatics moving about in water or like tiny insectsburrowing in an udumbara fruit, all living beings move about within the Lord.These living beings, bewildered by His Mäyä, wander along the path ofmaterial work, falsely identifying with body, home and so forth. Under thesway of illusion, a foolish person may overlook a reservoir of water covered bygrass and leaves and instead run after a mirage. Similarly, living beings caughtin the grip of ignorance abandon Lord Viñëu and become attached to theirbodies, homes and so on. Such faithful servants of their senses cannot takeshelter of the Supreme Lord's lotus feet. Only if, by His mercy, they get theassociation of saintly devotees will their material entanglement end. Onlythen can they develop Kåñëa consciousness by serving the Lord's pure devotees."</div>

But atthe same time the Vedas state that there is one supreme controller, theAbsolute Truth. That is Çré Kåñëa, the Personality of Godhead, who expandsHis potency through material creation into the forms of the demigods. Thusworship of the demigods goes to Him through the indirect method ofkarma-käëòa, or fruitive religious rituals. Ultimately, however, one who wantsto achieve eternal perfection should worship the Lord directly, in full Kåñëa consciousness.</div>

It implies that the worshipers mentioned before have not completelypurified their intelligence of material contamination and thus worship theLord indirectly.

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Fortieth Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Prayers of Akrüra."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">41. Kåñëa and Balaräma Enter Mathurä</div>
<div class="First">This chapter describes how Lord Kåñëa entered the city of Mathurä, killed awasherman and bestowed benedictions upon a weaver and a garland-maker named Sudämä.</div>
<div class="First">After showing His Viñëu form to Akrüra in the waters of the Yamunä andreceiving Akrüra's prayers, Lord Kåñëa withdrew that vision just as an actorwinds up his performance. Akrüra emerged from the water and in greatamazement approached the Lord, who asked him whether he had seensomething wonderful while bathing. Akrüra replied, "Whatever wonderfulthings there are in the realms of water, earth or sky, all have their existencewithin You. Thus when one has seen You, nothing remains unseen." Akrüra then began driving the chariot again.</div>
<div class="First">Kåñëa, Balaräma and Akrüra reached Mathurä late in the afternoon. Aftermeeting up with Nanda Mahäräja and the other cowherds, who had gone onahead, Kåñëa asked Akrüra to return home, promising to visit him there afterHe had killed Kaàsa. Akrüra unhappily bid the Lord goodbye, went to KingKaàsa to inform him that Kåñëa and Balaräma had come, and went home.Kåñëa and Balaräma took the cowherd boys with Them to see thesplendorous city. As they all entered Mathurä, the women of the city eagerlycame out of their houses to see Kåñëa. They had often heard about Him andhad long since developed a deep attraction for Him. But now that they wereactually seeing Him, they were overwhelmed with happiness, and all their distress due to His absence was eradicated.</div>
<div class="First">Kåñëa and Balaräma then came upon Kaàsa's wicked washerman. Kåñëaasked him for some of the first-class garments he was carrying, but he refusedand even chastised the two Lords. At this Kåñëa became very angry andbeheaded the man with His fingertips. The washerman's assistants, seeing hisuntimely end, dropped their bundles of clothes on the spot and ran off in alldirections. Kåñëa and Balaräma then took some of the garments They especially fancied.</div>
<div class="First">Next a weaver approached the two Lords and arrayed Them suitably, forwhich service he received from Kåñëa opulence in this life and liberation inthe next. Kåñëa and Balaräma then went to the house of the garland-makerSudämä. Sudämä offered Them his full obeisances, worshiped Them bybathing Their feet and offering Them such items as arghya and sandalwoodpaste, and chanted prayers in Their honor. Then he adorned Them withgarlands of fragrant flowers. Pleased, the Lords offered him whatever benedictions he wished, and then They moved on.</div>

<div class="Translation"> The Lord saw Mathurä, with its tall gates and household entrances made of crystal, its immense archways and main doors of gold, its granaries and other storehouses of copper and brass, and its impregnable moats. Beautifying the city were pleasant gardens and parks. The main intersections were fashioned of gold, and there were mansions with private pleasure gardens, along with guildhalls and many other buildings. Mathurä resounded with the calls of peacocks and pet turtledoves, who sat in the small openings of the lattice windows and on the gem-studded floors, and also on the columned balconies and on the ornate rafters in front of the houses. These balconies and rafters were adorned with vaidürya stones, diamonds, crystal quartz, sapphires, coral, pearls and emeralds. All the royal avenues and commercial streets were sprinkled with water, as were the side roads and courtyards, and flower garlands, newly grown sprouts, parched grains and rice had been scattered about everywhere. Gracing the houses' doorways were elaborately decorated pots filled with water, which were bedecked with mango leaves, smeared with yogurt and sandalwood paste, and encircled by flower petals and ribbons. Near the pots were flags, rows of lamps, bunches of flowers and the trunks of banana and betel-nut trees.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">We can see a clear difference between Lord Kåñëa's dealings with the nastywasherman and His dealings with the devoted florist Sudämä. The Lord is ashard as a thunderbolt for those who defy Him and as soft as a rose for thosewho surrender to Him. Therefore we should all sincerely surrender to Lord Kåñëa, since that is clearly in our self-interest.</div>
<div class="First">Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Forty-first Chapter, of theÇrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Kåñëa and Balaräma Enter Mathurä."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">42. The Breaking of the Sacrificial Bow</div>
<div class="First">This chapter describes the benediction Trivakrä received, the breaking ofthe sacrificial bow, the destruction of Kaàsa's soldiers, the inauspicious omensKaàsa saw and the festivities at the wrestling arena.After leaving Sudämä's house, Lord Kåñëa came upon Trivakrä, a younghunchbacked maidservant of Kaàsa's who was carrying a tray of fineointments. The Lord asked her who she was and requested some ointmentfrom her. Entranced by His beauty and joking words, Trivakrä gave both Kåñëaand Balaräma a good deal of ointment. In return, Kåñëa stepped on her toeswith His lotus feet, took hold of her chin and lifted, thus straightening herspine. The now beautiful and charming Trivakrä then grabbed the edge ofKåñëa's upper cloth and asked Him to come to her house. Kåñëa replied thatafter He had taken care of some business He would certainly come and relieveher mental torment. Then the two Lords continued Their sightseeing tour of Mathurä.</div>
<div class="First">As Kåñëa and Balaräma walked along the King's road, the merchantsworshiped Them with various offerings. Kåñëa asked where the bow sacrificewas to take place, and when He arrived at the arena He saw the wonderfulbow, which resembled Lord Indra's. Despite the guards' protests, Kåñëa forciblypicked up the bow, easily strung it and in an instant broke it in half, producingan ear-splitting sound that filled the heavens and struck terror in the heart ofKaàsa. The many guards attacked Kåñëa, crying out "Seize Him! Kill Him!"But Kåñëa and Balaräma simply picked up the two halves of the bow and beatthe guards to death. Next the Lords annihilated a company of soldiers sent byKaàsa, and then They left the arena and continued Their tour.When the people of the city saw the amazing prowess and beauty of Kåñëaand Balaräma, they thought They must be two chief demigods. Indeed, as theresidents of Mathurä gazed upon the Lords, they enjoyed all the blessings the gopés had predicted.</div>
<div class="First">At sunset Kåñëa and Balaräma returned to the cowherds' camp for Theirevening meal. They then passed the night resting comfortably. But KingKaàsa was not so fortunate. When he heard how Kåñëa and Balaräma hadeasily broken the mighty bow and destroyed his soldiers, he spent the night ingreat anxiety. Both while awake and while dreaming he saw many ill omensportending his imminent death, and his fear ruined any chance for rest.At dawn the wrestling festival began. Crowds of people from the city andoutlying districts entered the arena and took their seats in the lavishlydecorated galleries. Kaàsa, his heart trembling, sat down on the royal dais andinvited Nanda Mahäräja and the other cowherd men to come sit in theirplaces, and they did so after offering him their gifts. The musical overture thenbegan as the sounds of the wrestlers slapping their arms resounded.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, the younghunchbacked girl was actually a partial expansion of the Lord's wifeSatyabhämä. Satyabhämä is the Lord's internal energy known as Bhü-çakti,and this expansion of hers, known as Påthivé, represents the earth, which wasbent down by the great burden of countless wicked rulers. Lord Kåñëadescended to remove these wicked rulers, and thus His pastime ofstraightening out the hunchback Trivakrä, as explained in these verses,represents His rectifying the burdened condition of the earth. At the sametime, the Lord awarded Trivakrä a conjugal relationship with Himself.In addition to the given meaning, the word rasa-pradaù indicates that theLord amused His cowherd boyfriends by His dealings with the young hunchback.</div>

<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté states that since the women of Mathuräimmediately experienced symptoms of conjugal attraction when they sawKåñëa, they were the most advanced devotees in the city. The ten effects ofCupid are described as follows: cakñü-rägaù prathamaà cittäsaìgas tato 'thasaìkalpaù nidrä-cchedas tanutä viñaya-nivåttis trapä-nasaù/ unmädo mürcchämåtir ity etäù smara-daçä daçaiva syuù. "First comes attraction expressedthrough the eyes, then intense attachment in the mind, then determination,loss of sleep, becoming emaciated, disinterest in external things, shamelessness,madness, becoming stunned and death. These are the ten stages of Cupid's effects."</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté also points out that devotees who possess purelove of Godhead generally do not exhibit the symptom of death, since this isinauspicious in relation to Kåñëa. They do, however, manifest the other ninesymptoms, culminating in becoming stunned in ecstasy.</div>

<div class="Translation"> Nanda Mahäräja and the other cowherds, summoned by the King of the Bhojas, presented him with their offerings and then took their seats in one of the galleries.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté, the word samähutäù indicatesthat King Kaàsa respectfully called the leaders of Vraja forward so that theycould make their offerings to the central government. According to theäcärya, Kaàsa assured Nanda as follows: "My dear King of Vraja, you are themost important of my village rulers. Yet even though you have come toMathurä from your cowherd village, you have not come to visit me. Is thatbecause you are frightened? Don't think that your two sons are bad becauseThey broke the bow. I invited Them here because I heard They were extremelypowerful, and I've arranged this wrestling match as a test of Their strength. Soplease come forward without hesitation. Don't be afraid."Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté further states that Nanda Mahäräja noticed histwo sons were not present. Apparently, out of disrespect for King Kaàsa'sorder, They had taken the morning off and gone elsewhere.Thus Kaàsa delegated some cowherd men to go look for Them and adviseThem to behave properly and come back to the wrestling arena. The äcäryaalso states that the reason Nanda and the other cowherd men sat in thegalleries was that they could not find any sitting places on the royal dais.Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Forty-second Chapter, ofthe Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Breaking of the Sacrificial Bow."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">43. Kåñëa Kills the Elephant Kuvalayäpéòa</div>
<div class="First">This chapter tells how Lord Kåñëa killed the lordly elephant Kuvalayäpéòa,how Kåñëa and Balaräma entered the wrestling arena and what Kåñëa said to the wrestler Cäëüra.</div>
<div class="First">After finishing Their early-morning rituals, Kåñëa and Balaräma heardkettledrums heralding the start of the wrestling match, and They went to seethe festivities. At the gate of the wrestling arena They encountered anelephant named Kuvalayäpéòa, who attacked Kåñëa at the urging of his keeper.The mighty elephant grabbed at Kåñëa with his trunk, but the Lord struckback and then disappeared from the beast's sight among his legs. Enraged atnot being able to see Kåñëa, Kuvalayäpéòa sought Him out with his sense ofsmell and seized Him. But the Lord pulled loose. In this way Kåñëa teased andtormented Kuvalayäpéòa, finally yanking out one of his tusks and beating him and his keepers to death.</div>
<div class="First">Sprinkled with the elephant's blood and carrying one of his tusks on Hisshoulder as a weapon, Lord Kåñëa appeared unprecedentedly beautiful as Heentered the wrestling arena. There the various classes of people saw Him indifferent ways, according to their specific relationship with Him.When King Kaàsa heard how Kåñëa and Balaräma had killedKuvalayäpéòa, he realized They were invincible and became filled withanxiety. The members of the audience, on the other hand, became joyful asthey reminded one another about the Lords' amazing pastimes. The peopledeclared that Kåñëa and Balaräma must be two expansions of the SupremeLord Näräyaëa who had descended into the house of Vasudeva.Cäëüra then stepped forward and challenged Kåñëa and Balaräma towrestle, saying King Kaàsa wished to see such a match. Kåñëa replied,"Although We are merely nomadic forest folk, We are nonetheless subjects ofthe King; thus We will not hesitate to please him with an exhibition ofwrestling." As soon as Cäëüra heard this, he suggested that Kåñëa shouldwrestle him and that Balaräma should wrestle Muñöika.</div>

<div class="First">Çréla Çrédhara Svämé quotes the following verse, which explains the ten attitudes toward Kåñëa described here:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">raudro 'dbhutaç ca çåìgäro</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">häsyaà véro dayä tathä</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhayänakaç ca bébhatsaù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">çäntaù sa-prema-bhaktikaù</div>
<div class="First">"[There are ten different moods:] fury [perceived by the wrestlers], wonder [bythe men], conjugal attraction [the women], laughter [the cowherds], chivalry[the kings], mercy [His parents], terror [Kaàsa], ghastliness [the unintelligent],peaceful neutrality [the yogés] and loving devotion [the Våñëis]."Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté points out that people like the wrestlers,Kaàsa and the impious rulers perceive Kåñëa as dangerous, angry orthreatening because they fail to understand the actual position of thePersonality of Godhead. Actually, Lord Kåñëa is everyone's friend andwell-wisher, but because we rebel against Him, He chastises us, and thus wemay perceive Him as threatening. Kåñëa, or God, is actually merciful, and when He punishes us, that is also His mercy.</div>
<div class="First">Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Öhäkura quotes the following Vedicstatement: raso vai saù rasaà hy eväyaà labdhvänandé bhavati. "He Himself israsa, the taste or mellow of a particular relationship. And certainly one whoachieves this rasa becomes änandé, filled with bliss." (Taittiréya Upaniñad 2.7.1)Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté quotes a further verse to explain the word rasa:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">vyatétya bhävanä-vartma</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yaç camatkära-bhära-bhüù</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">hådi sattvojjvale bäòhaà</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">svadate sa raso mataù</div>
<div class="First">"That which is beyond imagination, heavy with wonder and relished in the heart shining with goodness—such is known as rasa."</div>
<div class="First">As Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé elaborately explains in his Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu,there are five main rasas—neutrality, servitude, friendship, parental love andconjugal love—and seven secondary rasas—amazement, humor, chivalry,compassion, fury, fear and dread. Thus altogether there are twelve rasas, andthe supreme object of them all is Çré Kåñëa Himself. In other words, our loveand affection are actually meant for Çré Kåñëa. Unfortunately, out ofignorance we stubbornly try to squeeze happiness and love out of materialrelationships, which are not directly connected to Kåñëa, and thus life becomesa constant frustration.

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda to the Tenth Canto, Forty-third Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Kåñëa Kills the Elephant Kuvalayäpéòa."</div>
<div class="Chapnum">44. The Killing of Kaàsa</div>
<div class="First">This chapter tells how Kåñëa and Balaräma killed the wrestlers, how Kåñëakilled Kaàsa and consoled Kaàsa's wives, and how the two Lords were reunited with Their mother and father.</div>
<div class="First">Deciding to wrestle, Lord Kåñëa faced off against Cäëüra, and LordBaladeva took on Muñöika. Battling arm to arm, head to head, knee to kneeand chest to chest, the opponents attacked each other so fiercely that theyappeared to be harming even their own bodies. The ladies in the arena, seeingthe violent battle, began to condemn the King and all the members of theassembly: "A respectable audience should never have allowed a wrestlingmatch between such huge wrestlers, whose limbs are as tough as lightningbolts, and such tender young boys, who are just entering youth. An intelligentperson should never enter an assembly if he sees injustice being done there."Because Vasudeva and Devaké did not fully understand the power of Kåñëaand Balaräma, they became extremely unhappy when they heard the women of the audience speak these words.</div>
<div class="First">Çré Kåñëa then grabbed Cäëüra's arms, whirled him around several timesand threw him to the ground, killing him. Muñöika met a similar fate: afterbeing struck powerfully by Lord Baladeva's palm, he began vomiting blood andthen fell down dead. Thereupon the wrestlers named Küöa, Çala and Toçalacame forward, but Kåñëa and Balaräma easily killed them with the blows ofTheir fists and feet. The remaining wrestlers, fearing for their lives, all fled.Except for Kaàsa, everyone present cheered Kåñëa and Balaräma. TheKing, in a rage, stopped the festive music and ordered that Vasudeva, Nanda,Ugrasena and all the cowherds be severely punished and that Kåñëa andBalaräma be driven from the assembly. Kåñëa became furious when He heardKaàsa speak this way, and He instantly leapt onto the lofty royal dais. Hegrabbed Kaàsa by the hair, hurled him down onto the floor of the wrestlingring and threw Himself on top of him. In this way, Kaàsa met his death.Because out of fear Kaàsa had always thought of Kåñëa, after his death hegained the liberation of having a form like the Lord's.Kaàsa's eight brothers then attacked Kåñëa, but Balaräma easily killed eachof them with His club, just as a lion kills defenseless animals. Kettledrumsresounded in the sky as the joyful demigods rained down flowers and chanted the glories of Lord Kåñëa and Lord Balaräma.</div>
<div class="First">The wives of Kaàsa, grieving for their husband, lamented that he had diedbecause of his violence toward other living beings and his lack of respect forKåñëa, the Supreme Soul, who creates, maintains and destroys the entireuniverse. The Lord consoled the widows, had the funeral rites performed forKaàsa and his brothers and then released His mother and father frombondage. Kåñëa offered obeisances at His parents' feet, but they, nowunderstanding Him to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead, did not embrace Him.</div>
