Since by chanting the name of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, V&#257;sudeva, one can achieve all the good results of charity, austerity and penances, it is to be understood that by the chanting of this mantra, <span class="Italic">o&#7745; namo bhagavate v&#257;sudev&#257;ya,</span> the author or the speaker or any one of the readers of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is offering respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Lord, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the reservoir of all pleasure. In the First Canto of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> the principles of creation are described, and thus the First Canto may be called "Creation."</div><A NAME="22598"></A><div class="Purport">Similarly, in the Second Canto, the post-creation cosmic manifestation is described. The different planetary systems are described in the Second Canto as different parts of the universal body of the Lord. For this reason, the Second Canto may be called "The Cosmic Manifestation." There are ten chapters in the Second Canto, and in these ten chapters the purpose of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> and the different symptoms of this purpose are narrated. The first chapter describes the glories of chanting, and it hints at the process by which the neophyte devotees may perform meditation on the universal form of the Lord. In the first verse, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; replies to the questions of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, who asked him about one's duties at the point of death. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was glad to receive &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, and he was proud of being a descendant of Arjuna, the intimate friend of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Personally, he was very humble and meek, but he expressed his gladness that Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was very kind to his grandfathers, the sons of P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u, especially his own grandfather, Arjuna. And because Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was always pleased with Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it's family, at the verge of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it's death &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was sent to help him in the process of self-realization. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was a devotee of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a from his childhood, so he had natural affection for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; could understand his devotion. Therefore, he welcomed the questions about the King's duty. Because the King hinted that worship of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the ultimate function of every living entity, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; welcomed the suggestion and said, "Because you have raised questions about K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, your question is most glorious."

The answer to this question is the prime subject matter for hearing, and it is approved by all transcendentalists.</div><A NAME="22612"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="22613"></A><div class="First">Even the very question is so nice that it is the best subject matter for hearing. Simply by such questioning and hearing, one can achieve the highest perfectional stage of life. Because Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the original Supreme Person, any question about Him is original and perfect. Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu said that the highest perfection of life is to achieve the transcendental loving service of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Because questions and answers about K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a elevate one to that transcendental position, the questions of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it about K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a philosophy are greatly glorified. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it wanted to absorb his mind completely in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and such absorption can be effected simply by hearing about the uncommon activities of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. For instance, in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is stated that simply by understanding the transcendental nature of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's appearance, disappearance, and activities, one can immediately return home, back to Godhead, and never come back to this miserable condition of material existence. It is very auspicious, therefore, to hear always about K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. So Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it requested &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; to narrate the activities of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a so that he could engage his mind in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The activities of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a are nondifferent from K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself. As long as one is engaged in hearing such transcendental activities of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, he remains aloof from the conditional life of material existence. The topics of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a are so auspicious that they purify the speaker, the hearer and the inquirer. They are compared to the Ganges waters, which flow from the toe of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Wherever the Ganges waters go, they purify the land and the person who bathes in them. Similarly, <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-kath&#257;,</span> or the topics of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, are so pure that wherever they are spoken, the place, the hearer, the inquirer, the speaker and all concerned become purified.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

One is <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha,</span> and the other is <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hamedh&#299;.</span> The <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hasthas</span> are those who live together with wife and children but live transcendentally for realizing the ultimate truth. The <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hamedh&#299;s,</span> however, are those who live only for the benefit of the family members, extended or centralized, and thus are envious of others. The word <span class="Italic">medh&#299;</span> indicates jealousy of others. The <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hamedh&#299;s,</span> being interested in family affairs only, are certainly envious of others. Therefore, one <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hamedh&#299;</span> is not on good terms with another <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hamedh&#299;,</span> and in the extended form, one community, society or nation is not on good terms with another counterpart of selfish interest. In the age of Kali, all the householders are jealous of one another because they are blind to the knowledge of ultimate truth. They have many subject matters for hearing-political, scientific, social, economic and so on-but due to a poor fund of knowledge, they set aside the question of the ultimate miseries of life, namely miseries of birth, death, old age and disease. Factually, the human life is meant for making an ultimate solution to birth, death, old age and disease, but the <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hamedh&#299;s,</span> being illusioned by the material nature, forget everything about self-realization. The ultimate solution to the problems of life is to go back home, back to Godhead, and thus, as stated in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexa520.html?g=2877">8.16</a>), the miseries of material existence-birth, death, old age and disease-are removed.</div><A NAME="22628"></A><div class="Purport">The process of going back home, back to Godhead, is to hear about the Supreme Lord and His name, form, attributes, pastimes, paraphernalia and variegatedness. Foolish people do not know this. They want to hear something about the name, form, etc., of everything temporary, and they do not know how to utilize this propensity of hearing for the ultimate good. Misguided as they are, they also create some false literatures about the name, form, attributes, etc., of the ultimate truth. One should not, therefore, become a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hamedh&#299;</span> simply to exist for envying others; one should become a real householder in terms of the scriptural injunctions.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Every living being, beginning from Brahm&#257;, whose duration of life is some thousands of millions of years, down to the germs who live for a few seconds only, is struggling for existence. Therefore, this life is a sort of fight with material nature, which imposes death upon all. In the human form of life, a living being is competent enough to come to an understanding of this great struggle for existence, but being too attached to family members, society, country, etc., he wants to win over the invincible material nature by the aid of bodily strength, children, wife, relatives, etc. Although he is sufficiently experienced in the matter by dint of past experience and previous examples of his deceased predecessors, he does not see that the so-called fighting soldiers like the children, relatives, society members and countrymen are all fallible in the great struggle. One should examine the fact that his father or his father's father has already died, and that he himself is therefore also sure to die, and similarly, his children, who are the would be fathers of their children, will also die in due course. No one will survive in this struggle with material nature. The history of human society definitely proves it, yet the foolish people still suggest that in the future they will be able to live perpetually, with the help of material science. This poor fund of knowledge exhibited by human society is certainly misleading, and it is all due to ignoring the constitution of the living soul. This material world exists only as a dream, due to our attachment to it. Otherwise, the living soul is always different from the material nature. The great ocean of material nature is tossing with the waves of time, and the so-called living conditions are something like foaming bubbles, which appear before us as bodily self, wife, children, society, countrymen, etc. Due to a lack of knowledge of self, we become victimized by the force of ignorance and thus spoil the valuable energy of human life in a vain search after permanent living conditions, which are impossible in this material world.</div><A NAME="22658"></A><div class="Purport">Our friends, relatives and so-called wives and children are not only fallible, but also bewildered by the outward glamor of material existence.

Being engaged in all these materialistic activities, the living soul entangles himself in the cycle of the law of fruitive actions. This entails the chain of birth and death in the 8,400,000 species of life: the aquatics, the vegetables, the reptiles, the birds, the beasts, the uncivilized man, and then again the human form, which is the chance for getting out of the cycle of fruitive action. Therefore, if one desires freedom from this vicious circle, then one must cease to act as a <span class="Italic">karm&#299;</span> or enjoyer of the results of one's own work, good or bad. One should not do anything, either good or bad, on his own account, but must execute everything on behalf of the Supreme Lord, the ultimate proprietor of everything that be. This process of doing work is recommended in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index0526.html?g=3228">9.27</a>) also, where instruction is given for working on the Lord's account. Therefore, one should first of all hear about the Lord. When one has perfectly and scrutinizingly heard, one must glorify His acts and deeds, and thus it will become possible to remember constantly the transcendental nature of the Lord. Hearing about and glorifying the Lord are identical with the transcendental nature of the Lord, and by so doing, one will be always in the association of the Lord. This brings freedom from all sorts of fear. The Lord is the Supersoul (Param&#257;tm&#257;) present in the hearts of all living beings, and thus by the above hearing and glorifying process, the Lord invites the association of all in His creation. This process of hearing about and glorifying the Lord is applicable for everyone, whoever he may be, and it will lead one to the ultimate success in everything in which one may be engaged by providence. There are many classes of human beings: the fruitive workers, the empiric philosophers, the mystic <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s,</span> and ultimately, the unalloyed devotees. For all of them, one and the same process is applicable for achieving the desired success. Everyone wants to be free from all kinds of fear, and everyone wants the fullest extent of happiness in life. The perfect process for achieving this, here and now, is recommended in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> which is uttered by such a great authority as &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;. By hearing about and glorifying the Lord, all a person's activities become molded into spiritual activities, and thus all conceptions of material miseries become completely vanquished.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

A neophyte, who is intended to be promoted to the spiritual plane, is guided by the spiritual master under regulative principles. He may be compared to a patient who is treated by various restrictions under medical jurisdiction. Generally, liberated souls also take pleasure in describing the transcendental activities. As mentioned above, since N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, Hari, the Personality of Godhead, is beyond the material creation, His form and attributes are not material. The topmost transcendentalists or the liberated souls realize Him by advanced experience of transcendental knowledge, and therefore they take pleasure in the discussion of the transcendental qualities of the Lord's pastimes. In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexe89d.html?g=1505">4.9</a>), the Personality of Godhead declares that His appearance and activities are all <span class="Italic">divyam,</span> or transcendental. The common man, who is under the spell of material energy, takes it for granted that the Lord is like one of us, and therefore he refuses to accept the transcendental nature of the Lord's form, name, etc. The topmost transcendentalist is not interested in anything material, and his taking interest in the matter of the Lord's activities is definite proof that the Lord is not like one of us in the material world. In the Vedic literatures also, it is confirmed that the Supreme Lord is one, but that He is engaged in His transcendental pastimes in the company of His unalloyed devotees and that simultaneously He is present as the Supersoul, an expansion of Baladeva, in the heart of all living entities. Therefore, the highest perfection of transcendental realization is to take pleasure in hearing and describing the transcendental qualities of the Lord and not in merging into His impersonal Brahman existence, for which the impersonalist monist aspires. Real transcendental pleasure is realized in the glorification of the transcendental Lord, and not in the feeling of being situated in His impersonal feature. But there are also others who are not the topmost transcendentalists but are in a lower status, and who do not take pleasure in describing the transcendental activities of the Lord. Rather, they discuss such activities of the Lord formally with the aim of merging into His existence.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

He cites from the example of his life that he himself was attracted by the transcendental activities of the Lord, and he studied <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> from his great father, &#346;r&#299; Dvaip&#257;yana Vy&#257;sadeva. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> or, for that matter, any other scientific literature, cannot be studied at home by one's own intellectual capacity. Medical books of anatomy or physiology are available in the market, but no one can become a qualified medical practitioner simply by reading such books at home. One has to be admitted to the medical college and study the books under the guidance of learned professors. Similarly, <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, the postgraduate study of the science of Godhead,</span> can only be learned by studying it at the feet of a realized soul like &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva. Although &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was a liberated soul from the very day of his birth, he still had to take lessons of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> from his great father, Vy&#257;sadeva, who compiled the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> under the instruction of another great soul, &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada Muni. Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu instructed a learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> to study <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> from a personal <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavata.</span> <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is based on the transcendental name, form, attributes, pastimes, entourage and variegatedness of the Supreme Person, and it is spoken by the incarnation of the Personality of Godhead, &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva. Pastimes of the Lord are executed in cooperation with His pure devotees, and consequently historical incidences are mentioned in this great literature because they are related to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. It is called <span class="Italic">brahma-sammitam</span> because it is the sound representative of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-like the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> is the sound incarnation of the Lord because it is spoken by the Supreme Lord, and <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the sound representative of the Lord because it was spoken by the incarnation of the Lord about the activities of the Lord. As stated in the beginning of this book, it is the essence of the Vedic desire tree and the natural commentation on the <span class="Italic">Brahma-s&#363;tras,</span> the topmost philosophical thesis on the subject matter of Brahman. Vy&#257;sadeva appeared at the end of Dv&#257;para-yuga as the son of Satyavat&#299;, and therefore the word <span class="Italic">dv&#257;para-&#257;dau,</span> or "the beginning of Dv&#257;para-yuga," in this context means just prior to the beginning of the Kali-yuga. The logic of this statement, according to &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;, is comparable to that of calling the upper portion of the tree the beginning. The root of the tree is the beginning of the tree, but in common knowledge the upper portion of the tree is first seen. In that way the end of the tree is accepted as its beginning.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

For advancement of material knowledge there is a need for personal ability and researching aptitude, but in the case of spiritual knowledge, all progress depends more or less on the mercy of the spiritual master. The spiritual master must be satisfied with the disciple; only then is knowledge automatically manifest before the student of spiritual science. The process should not, however, be misunderstood to be something like magical feats whereby the spiritual master acts like a magician and injects spiritual knowledge into his disciple, as if surcharging him with an electrical current. The bona fide spiritual master reasonably explains everything to the disciple on the authorities of Vedic wisdom. The disciple can receive such teachings not exactly intellectually, but by submissive inquiries and a service attitude. The idea is that both the spiritual master and the disciple must be bona fide. In this case, the spiritual master, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, is ready to recite exactly what he has learned from his great father &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva, and the disciple, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, is a great devotee of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. A devotee of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is he who believes sincerely that by becoming a devotee of the Lord one becomes fully equipped with everything spiritual. This teaching is imparted by the Lord Himself in the pages of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> in which it is clearly described that the Lord (&#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a) is everything, and that to surrender unto Him solely and wholly makes one the most perfectly pious man. This unflinching faith in Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a prepares one to become a student of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> and one who hears <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> from a devotee like &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; is sure to attain salvation at the end, as Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it did. The professional reciter of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> and the pseudo-devotees whose faith is based on one week's hearing are different from &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it. &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva explained <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> unto &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; from the very beginning of the <span class="Italic">janm&#257;dy asya</I> [SB </I><a href="index4dab.html?g=6120">1.1.1</a></I>]</span></I> verse, and so &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; also explained it to the King. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is described as the Mah&#257;puru&#7779;a in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (Canto Eleven) in His devotional feature as Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu is Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself in His devotional attitude, descended on earth to bestow special favors upon the fallen souls of this age of Kali.

There are different types of persons who desire to attain success in different varieties of pursuits. Generally the persons are materialists who desire to enjoy the fullest extent of material gratification. Next to them are the transcendentalists, who have attained perfect knowledge about the nature of material enjoyment and thus are aloof from such an illusory way of life. More or less, they are satisfied in themselves by self-realization. Above them are the devotees of the Lord, who neither aspire to enjoy the material world nor desire to get out of it. They are after the satisfaction of the Lord, &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. In other words, the devotees of the Lord do not want anything on their personal account. If the Lord desires, the devotees can accept all sorts of material facilities, and if the Lord does not desire this, the devotees can leave aside all sorts of facilities, even up to the limit of salvation. Nor are they self-satisfied, because they want the satisfaction of the Lord only. In this verse, &#346;r&#299; &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; recommends the transcendental chanting of the holy name of the Lord. By offenseless chanting and hearing of the holy name of the Lord, one becomes acquainted with the transcendental form of the Lord, and then with the attributes of the Lord, and then with the transcendental nature of His pastimes, etc. Here it is mentioned that one should constantly chant the holy name of the Lord after hearing it from authorities. This means that hearing from the authorities is the first essential. Hearing of the holy name gradually promotes one to the stage of hearing about His form, about His attributes, His pastimes and so on, and thus the necessity of the chanting of His glories develops successively. This process is recommended not only for the successful execution of devotional service, but also even for those who are materially attached. According to &#346;r&#299; &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, this way of attaining success is an established fact, concluded not only by him, but also by all other previous <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas.</span> Therefore, there is no need of further evidence. The process is recommended not only for the progressive students in different departments of ideological success, but also for those who are already successful in their achievement as fruitive workers, as philosophers or as devotees of the Lord.</div><A NAME="22762"></A><div class="Purport"><JD:"Destination-309">&#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; instructs that chanting of the holy name of the Lord should be loudly done, and it should be performed offenselessly as well, as recommended in the <span class="Italic">Padma Pur&#257;&#7751;a.</span> One can deliver himself from the effects of all sins by surrendering himself unto the Lord. One can deliver himself from all offenses at the feet of the Lord by taking shelter of His holy name. But one cannot protect himself if one commits an offense at the feet of the holy name of the Lord. Such offenses are mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Padma Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> as being ten in number. The first offense is to vilify the great devotees who have preached about the glories of the Lord. The second offense is to see the holy names of the Lord in terms of worldly distinction. The Lord is the proprietor of all the universes, and therefore He may be known in different places by different names, but that does not in any way qualify the fullness of the Lord. Any nomenclature which is meant for the Supreme Lord is as holy as the others because they are all meant for the Lord. Such holy names are as powerful as the Lord, and there is no bar for anyone in any part of the creation to chant and glorify the Lord by the particular name of the Lord as it is locally understood. They are all auspicious, and one should not distinguish such names of the Lord as material commodities. The third offense is to neglect the orders of the authorized <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> or spiritual masters. The fourth offense is to vilify scriptures or Vedic knowledge. The fifth offense is to define the holy name of the Lord in terms of one's mundane calculation. The holy name of the Lord is identical with the Lord Himself, and one should understand the holy name of the Lord to be nondifferent from Him. The sixth offense is to interpret the holy name. The Lord is not imaginary, nor is His holy name. There are persons with a poor fund of knowledge who think the Lord to be an imagination of the worshiper and therefore think His holy name to be imaginary. Such a chanter of the name of the Lord cannot achieve the desired success in the matter of chanting the holy name. The seventh offense is to commit sins intentionally on the strength of the holy name. In the scriptures it is said that one can be liberated from the effects of all sinful actions simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord. One who takes advantage of this transcendental method and continues to commit sins on the expectation of neutralizing the effects of sins by chanting the holy name of the Lord is the greatest offender at the feet of the holy name. Such an offender cannot purify himself by any recommended method of purification. In other words, one may be a sinful man before chanting the holy name of the Lord, but after taking shelter in the holy name of the Lord and becoming immune, one should strictly restrain oneself from committing sinful acts with a hope that his method of chanting the holy name will give him protection. The eighth offense is to consider the holy name of the Lord and His chanting method to be equal to some material auspicious activity. There are various kinds of good works for material benefits, but the holy name and His chanting are not mere auspicious holy services. Undoubtedly the holy name is holy service, but He should never be utilized for such purposes. Since the holy name and the Lord are of one and the same identity, one should not try to bring the holy name into the service of mankind. The idea is that the Supreme Lord is the supreme enjoyer. He is no one's servant or order supplier. Similarly, since the holy name of the Lord is identical with the Lord, one should not try to utilize the holy name for one's personal service.</div><A NAME="22763"></A><div class="Purport">The ninth offense is to instruct those who are not interested in chanting the holy name of the Lord about the transcendental nature of the holy name, if such instruction is imparted to an unwilling audience, the act is considered to be an offense at the feet of the holy name. The tenth offense is to become uninterested in the holy name of the Lord even after hearing of the transcendental nature of the holy name. The effect of chanting the holy name of the Lord is perceived by the chanter as liberation from the conception of false egoism. False egoism is exhibited by thinking oneself to be the enjoyer of the world and thinking everything in the world to be meant for the enjoyment of one's self only. The whole materialistic world is moving under such false egoism of "I" and "mine," but the factual effect of chanting the holy name is to become free from such misconceptions.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

In order to encourage the King, who had only seven remaining days of life, &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; asserted that there is no use in living hundreds of years without any knowledge of the problems of life-better to live for a moment with full consciousness of the supreme interest to be fulfilled. The supreme interest of life is eternal, with full knowledge and bliss. Those who are bewildered by the external features of the material world and are engaged in the animal propensities of the eat-drink-and-be-merry type of life are simply wasting their lives by the unseen passing away of valuable years. We should know in perfect consciousness that human life is bestowed upon the conditioned soul to achieve spiritual success, and the easiest possible procedure to attain this end is to chant the holy name of the Lord. In the previous verse, we have discussed this point to a certain extent, and we may further be enlightened on the different types of offenses committed unto the feet of the holy name. &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; Prabhu has quoted many passages from authentic scriptures and has ably supported the statements in the matter of offenses at the feet of the holy name. From <span class="Italic">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u-y&#257;mala Tantra,</span> &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; has proven that one can be liberated from the effects of all sins simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord. Quoting from the <span class="Italic">M&#257;rka&#7751;&#7693;eya Pur&#257;&#7751;a,</span> &#346;r&#299; Gosv&#257;m&#299;j&#299; says that one should neither blaspheme the devotee of the Lord nor indulge in hearing others who are engaged in belittling a devotee of the Lord. A devotee should try to restrict the vilifier by cutting out his tongue, and being unable to do so, one should commit suicide rather than hear the blaspheming of the devotee of the Lord. The conclusion is that one should neither hear nor allow vilification of a devotee of the Lord. As far as distinguishing the Lord's holy name from the names of the demigods, the revealed scriptures disclose (Bg. <a href="index8205.html?g=3654">10.41</a>) that all extraordinarily powerful beings are but parts and parcels of the supreme energetic, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Except for the Lord Himself, everyone is subordinate; no one is independent of the Lord. Since no one is more powerful than or equal to the energy of the Supreme Lord, no one's name can be as powerful as that of the Lord. By chanting the Lord's holy name, one can derive all the stipulated energy synchronized from all sources. Therefore, one should not equalize the supreme holy name of the Lord with any other name. Brahm&#257;, &#346;iva or any other powerful god can never be equal to the Supreme Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. The powerful holy name of the Lord can certainly deliver one from sinful effects, but one who desires to utilize this transcendental potency of the holy name of the Lord in one's sinister activities is the most degraded person in the world. Such persons are never excused by the Lord or by any agent of the Lord. One should, therefore, utilize one's life in glorifying the Lord by all means, without any offense. Such activity of life, even for a moment, is never to be compared to a prolonged life of ignorance, like the lives of the tree and other living entities who may live for thousands of years without prosecuting spiritual advancement.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The activities to meet the immediate necessities of material life are not everything. One should always be alert in his duty for attainment of the best situation in the next life. Human life is meant for preparing ourselves for that prime duty. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Kha&#7789;v&#257;&#7749;ga is mentioned herein as a saintly king because even within the responsibility of the state management, he was not at all forgetful of the prime duty of life. Such was the case with other <span class="Italic">r&#257;jar&#7779;is</span> (saintly kings), like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it. They were all exemplary personalities on account of their being alert in discharging their prime duty. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Kha&#7789;v&#257;&#7749;ga was invited by the demigods in the higher planets to fight demons, and as a king he fought the battles to the full satisfaction of the demigods. The demigods, being fully satisfied with him, wanted to give him some benediction for material enjoyment, but Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Kha&#7789;v&#257;&#7749;ga, being very much alert to his prime duty, inquired from the demigods about his remaining duration of life. This means that he was not as anxious to accumulate some material benediction from the demigods as he was to prepare himself for the next life. He was informed by the demigods, however, that his life would last only a moment longer. The king at once left the heavenly kingdom, which is always full of material enjoyment of the highest standard, and coming down to this earth, took ultimate shelter of the all-safe Personality of Godhead. He was successful in his great attempt and achieved liberation. This attempt, even for a moment, by the saintly king, was successful because he was always alert to his prime duty. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was thus encouraged by the great &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, even though he had only seven days left in his life to execute the prime duty of hearing the glories of the Lord in the form of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> By the will of the Lord, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it instantly met the great &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, and thus the great treasure of spiritual success left by him is nicely mentioned in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span></div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

But one must cut off all attachment to the material body and everything pertaining to it and all desires thereof.</div><A NAME="22818"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="22819"></A><div class="First">The foolishness of gross materialism is that people think of making a permanent settlement in this world, although it is a settled fact that one has to give up everything here that has been created by valuable human energy. Great statesmen, scientists, philosophers, etc., who are foolish, without any information of the spirit soul, think that this life of a few years only is all in all and that there is nothing more after death. This poor fund of knowledge, even in the so-called learned circles of the world, is killing the vitality of human energy, and the awful result is being keenly felt. And yet the foolish materialistic men do not care about what is going to happen in the next life. The preliminary instruction in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> is that one should know that the identity of the individual living entity is not lost even after the end of this present body, which is nothing but an outward dress only. As one changes an old garment, so the individual living being also changes his body, and this change of body is called death. Death is therefore a process of changing the body at the end of the duration of the present life. An intelligent person must be prepared for this and must try to have the best type of body in the next life. The best type of body is a spiritual body, which is obtained by those who go back to the kingdom of God or enter the realm of Brahman. In the second chapter of this canto, this matter will be broadly discussed, but as far as the change of body is concerned, one must prepare now for the next life. Foolish people attach more importance to the present temporary life, and thus the foolish leaders make appeals to the body and the bodily relations. The bodily relations extend not only to this body but also to the family members, wife, children, society, country and so many other things which end at the end of life. After death one forgets everything about the present bodily relations; we have a little experience of this at night when we go to sleep. While sleeping, we forget everything about this body and bodily relations, although this forgetfulness is a temporary situation for only a few hours. Death is nothing but sleeping for a few months in order to develop another term of bodily encagement, which we are awarded by the law of nature according to our aspiration. Therefore, one has only to change the aspiration during the course of this present body, and for this there is need of training in the current duration of human life. This training can be begun at any stage of life, or even a few seconds before death, but the usual procedure is for one to get the training from very early life, from the stage of <span class="Italic">brahmacarya,</span> and gradually progress to the <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha,</span> <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha</span> and <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> orders of life. The institution which gives such training is called <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma,</span> or the system of <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana-dharma,</span> the best procedure for making the human life perfect. One is therefore required to give up the attachment to family or social or political life just at the age of fifty years, if not earlier, and the training in the <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha</span> and <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa-&#257;&#347;ramas</span> is given for preparation of the next life. Foolish materialists, in the garb of leaders of the people in general, stick to family affairs without attempting to cut off relations with them, and thus they become victims of nature's law and get gross bodies again, according to their work. Such foolish leaders may have some respect from the people at the end of life, but that does not mean that such leaders will be immune to the natural laws under which everyone is tightly bound by the hands and feet. The best thing is, therefore, that everyone voluntarily give up family relations by transferring attachment from family, society, country, and everything thereof to the devotional service of the Lord. It is stated herein that one should give up all desires of family attachment. One must have a chance for better desires; otherwise there is no chance of giving up such morbid desires. Desire is the concomitant factor of the living entity. The living entity is eternal, and therefore his desires, which are natural for a living being, are also eternal. One cannot, therefore, stop desiring, but the subject matter for desires can be changed. So one must develop the desires for returning back home, back to Godhead, and automatically the desires for material gain, material honor and material popularity will diminish in proportion to the development of devotional service. A living being is meant for service activities, and his desires are centered around such a service attitude. Beginning from the top executive head of the state down to the insignificant pauper in the street, all are rendering some sort of service to others. The perfection of such a service attitude is only attained simply by transferring the desire of service from matter to spirit, or from Satan to God.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The system of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma,</span> or <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana-dharma,</span> prescribes retirement from family encumbrances as early as possible after one has passed fifty years of age. Modern civilization is based on family comforts, the highest standard of amenities, and therefore after retirement everyone expects to live a very comfortable life in a well-furnished home decorated with fine ladies and children, without any desire to get out of such a comfortable home. High government officers and ministers stick to their prize posts until death, and they neither dream nor desire to get out of homely comforts. Bound by such hallucinations, materialistic men prepare various plans for a still more comfortable life, but suddenly cruel death comes without mercy and takes away the great planmaker against his desire, forcing him to give up the present body for another body. Such a planmaker is thus forced to accept another body in one of the 8,400,000 species of life according to the fruits of the work he has performed. In the next life, persons who are too much attached to family comforts are generally awarded lower species of life on account of sinful acts performed during a long duration of sinful life, and thus all the energy of the human life is spoiled. In order to be saved from the danger of spoiling the human form of life and being attached to unreal things, one must take warning of death at the age of fifty, if not earlier. The principle is that one should take it for granted that the death warning is already there, even prior to the attainment of fifty years of age, and thus at any stage of life one should prepare himself for a better next life. The system of the <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana-dharma</span> institution is so made that the follower is trained for the better next life without any chance that the human life will be spoiled. The holy places all over the world are meant for the residential purposes of retired persons getting ready for a better next life. Intelligent persons must go there at the end of life, and for that matter, after fifty years of age, to live a life of spiritual regeneration for the sake of being freed from family attachment, which is considered to he the shackle of material life. One is recommended to quit home just to get rid of material attachment because one who sticks to family life until death cannot get rid of material attachment and as long as one is materially attached one cannot understand spiritual freedom. One should not, however, become self-complacent simply by leaving home or by creating another home at the holy place, either lawfully or unlawfully. Many persons leave home and go to such holy places, but due to bad association, again become family men by illicit connection with the opposite sex. The illusory energy of matter is so strong that one is apt to be under such illusion at every stage of life, even after quitting one's happy home. Therefore, it is essential that one practice self-control by celibacy without the least desire for sex indulgence. For a man desiring to improve the condition of his existence, sex indulgence is considered suicidal, or even worse. Therefore, to live apart from family life means to become self-controlled in regard to all sense desires, especially sex desires. The method is that one should have a duly sanctified sitting place made of straw, deerskin and carpet, and thus sitting on it one should chant the holy name of the Lord without offense, as prescribed above. The whole process is to drag the mind from material engagements and fix it on the lotus feet of the Lord. This simple process alone will help one advance to the highest stage of spiritual success.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

This is the way of changing the habit of the mind. The mind is not to be killed. Mind or desire cannot be stopped, but to develop a desire to function for spiritual realization, the quality of engagement by the mind has to be changed. The mind is the pivot of the active sense organs, and as such if the quality of thinking, feeling and willing is changed, naturally the quality of actions by the instrumental senses will also change. <span class="Italic">O&#7745;k&#257;ra</span> is the seed of all transcendental sound and it is only the transcendental sound which can bring about the desired change of the mind and the senses. Even a mentally deranged man can be cured by treatment of transcendental sound. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> the <span class="Italic">pra&#7751;ava</span> (<span class="Italic">o&#7745;k&#257;ra</span>) has been accepted as the direct, literal representation of the Supreme Absolute Truth. One who is not able to chant directly the holy name of the Lord, as recommended above, can easily chant the <span class="Italic">pra&#7751;ava</span> (<span class="Italic">o&#7745;k&#257;ra</span>). This <span class="Italic">o&#7745;k&#257;ra</span> is a note of address, such as "O my Lord," just as <span class="Italic">o&#7745; hari om</span> means "O my Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead." As we have explained before, the Lord's holy name is identical with the Lord Himself. So also is <span class="Italic">o&#7745;k&#257;ra.</span> But persons who are unable to realize the transcendental personal form or name of the Lord on account of their imperfect senses (in other words, the neophytes) are trained to the practice of self-realization by this mechanical process of regulating the breathing function and simultaneously repeating the <span class="Italic">pra&#7751;ava</span> (<span class="Italic">o&#7745;k&#257;ra</span>) within the mind. As we have several times expressed, since the transcendental name, form, attributes, pastimes, etc., of the Personality of Godhead are impossible to understand with the present material senses, it is necessary that through the mind, the center of sensual activities, such transcendental realization be set into motion.

For example, the great mystic Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra Muni, even in the stage of <span class="Italic">samadhi,</span> became a victim of the senses and cohabited with Menak&#257;. History has already recorded this. The mind, although ceasing to think of sensual activities at present, remembers past sensual activities from the subconscious status and thus disturbs one from cent percent engagement in self-realization. Therefore, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; recommends the next step of assured policy, namely to fix one's mind in the service of the Personality of Godhead. Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, also recommends this direct process in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexfcdb.html?g=2458">6.47</a>).

Therefore, thinking of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u or meditating upon the transcendental form of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, specifically upon Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, is the last word on the subject of meditation. This meditation may be begun from the lotus feet of the Lord. One should not, however, forget or be misled from the complete form of the Lord; thus one should practice thinking of the different parts of His transcendental body, one after another. Here in this verse, it is definitely assured that the Supreme Lord is not impersonal. He is a person, but His body is different from those of conditioned persons like us. Otherwise, meditation beginning from the <span class="Italic">pra&#7751;ava</span> (<span class="Italic">o&#7745;k&#257;ra</span>) up to the limbs of the personal body of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u would not have been recommended by &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; for the attainment of complete spiritual perfection. The Vi&#7779;&#7751;u forms of worship in great temples of India are not, therefore, arrangements of idol worship, as they are wrongly interpreted to be by a class of men with a poor fund of knowledge; rather, they are different spiritual centers of meditation on the transcendental limbs of the body of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. The worshipable Deity in the temple of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is identical with Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u by the inconceivable potency of the Lord. Therefore, a neophyte's concentration or meditation upon the limbs of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u in the temple, as contemplated in the revealed scriptures, is an easy opportunity for meditation for persons who are unable to sit down tightly at one place and then concentrate upon <span class="Italic">pra&#7751;ava o&#7745;k&#257;ra</span> or the limbs of the body of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, as recommended herein by &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, the great authority. The common man can benefit more by meditating on the form of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u in the temple than on the <span class="Italic">o&#7745;k&#257;ra,</span> the spiritual combination of <span class="Italic">a-u-m</span> as explained before. There is no difference between <span class="Italic">o&#7745;k&#257;ra</span> and the forms of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, but persons unacquainted with the science of Absolute Truth try to create dissension by differentiating between the forms of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and that of <span class="Italic">o&#7745;k&#257;ra.</span> Here it is indicated that the Vi&#7779;&#7751;u form is the ultimate goal of meditation, and as such it is better to concentrate upon the forms of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u than on impersonal <span class="Italic">o&#7745;k&#257;ra.</span> The latter process is also more difficult than the former.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The nondevotee class of men cannot think of the personal feature of the Lord. Because of their poor fund of knowledge, the personal form of the Lord, like R&#257;ma or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, is completely revolting to them.

Unless such materialists are able to cleanse the materially absorbed mind, it is impossible for them to concentrate upon thoughts of transcendence. And to do so one may fix one's mind on the gross material or external feature of the Lord. The different parts of the gigantic form of the Lord are described in the following verses. The materialistic men are very anxious to have some mystic powers as a result of such a controlling process, but the real purpose of yogic regulations is to eradicate the accumulated dirty things like lust, anger, avarice and all such material contaminations. If the mystic <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> is diverted by the accompanying feats of mystic control, then his mission of yogic success is a failure, because the ultimate aim is God realization. He is therefore recommended to fix his gross materialistic mind by a different conception and thus realize the potency of the Lord.

He can see, hear, touch or manifest Himself anywhere and everywhere, for He is present everywhere as the Supersoul of all infinitesimal souls, although He has His particular abode in the absolute world. The relative world is also His phenomenal representation because it is nothing but an expansion of His transcendental energy. Although He is in His abode, His energy is distributed everywhere, just as the sun is localized as well as expanded everywhere, since the rays of the sun, being nondifferent from the sun, are accepted as expansions of the sun disc. In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Vi&#7779;&#7751;u Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span></B> (1.22.52) it is said that as fire expands its rays and heat from one place, similarly the Supreme Spirit, the Personality of Godhead, expands Himself by His manifold energy everywhere and anywhere. The phenomenal manifestation of the gigantic universe is only a part of His <span class="Italic">vir&#257;&#7789;</span> body. Less intelligent men cannot conceive of the transcendental all-spiritual form of the Lord, but they are astounded by His different energies, just as the aborigines are struck with wonder by the manifestation of lightning, a gigantic mountain or a hugely expanded banyan tree. The aborigines praise the strength of the tiger and the elephant because of their superior energy and strength. The <span class="Italic">asuras</span> cannot recognize the existence of the Lord, although there are vivid descriptions of the Lord in the revealed scriptures, although the Lord incarnates and exhibits His uncommon strength and energy, and although He is accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead by learned scholars and saints like Vy&#257;sadeva, N&#257;rada, Asita and Devala in the past and by Arjuna in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> as also by the <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> like &#346;a&#7749;kara, R&#257;m&#257;nuja, Madhva and Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya in the modern age. The <span class="Italic">asuras</span> do not accept any evidential proof from the revealed scriptures, nor do they recognize the authority of the great <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas.</span> They want to see with their own eyes at once. Therefore they can see the gigantic body of the Lord as <span class="Italic">vir&#257;&#7789;,</span> which will answer their challenge, and since they are accustomed to paying homage to superior material strength like that of the tiger, elephant and lightning, they can offer respect to the <span class="Italic">vir&#257;&#7789;-r&#363;pa.</span> Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, by the request of Arjuna, exhibited His <span class="Italic">vir&#257;&#7789;-r&#363;pa</span> for the <span class="Italic">asuras.</span> A pure devotee of the Lord, being unaccustomed to looking into such a mundane gigantic form of the Lord, requires special vision for the purpose. The Lord, therefore, favored Arjuna with special vision for looking into His <span class="Italic">vir&#257;&#7789;-r&#363;pa,</span> which is described in the Eleventh Chapter of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> This <span class="Italic">vir&#257;&#7789;-r&#363;pa</span> of the Lord was especially manifested, not for the benefit of Arjuna, but for that unintelligent class of men who accept anyone and everyone as an incarnation of the Lord and so mislead the general mass of people. For them, the indication is that one should ask the cheap incarnation to exhibit his <span class="Italic">vir&#257;&#7789;-r&#363;pa</span> and thus be established as an incarnation. The <span class="Italic">vir&#257;&#7789;-r&#363;pa</span> manifestation of the Lord is simultaneously a challenge to the atheist and a favor for the <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> who can think of the Lord as <span class="Italic">vir&#257;&#7789;</span> and thus gradually cleanse the dirty things from their hearts in order to become qualified to actually see the transcendental form of the Lord in the near future.

He is complete, and although innumerable complete forms emanate from Him, He is still complete, without any loss. That is His spiritual or internal potency. In the Eleventh Chapter of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> the Personality of Godhead, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, manifested His <span class="Italic">vir&#257;&#7789;-r&#363;pa</span> just to convince the less intelligent class of men, who cannot conceive of the Lord as appearing just like a human being, that He factually has the potency of His claim to be the Supreme Absolute person without any rival or superior. Materialistic men can think, although very imperfectly, of the huge universal space, comprehending an innumerable number of planets as big as the sun. They can see only the circular sky overhead, without any information that this universe, as well as many other hundreds of thousands of universes, are each covered by sevenfold material coverings of water, fire, air, sky, ego, noumenon and material nature, just like a huge football, pumped and covered, floating on the water of the Causal Ocean, wherein the Lord is lying as Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. All the universes in seed are emanating from the breathing of the Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, who is but part of a partial expansion of the Lord, and all the universes presided over by the Brahm&#257;s vanish when the Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u withdraws His great breath. In this way, the material worlds are being created and vanished by the supreme will of the Lord.

The conception of the universal form of the Lord gives a chance to the materialist to think of the Supreme Lord, but the materialist must know for certain that his visualization of the world in a spirit of lording over it is not God realization. The materialistic view of exploitation of the material resources is occasioned by the illusion of the external energy of the Lord, and as such, if anyone wants to realize the Supreme Truth by conceiving of the universal form of the Lord, he must cultivate the service attitude.

He moves with the progress of time, and therefore lie knows all about the past and future, along with His present activities. There is nothing unknown to Him.

As stated in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index89aa-2.html?g=2568">7.12</a>), the modes of nature act under His direction only, and as such no natural functions are blind or automatic. The power behind the activities is the supervision of the Lord, and thus the Lord is never inactive as is wrongly conceived. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> say that the Supreme Lord has nothing to do personally, as is always the case with superiors, but everything is done by His direction. As it is said, not a blade of grass moves without His sanction.

As such, sacrifice by every one of them in terms of pleasing the Supreme by feasible goods is recommended. Generally, the sacrifice is offered with clarified butter and grains, but with the progress of time, human society has produced varieties of goods by transforming materials supplied by God's material nature. Human society, therefore, <span class="Italic">must learn to offer sacrifices not only with clarified butter, but also with other manufactured goods in the propagation of the Lord's glory, and that will bring about perfection in human society.</span> The intelligent class of men, or <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> may give direction for such sacrifices in consultation with the previous <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas;</span> the administrators may give all facilities to perform such sacrifices; the <span class="Italic">vai&#347;ya</span> class or mercantile community, who produce such goods, may offer them for sacrifice; and the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> class may offer their manual labor for the successful termination of such sacrifice.

His appearance in the material world as one of us is also His causeless mercy upon the fallen souls. He is transcendental to all material conceptions, but by His unbounded mercy upon His pure devotees, He comes down and manifests Himself as the Personality of Godhead. Materialistic philosophers and scientists are too much engrossed with atomic energy and the gigantic situation of the universal form, and they offer respect more seriously to the external phenomenal feature of material manifestations than to the noumenal principle of spiritual existence. The transcendental form of the Lord is beyond the jurisdiction of such materialistic activities, and it is very difficult to conceive that the Lord can be simultaneously localized and all-pervasive, because the materialistic philosophers and scientists think of everything in terms of their own experience. Because they are unable to accept the personal feature of the Supreme Lord, the Lord is kind enough to demonstrate the <span class="Italic">vir&#257;&#7789;</span> feature of His transcendental form, and herein &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; has vividly described this form of the Lord. He concludes that there is nothing beyond this gigantic feature of the Lord. None of the materialistic thoughtful men can go beyond this conception of the gigantic form. The minds of the materialistic men are flickering and constantly changing from one aspect to another. Therefore, one is advised to think of the Lord by thinking of any part of His gigantic body, and by one's intelligence only one can think of Him in any manifestation of the material world-the forest, the hill, the ocean, the man, the animal, the demigod, the bird, the beast or anything else. Each and every item of the material manifestation entails a part of the body of the gigantic form, and thus the flickering mind can be fixed in the Lord only and nothing else. This process of concentrating on the different bodily parts of the Lord will gradually diminish the demoniac challenge of godlessness and bring about gradual development of devotional service to the Lord. Everything being a part and parcel of the Complete Whole, the neophyte student will gradually realize the hymns of <span class="Italic">&#298;&#347;opani&#7779;ad</span> which state that the Supreme Lord is everywhere, and thus he will learn the art of not committing any offense to the body of the Lord. This sense of God-mindedness will diminish one's pride in challenging the existence of God. Thus one can learn to show respect to everything, for all things are parts and parcels of the supreme body.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Otherwise one will be misled and will cause his own degradation.</div><A NAME="23157"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="23158"></A><div class="First">In this verse, the process of devotional service is indicated by the great Gosv&#257;m&#299;, &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva. He tries to impress upon us that instead of diverting our attention to several branches of self-realization, we should concentrate upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the supreme object of realization, worship and devotion. Self-realization is, as it were, offering a fight for eternal life against the material struggle for existence, and therefore by the illusory grace of the external energy, the <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> or the devotee is faced with many allurements which can entangle a great fighter again in the bondage of material existence. A <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> can attain miraculous successes in material achievements, such as <span class="Italic">a&#7751;im&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">laghim&#257;,</span> by which one can become more minute than the minutest or lighter than the lightest, or in the ordinary sense, one may achieve material benedictions in the shape of wealth and women. But one is warned against such allurements because entanglement again in such illusory pleasure means degradation of the self and further imprisonment in the material world. By this warning, one should follow one's vigilant intelligence only.</div><A NAME="23159"></A><div class="Purport">The Supreme Lord is one, and His expansions are various. He is therefore the Supersoul of everything. When a man sees anything, he must know that his seeing is secondary and the Lord's seeing is primary. One cannot see anything without the Lord's having first seen it. That is the instruction of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads.</span> So whatever we see or do, the Supersoul of all acts of seeing or doing is the Lord. This theory of simultaneous oneness and difference between the individual soul and the Supersoul is propounded by Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu as the philosophy of <span class="Italic">acintya-bhed&#257;bheda-tattva.</span> The <span class="Italic">vir&#257;&#7789;-r&#363;pa,</span> or the gigantic feature of the Supreme Lord, includes everything materially manifested, and therefore the <span class="Italic">vir&#257;&#7789;</span> or gigantic feature of the Lord is the Supersoul of all living and nonliving entities. But the <span class="Italic">vir&#257;&#7789;-r&#363;pa</span> is also the manifestation of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a or Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and going further on and on one will eventually see that Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the ultimate Supersoul of everything that be. The conclusion is that one should unhesitatingly become a worshiper of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, or, for that matter, His plenary expansion N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, and none else. In the Vedic hymns, it is clearly said that first of all N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a cast a glance over matter and thus there was creation. Before creation, there was neither Brahm&#257; nor &#346;iva, and what to speak of others. &#346;r&#299;p&#257;da &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya has definitely accepted this, that N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a is beyond the material creation and that all others are within the material creation. The whole material creation, therefore, is one with and different from N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, simultaneously, and this supports the <span class="Italic">acintya-bhed&#257;bheda-tattva</span> philosophy of Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. Being an emanation from the glancing potency of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, the whole material creation is nondifferent from Him. But because it is the effect of His external energy (<span class="Italic">bahira&#7749;g&#257; m&#257;y&#257;</span>) and is aloof from the internal potency (<span class="Italic">&#257;tma-m&#257;y&#257;</span>), the whole material creation is different from Him at the same time. The example given in this verse very nicely is that of the dreaming man. The dreaming man creates many things in his dream, and thus he himself becomes the entangled seer of the dream and is also affected by the consequences. This material creation is also exactly a dreamlike creation of the Lord, but He, being the transcendental Supersoul, is neither entangled nor affected by the reactions of such a dreamlike creation. He is always in His transcendental position, but essentially He is everything, and nothing is apart from Him. As a part of Him, one should therefore concentrate on Him only, without deviation; otherwise one is sure to be overcome by the potencies of the material creation, one after another.

Thus he was able to rebuild the creation as it was before.</div><A NAME="23180"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="23181"></A><div class="First">The example cited herein of &#346;r&#299; Brahm&#257;j&#299; is one of forgetfulness. Brahm&#257;j&#299; is the incarnation of one of the mundane attributes of the Lord. Being the incarnation of the passion mode of material nature, he is empowered by the Lord to generate the beautiful material manifestation. Yet due to his being one of the numerous living entities, he is apt to forget the art of his creative energy. This forgetfulness of the living being-beginning from Brahm&#257; down to the lowest insignificant ant-is a tendency which can be counteracted by meditation on the <span class="Italic">vir&#257;&#7789;-r&#363;pa</span> of the Lord. This chance is available in the human form of life, and if a human being follows the instruction of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> and begins to meditate upon the <span class="Italic">vir&#257;&#7789;-r&#363;pa,</span> then revival of his pure consciousness and counteraction of the tendency to forget his eternal relationship with the Lord can follow simultaneously. And as soon as this forgetfulness is removed, the <span class="Italic">vyavas&#257;ya-buddhi,</span> as mentioned here and in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexee5e.html?g=754">2.41</a>), follows at once. This ascertained knowledge of the living being leads to loving service to the Lord, which the living being requires. The kingdom of God is unlimited; therefore the number of the assisting hands of the Lord is also unlimited. The <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexfd2d.html?g=4405">13.14</a>) asserts that the Lord has His hands, legs, eyes and mouths in every nook and corner of His creation, This means that the expansions of differentiated parts and parcels, called <span class="Italic">j&#299;vas</span> or living entities, are assisting hands of the Lord, and all of them are meant for rendering a particular pattern of service to the Lord. The conditioned soul, even in the position of a Brahm&#257;, forgets this by the influence of illusory, material energy generated out of false egoism. One can counteract such false egoism by invoking God consciousness. Liberation means getting out of the slumber of forgetfulness and becoming situated in the real loving service of the Lord, as exemplified in the case of Brahm&#257;. The service of Brahm&#257; is the sample of service in liberation distinguished from the so-called altruistic services full of mistakes and forgetfulness. Liberation is never inaction, but service without human mistakes.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

He is not even satisfied with available amenities on this planet earth, where he has exploited the resources of nature to the best of his ability. He wants to go to the moon or the planet Venus to exploit resources there. But the Lord has warned us in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexa520.html?g=2877">8.16</a>) about the worthlessness of all the innumerable planets of this universe, as well as those planets within other systems. There are innumerable universes and also innumerable planets in each of them. But none of them is immune to the chief miseries of material existence, namely the pangs of birth, the pangs of death, the pangs of old age and the pangs of disease. The Lord says that even the topmost planet, known as the Brahmaloka or Satyaloka, (and what to speak of other planets, like the heavenly planets) is not a happy land for residential purposes, due to the presence of material pangs, as above mentioned. Conditioned souls are strictly under the laws of fruitive activities, and as such they sometimes go up to Brahmaloka and again come down to P&#257;t&#257;laloka, as if they were unintelligent children on a merry-go-round. The real happiness is in the kingdom of God, where no one has to undergo the pangs of material existence. Therefore, the Vedic ways of fruitive activities for the living entities are misleading. One thinks of a superior way of life in this country or that, or on this planet or another, but nowhere in the material world can he fulfill his real desire of life, namely eternal life, full intelligence and complete bliss. Indirectly, &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; affirms that Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, in the last stage of life, should not desire to transfer himself to the so-called heavenly planets, but should prepare himself for going back home, back to Godhead. None of the material planets, nor the amenities available there for living conditions, is everlasting; therefore one must have a factual reluctance to enjoy such temporary happiness as they afford.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The whole universe, or for that matter all material existence, is moving on as <span class="Italic">jagat,</span> simply for planning business to make one's position very comfortable or secure, although everyone sees that this existence is neither comfortable nor secure and can never become comfortable or secure at any stage of development. Those who are captivated by the illusory advancement of material civilization (following the way of phantasmagoria) are certainly madmen. The whole material creation is a <span class="Italic">jugglery of names</span> only; in fact, it is nothing but a bewildering creation of matter like earth, water and fire. The buildings, furniture, cars, bungalows, mills, factories, industries, peace, war or even the highest perfection of material science, namely atomic energy and electronics, are all simply bewildering names of material elements with their concomitant reactions of the three modes. Since the devotee of the Lord knows them perfectly well, he is not interested in creating unwanted things for a situation which is not at all reality, but simply names of no more significance than the babble of sea waves. The great kings, leaders and soldiers fight with one another in order to perpetuate their names in history. They are forgotten in due course of time, and they make a place for another era in history. But the devotee realizes how much history and historical persons are useless products of flickering time. The fruitive worker aspires after a big fortune in the matter of wealth, woman and worldly adoration, but those who are fixed in perfect reality are not at all interested in such false things. For them it is all a waste of time. Since every second of human life is important, an enlightened man should be very careful to utilize time very cautiously. One second of human life wasted in the vain research of planning for happiness in the material world can never be replaced, even if one spends millions of coins of gold. Therefore, the transcendentalist desiring freedom from the clutches of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> or the illusory activities of life, is warned herewith not to be captivated by the external features of fruitive actors. Human life is never meant for sense gratification, but for self-realization. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> instructs us solely on this subject from the very beginning to the end. Human life is simply meant for self-realization. The civilization which aims at this utmost perfection never indulges in creating unwanted things, and such a perfect civilization prepares men only to accept the bare necessities of life or to follow the principle of the best use of a bad bargain. Our material bodies and our lives in that connection are bad bargains because the living entity is actually spirit, and spiritual advancement of the living entity is absolutely necessary. Human life is intended for the realization of this important factor, and one should act accordingly, accepting only the bare necessities of life and depending more on God's gift without diversion of human energy for any other purpose, such as being mad for material enjoyment. The materialistic advancement of civilization is called "the civilization of the demons," which ultimately ends in wars and scarcity. The transcendentalist is specifically warned herewith to be fixed in mind, so that even if there is difficulty in plain living and high thinking he will not budge even an inch from his stark determination. For a transcendentalist, it is a suicidal policy to be intimately in touch with the sense gratifiers of the world, because such a policy will frustrate the ultimate gain of life. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; met Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it when the latter felt a necessity for such a meeting. It is the duty of a transcendentalist to help persons who desire real salvation and to support the cause of salvation. One might note that &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; never met Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it while he was ruling as a great king. For a transcendentalist, the mode of activities is explained in the next <span class="Italic">&#347;loka.</span></div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Human energy is spoiled in a vain search after such illusory happiness. If one is able to lie down on the floor, then why should one endeavor to get a good bedstead or soft cushion to lie on? If one can rest without any pillow and make use of the soft arms endowed by nature, there is no necessity of searching after a pillow. If we make a study of the general life of the animals, we can see that they have no intelligence for building big houses, furniture, and other household paraphernalia, and yet they maintain a healthy life by lying down on the open land. They do not know how to cook or prepare foodstuff, yet they still live healthy lives more easily than the human being. This does not mean that human civilization should revert to animal life or that the human being should live naked in the jungles without any culture, education and sense of morality. An intelligent human cannot live the life of an animal; rather, man should try to utilize his intelligence in arts and science, poetry and philosophy. In such a way he can further the progressive march of human civilization. But here the idea given by &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; is that the reserve energy of human life, which is far superior to that of animals, should simply he utilized for self-realization. Advancement of human civilization must be towards the goal of establishing our lost relationship with God, which is not possible in any form of life other than the human. One must realize the nullity of the material phenomenon, considering it a passing phantasmagoria, and must endeavor to make a solution to the miseries of life. Self-complacence with a polished type of animal civilization geared to sense gratification is delusion, and such a "civilization" is not worthy of the name. In pursuit of such false activities, a human being is in the clutches of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> or illusion. Great sages and saints in the days of yore were not living in palatial buildings furnished with good furniture and so-called amenities of life. They used to live in huts and groves and sit on the flat ground, and yet they have left immense treasures of high knowledge with all perfection. &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; and &#346;r&#299;la San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299; were high-ranking ministers of state, but they were able to leave behind them immense writings on transcendental knowledge, while residing only for one night underneath one tree. They did not live even two nights under the same tree, and what to speak of well-furnished rooms with modern amenities. And still they were able to give us most important literatures of self-realization. So-called comforts of life are not actually helpful for progressive civilization; rather, they are detrimental to such progressive life. In the system of <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana-dharma,</span> of four divisions of social life and four orders of progressive realization, there are ample opportunities and sufficient directions for a happy termination of the progressive life, and the sincere followers are advised therein to accept a voluntary life of renunciation in order to achieve the desired goal of life. If one is not accustomed to abiding by the life of renunciation and self-abnegation from the beginning, one should try to get into the habit at a later stage of life as recommended by &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, and that will help one to achieve the desired success.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Why then do the learned sages go to flatter those who are intoxicated by hard-earned wealth?</div><A NAME="23236"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="23237"></A><div class="First">The renounced order of life is never meant for begging or living at the cost of others as a parasite. According to the dictionary, a parasite is a sycophant who lives at the cost of society without making any contribution to that society. The renounced order is meant for contributing something substantial to society and not depending on the earnings of the householders. On the contrary, acceptance of alms from the householders by the bona fide mendicant is an opportunity afforded by the saint for the tangible benefit of the donor. In the <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana-dharma</span> institution, alms-giving to the mendicant is part of a householder's duty, and it is advised in the scriptures that the householders should treat the mendicants as their family children and should provide them with food, clothing, etc., without being asked. Pseudo-mendicants, therefore, should not take advantage of the charitable disposition of the faithful householders. The first duty of a person in the renounced order of life is to contribute some literary work for the benefit of the human being in order to give him realized direction toward self-realization. Amongst the other duties in the renounced order of life of &#346;r&#299;la San&#257;tana, &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa and the other Gosv&#257;m&#299;s of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, the foremost duty discharged by them was to hold learned discourses amongst themselves at Sev&#257;ku&ntilde;ja, V&#7771;nd&#257;vana (the spot where &#346;r&#299; R&#257;dh&#257;-D&#257;modara Temple was established by &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; and where the actual <span class="Italic">sam&#257;dhi</span> tombs of &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; and &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; are laid). For the benefit of all in human society, they left behind them immense literatures of transcendental importance. Similarly, all the <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> who voluntarily accepted the renounced order of life aimed at benefiting human society and not at living a comfortable or irresponsible life at the cost of others. However, those who cannot give any contribution should not go to the householders for food, for such mendicants asking bread from the householders are an insult to the highest order. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; gave this warning especially for those mendicants who adopt this line of profession to solve their economic problems. Such mendicants are in abundance in the age of Kali. When a man becomes a mendicant willfully or by circumstances, he must be of firm faith and conviction that the Supreme Lord is the maintainer of all living beings everywhere in the universe. Why, then, would He neglect the maintenance of a surrendered soul who is cent percent engaged in the service of the Lord? A common master looks to the necessities of his servant, so how much more would the all-powerful, all-opulent Supreme Lord look after the necessities of life for a fully surrendered soul. The general rule is that a mendicant devotee will accept a simple small loincloth without asking anyone to give it in charity. He simply salvages it from the rejected torn cloth thrown in the street. When he is hungry he may go to a magnanimous tree which drops fruits, and when he is thirsty he may drink water from the flowing river. He does not require to live in a comfortable house, but should find a cave in the hills and not be afraid of jungle animals, keeping faith in God, who lives in everyone's heart. The Lord may dictate to tigers and other jungle animals not to disturb His devotee. Harid&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura, a great devotee of Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya, used to live in such a cave, and by chance a great venomous snake was a co-partner of the cave. Some admirer of &#7788;h&#257;kura Harid&#257;sa who had to visit the &#7788;h&#257;kura every day feared the snake and suggested that the &#7788;h&#257;kura leave that place. Because his devotees were afraid of the snake and they were regularly visiting the cave, &#7788;h&#257;kura Harid&#257;sa agreed to the proposal on their account. But as soon as this was settled, the snake actually crawled out of its hole in the cave and left the cave for good before everyone present. By the dictation of the Lord, who lived also within the heart of the snake, the snake gave preference to Harid&#257;sa and decided to leave the place and not disturb him. So this is a tangible example of how the Lord gives protection to a bona fide devotee like &#7788;h&#257;kura Harid&#257;sa. According to the regulations of the <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana-dharma</span> institution, one is trained from the beginning to depend fully on the protection of the Lord in all circumstances. The path of renunciation is recommended for acceptance by one who is fully accomplished and fully purified in his existence. This stage is described also in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index1b44.html?g=5040">16.5</a>) as <span class="Italic">daiv&#299; sampat.</span> A human being is required to accumulate <span class="Italic">daiv&#299; sampat,</span> or spiritual assets; otherwise, the next alternative, <span class="Italic">&#257;sur&#299; sampat,</span> or material assets, will overcome him disproportionately, and thus one will be forced into the entanglement of different miseries of the material world. A <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> should always live alone, without company, and he must be fearless. He should never be afraid of living alone, although he is never alone. The Lord is residing in everyone's heart, and unless one is purified by the prescribed process, one will feel that he is alone. But a man in the renounced order of life must be purified by the process; thus he will feel the presence of the Lord everywhere and will have nothing to fear (such as being without any company). Everyone can become a fearless and honest person if his very existence is purified by discharging the prescribed duty for each and every order of life. One can become fixed in one's prescribed duty by faithful aural reception of Vedic instructions and assimilation of the essence of Vedic knowledge by devotional service to the Lord.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

As we have discussed many times before, this material world is itself an illusion, like a mirage in the desert. In the desert there is an illusion of water, and the foolish animals become entrapped by such an illusion and run after water in the desert, although there is no water at all. But because there is no water in the desert, one does not conclude that there is no water at all. The intelligent person knows well that there is certainly water, water in the seas and oceans, but such vast reservoirs of water are far, far away from the desert. One should therefore search for water in the vicinity of seas and oceans and not in the desert. Every one of us is searching after real happiness in life, namely eternal life, eternal or unlimited knowledge and unending blissful life. But foolish people who have no knowledge of the substance search after the reality of life in the illusion. This material body does not endure eternally, and everything in relation with this temporary body, such as the wife, children, society and country, also changes along with the change of body. This is called <span class="Italic">sa&#7745;s&#257;ra,</span> or repetition of birth, death, old age and disease. We would like to find a solution for all these problems of life, but we do not know the way. Herein it is suggested that anyone who wants to make an end to these miseries of life, namely repetition of birth, death, disease, and old age, must take to this process of worshiping the Supreme Lord and not others, as it is also ultimately suggested in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index673b.html?g=5988">18.65</a>). If we at all want to end the cause of our conditioned life, we must take to the worship of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who is present in everyone's heart by His natural affection for all living beings, who are actually the parts and parcels of the Lord (Bg. <a href="index0d72.html?g=5952">18.61</a>). The baby in the lap of his mother is naturally attached to the mother, and the mother is attached to the child. But when the child grows up and becomes overwhelmed by circumstances, he gradually becomes detached from the mother, although the mother always expects some sort of service from the grown-up child and is equally affectionate toward her child, even though the child is forgetful. Similarly, because we are all part and parcel of the Lord, the Lord is always affectionate to us, and He always tries to get us back home, back to Godhead. But we, the conditioned souls, do not care for Him and run instead after the illusory bodily connections. We must therefore extricate ourselves from all illusory connections of the world and seek reunion with the Lord, trying to render service unto Him because He is the ultimate truth. Actually we are hankering after Him as the child seeks the mother. And to search out the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we need not go anywhere else, because the Lord is within our hearts. This does not suggest, however, that we should not go to the places of worship, namely the temples, churches and mosques. Such holy places of worship are also occupied by the Lord because the Lord is omnipresent. For the common man these holy places are centers of learning about the science of God. When the temples are devoid of activities, the people in general become uninterested in such places, and consequently the mass of people gradually become godless, and a godless civilization is the result. Such a hellish civilization artificially increases the conditions of life, and existence becomes intolerable for everyone. The foolish leaders of a godless civilization try to devise various plans to bring about peace and prosperity in the godless world under a patent trademark of materialism, and because such attempts are illusory only, the people elect incompetent, blind leaders, one after another, who are incapable of offering solutions. If we want at all to end this anomaly of a godless civilization, we must follow the principles of revealed scriptures like the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> and follow the instruction of a person like &#346;r&#299; &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; who has no attraction for material gain.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The materialists, like animals, also do not know how they are being misdirected by neglecting the transcendental thought of the Supreme person. No one can remain vacant of thought. It is said that an idle brain is a devil's workshop because a person who cannot think in the right way must think of something which may bring about disaster. The materialists are always worshiping some minor demigods, although this is condemned in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexda67.html?g=2640">7.20</a>). As long as a person is illusioned by material gains, he petitions the respective demigods to draw some particular benefit which is, after all, illusory and nonpermanent. The enlightened transcendentalist is not captivated by such illusory things; therefore he is always absorbed in the transcendental thought of the Supreme in different stages of realization, namely Brahman, Param&#257;tm&#257; and Bhagav&#257;n. In the previous verse it is suggested that one should think of the Supersoul, which is one step higher than the impersonal thought of Brahman, as it was suggested in the case of contemplating the <span class="Italic">vir&#257;&#7789;-r&#363;pa</span> of the Personality of Godhead.</div><A NAME="23266"></A><div class="Purport">Intelligent persons who can see properly may look into the general conditions of the living entities who are wandering in the cycle of the 8,400,000 spieces of life, as well as in different classes of human beings. It is said that there is an everlasting belt of water called the River Vaitara&#7751;&#299; at the entrance of the plutonic planet of Yamar&#257;ja, who punishes sinners in different manners. After being subjected to such sufferings, a sinner is awarded a particular species of life according to his deeds in the past. Such living entities as are punished by Yamar&#257;ja are seen in different varieties of conditioned life. Some of them are in heaven, and some of them are in hell. Some of them are <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> and some of them are misers. But no one is happy in this material world, and all of them are either class A, B or C prisoners suffering because of their own deeds.

But the devotee, due to the Lord's personal service, progresses very easily. Impersonal meditation is therefore a source of suffering for the impersonalist. Here, the devotee has an advantage over the impersonalist philosopher. The impersonalist is doubtful about the personal feature of the Lord, and therefore he always tries to meditate upon something which is not objective. For this reason there is an authentic statement in the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> regarding the positive concentration of the mind on the factual form of the Lord.</div><A NAME="23335"></A><div class="Purport">The process of meditation recommended herein is <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> or the process of devotional service after one is liberated from the material conditions. <span class="Italic">J&ntilde;&#257;na-yoga</span> is the process of liberation from the material conditions. After one is liberated from the conditions of material existence, i.e., when one is <span class="Italic">niv&#7771;tta,</span> as previously stated herein, or when one is freed from all material necessities, one becomes qualified to discharge the process of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> Therefore <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> includes <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na-yoga,</span> or, in other words, the process of pure devotional service simultaneously serves the purpose of <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na-yoga;</span> liberation from material conditions is automatically achieved by the gradual development of pure devotional service. These effects of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> are called <span class="Italic">anartha-niv&#7771;tti.</span> Things which are artificially acquired gradually disappear along with the progress of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> Meditation on the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, the first processional step, must show its effect by <span class="Italic">anartha-niv&#7771;tti.</span> The grossest type of <span class="Italic">anartha</span> which binds the conditioned soul in material existence is sex desire, and this sex desire gradually develops in the union of the male and female. When the male and female are united, the sex desire is further aggravated by the accumulation of buildings, children, friends, relatives and wealth. When all these are acquired, the conditioned soul becomes overwhelmed by such entanglements, and the false sense of egoism, or the sense of "myself" and "mine," becomes prominent, and the sex desire expands to various political, social, altruistic, philanthropic and many other unwanted engagements, resembling the foam of the sea waves, which becomes very prominent at one time and at the next moment vanishes as quickly as a cloud in the sky. The conditioned soul is encircled by such products, as well as products of sex desire, and therefore <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> leads to gradual evaporation of the sex desire, which is summarized in three headings, namely <span class="Italic">profit, adoration</span> and <span class="Italic">distinction.</span> All conditioned souls are mad after these different forms of sex desire, and one shall see for himself how much he has been freed from such material hankerings based primarily on the sex desire. As a person feels his hunger satisfied after eating each morsel of foodstuff, he must similarly be able to see the degree to which he has been freed from sex desire. The sex desire is diminished along with its various forms by the process of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> because <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> automatically, by the grace of the Lord, effectively results in knowledge and renunciation, even if the devotee is not materially very well educated. Knowledge means knowing things as they are, and if by deliberation it is found that there are things which are at all unnecessary, naturally the person who has acquired knowledge leaves aside such unwanted things. When the conditioned soul finds by culture of knowledge that material necessities are unwanted things, he becomes detached from such unwanted things. This stage of knowledge is called <span class="Italic">vair&#257;gya,</span> or detachment from unwanted things. We have previously discussed that the transcendentalist is required to be self-sufficient and should not beg from the rich blind persons to fulfill the bare necessities of life. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; has suggested some alternatives for the bare necessities of life, namely the problem of eating, sleeping and shelter, but he has not suggested any alternative for sex satisfaction. One who has the sex desire still with him should not at all try to accept the renounced order of life. For one who has not attained to this stage, there is no question of a renounced order of life. So by the gradual process of devotional service under the guidance of a proper spiritual master, and following the principles of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> one must be able at least to control the gross sex desire before one accepts the renounced order of life factually.</div><A NAME="23336"></A><div class="Purport">So purification means getting free gradually from sex desire, and this is attained by meditation on the person of the Lord as described herein, beginning from the feet. One should not try to go upwards artificially without seeing for himself how much he has been released from the sex desire. The smiling face of the Lord is the Tenth Canto of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> and there are many upstarts who at once try to begin with the Tenth Canto and especially with the five chapters which delineate the <span class="Italic">r&#257;sa-l&#299;l&#257;</span> of the Lord. This is certainly improper. By such improper study or hearing of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> the material opportunists have played havoc by indulgence in sex life in the name of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> This vilification of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is rendered by the acts of the so-called devotees; one should be free from all kinds of sex desire before he tries to make a show of recital of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> &#346;r&#299; Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura clearly defines the import of purification as cessation from sex indulgence. He says, <span class="Italic">yath&#257; yath&#257; dh&#299;&#347; ca &#347;udhyati vi&#7779;aya-l&#257;mpa&#7789;ya&#7745; tyajati, tath&#257; tath&#257; dh&#257;rayed iti citta-&#347;uddhi-t&#257;ratamyenaiva dhy&#257;na-t&#257;ratamyam uktam.</span> And as one gets free from the intoxication of sex indulgence by purification of intelligence, one should step forward for the next meditation, or in other words, the progress of meditation on the different limbs of the transcendental body of the Lord should be enhanced in proportion to the progress of purification of the heart. The conclusion is that those who are still entrapped by sex indulgence should never progress to meditation above the feet of the Lord; therefore recital of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> by them should be restricted to the First and Second Cantos of the great literature. One must complete the purificatory process by assimilating the contents of the first nine cantos. Then one should be admitted into the realm of the Tenth Canto of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span></div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The spiritual world is the manifestation of His internal potency, and the material world is the manifestation of His external potency. The living entities are also His marginal potency, and by their own choice they can live in either the transcendental or material worlds. The material world is not a fit place for living entities because they are spiritually one with the Lord and in the material world the living entities become conditioned by the laws of the material world. The Lord wants all living entities, who are His parts and parcels, to live with Him in the transcendental world, and for enlightening conditioned souls in the material world, all the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and the revealed scriptures are there-expressly to recall the conditioned souls back home, back to Godhead. Unfortunately, the conditioned living entities, although suffering continually the threefold miseries of conditioned life, are not very serious about going back to Godhead. It is due to their misguided way of living, complicated by sins and virtues. Some of them who are virtuous by deeds begin to reestablish the lost relation with the Lord, but they are unable to understand the personal feature of the Lord. The real purpose of life is to make contact with the Lord and be engaged in His service. That is the natural position of living entities. But those who are impersonalists and are unable to render any loving service to the Lord have been advised to meditate upon His impersonal feature, the <span class="Italic">vir&#257;&#7789;-r&#363;pa,</span> or universal form. Some way or other, one must try to reestablish one's forgotten relation with the Lord if one at all desires to gain real happiness in life, and to reclaim his natural unfettered condition. For the less intelligent beginners, meditation on the impersonal feature, the <span class="Italic">vir&#257;&#7789;-r&#363;pa,</span> or universal form of the Lord, will gradually qualify one to rise to personal contact. One is advised herewith to meditate upon the <span class="Italic">vir&#257;&#7789;-r&#363;pa</span> specified in the previous chapters in order to understand how the different planets, seas, mountains, rivers, birds, beasts, human beings, demigods and all that we can conceive are but different parts and limbs of the Lord's <span class="Italic">vir&#257;&#7789;</span> form. This sort of thinking is also a type of meditation on the Absolute Truth, and as soon as such meditation begins, one develops one's godly qualities, and the whole world appears to be a happy and peaceful residence for all the people of the world. Without such meditation on God, either personal or impersonal, all good qualities of the human being become covered with misconceptions regarding his constitutional position, and without such advanced knowledge, the whole world becomes a hell for the human being.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

But these opportune moments are not as important as one's being a successful <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> who is able to quit his body as he likes. Such a <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> must be competent to control his senses by the mind. The mind is easily conquered simply by engaging it at the lotus feet of the Lord. Gradually, by such service, all the senses become automatically engaged in the service of the Lord.

When the mind is materialistic, or absorbed in material contact, it acts for material advancement of knowledge, destructively ending in discovery of nuclear weapons. But when the mind acts under spiritual urge, it acts wonderfully for going back home, back to Godhead, for life in complete bliss and eternity. Therefore the mind has to be manipulated by good and unalloyed intelligence. Perfect intelligence is to render service unto the Lord. One should be intelligent enough to understand that the living being is, in all circumstances, a servant of the circumstances. Every living being is serving the dictates of desire, anger, lust, illusion, insanity and enviousness-all materially affected. But even while executing such dictations of different temperaments, he is perpetually unhappy. When one actually feels this and turns his intelligence to inquiring about it from the right sources, he gets information of the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Instead of serving materially for the abovementioned different humors of the body, the living entity's intelligence then becomes freed from the unhappy illusion of materialistic temperament, and thus, by unalloyed intelligence, the mind is brought into the service of the Lord. The Lord and His service are identical, being on the absolute plane. Therefore the unalloyed intelligence and the mind are merged into the Lord, and thus the living entity does not remain a seer himself but becomes seen by the Lord transcendentally. When the living entity is directly seen by the Lord, the Lord dictates to him to act according to His desire, and when the living entity follows Him perfectly, the living entity ceases to discharge any other duty for his illusory satisfaction. In his pure unalloyed state, the living being attains the stage of full bliss, <span class="Italic">labdhopa&#347;&#257;nti,</span> and ceases all material hankerings.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The influence of time is exhibited by the symptoms of birth, death, old age and disease, and these four principles of material conditions are present everywhere in any part of the material cosmos up to the planet Brahmaloka, where the duration of life of the inhabitants appears to us to be fabulous. Insurmountable time even brings about the death of Brahm&#257;, so what to speak of other demigods like Indra, Candra, S&#363;rya, V&#257;yu and Varu&#7751;a? The astronomical influence directed by the different demigods over mundane creatures is also conspicuous by its absence. In material existence, the living entities are afraid of Satanic influence, but for a devotee on the transcendental plane there is no such fear at all. The living entities change their material bodies in different shapes and forms under the influence of the different modes of material nature, but in the transcendental state the devotee is <span class="Italic">gu&#7751;a-t&#299;ta,</span> or above the material modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. Thus the false ego of "I am the lord of all I survey" does not arise there. In the material world the false ego of the living being trying to lord it over the material nature is something like the moth's falling in a blazing fire. The moth is captivated by the glaring beauty of the fire, and when he comes to enjoy it, the blazing fire consumes him. In the transcendental state the living being is pure in his consciousness, and as such he has no false ego to lord it over the material nature. Rather, his pure consciousness directs him to surrender unto the Supreme Lord, as stated in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index4112.html?g=2631">7.19</a>): <span class="Italic">v&#257;sudeva&#7717; sarvam iti sa mah&#257;tm&#257; sudurlabha&#7717;.</span> All this indicates that in the transcendental state there is neither material creation nor the Causal Ocean for material nature.</div><A NAME="23410"></A><div class="Purport">The above-mentioned state of affairs is factual on the transcendental plane, but is factually revealed in a transcendentalist's knowledge of the advanced state of pure consciousness. Such transcendentalists are of two types, namely the impersonalists and the devotees. For the impersonalist the ultimate goal or destination is the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> of the spiritual sky, but for the devotees the ultimate goal is the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets. The devotees experience the above-mentioned state of affairs by attainment of spiritual forms for activity in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. But the impersonalist, because of his neglecting the association of the Lord, does not develop a spiritual body for spiritual activity, but remains a spiritual spark only, merged in the effulgent spiritual rays of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is the full-fledged form of eternity, bliss and knowledge, but the formless <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> is simply eternity and knowledge. The Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets are also forms of eternity, bliss and knowledge, and therefore the devotees of the Lord, who are admitted into the abode of the Lord, also get bodies of eternity, bliss and knowledge. As such there is no difference between one and another. The Lord's abode, name, fame, entourage, etc., are of the same transcendental quality, and how this transcendental quality differs from the material world is explained herewith in this verse. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> three principal subjects have been explained by Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, namely <span class="Italic">karma-yoga, j&ntilde;&#257;na-yoga</span> and <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> but one can reach the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets by the practice of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> only. The other two are incompetent in helping one reach the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;halokas, although they can, however, conveniently take one to the effulgent <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti,</span> as described above.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

In that sky, which is far, far beyond the material sky and its sevenfold coverings, there is no need of the sun or the moon, nor is there necessity of electricity for illumination, because the planets are self-illuminating and more brilliant than the material suns. pure devotees of the Lord are absolutely in harmony with the Personality of Godhead, or in other words, they always think of the Lord as their only dependable friend and well-wisher. They do not care for any mundane creature, up to the status of Brahm&#257;, the lord of the universe. Only they can definitely have a clear vision of the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets.

Nor do they concern themselves with many obscure speculative theories, which are in actuality so many stumbling blocks on the path of transcendental understanding. Apart from the class of impersonalists or nondevotees, there are also classes who pose themselves as devotees of the Lord but at heart maintain the idea of salvation by becoming one with the impersonal Brahman. They wrongly manufacture their own way of devotional service by open debauchery and mislead others who are simpletons or debauchees like themselves. All these nondevotees and debauchees are, according to Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299;, <span class="Italic">dur&#257;tm&#257;s,</span> or crooked souls in the dress of <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;s,</span> or great souls.

Material desires are based on the false ego of the living being and are exhibited by his childish and useless activities to conquer the laws of material nature and by his desire to lord it over the resources of the five elements. With such a mentality, one is led to believe in the strength of material science, with its discovery of atomic energy and space travel by mechanical vehicles, and by such tiny advancements in material science the false egoist tries to challenge even the strength of the Supreme Lord, who can finish all man's tiny endeavors in less than a second. The well-situated self, or Brahman-realized soul, perfectly understands that the Supreme Brahman, or the Personality of Godhead, is the all-powerful V&#257;sudeva and that he (the self-realized living being) is a part and parcel of the supreme whole.

The condition is that one should be completely freed from desire for material enjoyment. There are different grades of material enjoyments in respect to duration of life and sensual gratification. The highest plane of sensual enjoyment for the longest period of life is mentioned in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index3126.html?g=3165">9.20</a>). All are but material enjoyments, and one should be thoroughly convinced that he has no need of such a long duration of life, even in the Brahmaloka planet. He must return home, back to Godhead, and must not be attracted by any amount of material facilities. In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexa6fd.html?g=913">2.59</a>) it is said that this sort of material detachment is possible to attain when one is acquainted with the supreme association of life. <span class="Italic">Para&#7745; d&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;v&#257; nivartate.</span> One cannot be freed from material attraction unless he has complete understanding of the nature of spiritual life. The propaganda by a certain class of impersonalists that spiritual life is void of all varieties is dangerous propaganda to mislead the living beings into becoming more and more attracted by material enjoyments. As such, persons with a poor fund of knowledge cannot have any conception of the <span class="Italic">param,</span> the Supreme; they try to stick to the varieties of material enjoyments, although they may flatter themselves as being Brahman-realized souls. Such less intelligent persons cannot have any conception of the <span class="Italic">param,</span> as mentioned in this verse, and therefore they cannot reach the Supreme. The devotees have full knowledge of the spiritual world, the Personality of Godhead and His transcendental association in unlimited spiritual planets called Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;halokas. Herein <span class="Italic">aku&#7751;&#7789;ha-d&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;i&#7717;</span> is mentioned. <span class="Italic">Aku&#7751;&#7789;ha</span> and <span class="Italic">vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha</span> convey the same import, and only one who has his aim fixed upon that spiritual world and personal association with the Godhead can give up his material connections even while living in the material world. This <span class="Italic">param</span> and the <span class="Italic">para&#7745; dh&#257;ma</span> mentioned in several places in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> are one and the same thing. One who goes to the <span class="Italic">para&#7745; dh&#257;ma</span> does not return to the material world.

The <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> therefore blocks up all the above-mentioned seven openings, so that the life air will naturally burst forth through the cerebral hole.

The topmost planetary systems consist of planets like Brahmaloka and Dhruvaloka (the polestar), and all of them are situated beyond Maharloka. The inhabitants of those planets are empowered with eightfold achievements of mystic perfection. They do not have to learn and practice the mystic processes of <span class="Italic">yoga</span> perfection and achieve the power of becoming small like a particle (<span class="Italic">a&#7751;im&#257;-siddhi</span>), or lighter than a soft feather (<span class="Italic">laghim&#257;-siddhi</span>). They do not have to get anything and everything from anywhere and everywhere (<span class="Italic">pr&#257;pti-siddhi</span>), to become heavier than the heaviest (<span class="Italic">mahim&#257;-siddhi</span>), to act freely even to create something wonderful or to annihilate anything at will (<span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;itva-siddhi</span>), to control all material elements (<span class="Italic">va&#347;itva-siddhi</span>), to possess such power as will never be frustrated in any desire (<span class="Italic">pr&#257;k&#257;mya-siddhi</span>), or to assume any shape or form one may even whimsically desire (<span class="Italic">k&#257;m&#257;vas&#257;yit&#257;-siddhi</span>). All these expediencies are as common as natural gifts for the inhabitants of those higher planets. They do not require any mechanical help to travel in outer space, and they can move and travel at will from one planet to any other planet within no time. The inhabitants of the earth cannot move even to the nearest planet except by mechanical vehicles like spacecraft, but the highly talented inhabitants of such higher planets can do everything very easily.</div><A NAME="23484"></A><div class="Purport">Since a materialist is generally inquisitive to experience what is actually in such planetary systems, he wants to see everything personally. As inquisitive persons tour all over the world to gain direct local experience, the less intelligent transcendentalist similarly desires to have some experience of those planets about which he has heard so many wonderful things. The <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> can, however, easily fulfill his desire by going there with the present materialistic mind and senses. The prime inclination of the materialistic mind is to lord it over the material world, and all the <span class="Italic">siddhis</span> mentioned above are features of domination over the world. The devotees of the Lord are not ambitious to dominate a false and temporary phenomenon. On the contrary, a devotee wants to be dominated by the supreme predominator, the Lord. A desire to serve the Lord, the supreme predominator, is spiritual or transcendental, and one has to attain this purification of the mind and the senses to get admission into the spiritual kingdom. With the materialistic mind one can reach the best planet in the universe, but no one can enter into the kingdom of God. Senses are called spiritually purified when they are not involved in sense gratification. Senses require engagements, and when the senses are engaged totally in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, they have no chance to become contaminated by material infections.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

In the creation of the Lord there are many wonderful things we can see with our own eyes every day and night, but we are unable to reach them equipped by modern materialistic science. We should not, therefore, depend on the fragmentary authority of materialistic science for knowing things beyond the range of scientific purview. For a common man, both modern science and Vedic wisdom are simply to be accepted because none of the statements either of modern science or of Vedic literature can be verified by him. The alternative for a common man is to believe either of them or both of them.

Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a affirmed that the system of knowledge as explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> was explained to the sun-god, and the knowledge descended by disciplic succession from the sun-god to his son Manu, and from Manu to King Ik&#7779;v&#257;ku (the forefather of Lord R&#257;macandra), and thus the system of knowledge was explained down the line of great sages, one after another. But in due course of time the authorized succession was broken, and therefore, just to reestablish the true spirit of the knowledge, the Lord again explained the same knowledge to Arjuna, who was a bona fide candidate for understanding due to his being a pure devotee of the Lord. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> as it was understood by Arjuna, is also explained (Bg. <a href="index1ba6.html?g=3396">10.12</a>-13), but there are many foolish men who do not follow in the footsteps of Arjuna in understanding the spirit of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> They create instead their own interpretations, which are as foolish as they themselves, and thereby only help to put a stumbling block on the path of real understanding, misdirecting the innocent followers who are less intelligent, or the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras.</span> It is said that one should become a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> before one can understand the Vedic statements, and this stricture is as important as the stricture that no one shall become a lawyer who has not qualified himself as a graduate. Such a stricture is not an impediment in the path of progress for anyone and everyone, but it is necessary for an unqualified understanding of a particular science.

But materialistic men do not understand this. They want to make a plan to become happy in a place where there is no happiness. For false happiness they try to reach other planets, either by Vedic rituals or by spacecraft, but they should know for certain that any amount of materialistic adjustment for becoming happy in a place which is meant for distress cannot benefit the misguided man because, after all, the whole universe with all its paraphernalia will come to an end after a certain period. Then all plans of materialistic happiness will automatically come to an end. The intelligent person therefore makes a plan to return home, back to Godhead. Such an intelligent person surpasses all the pangs of material existence, like birth, death, disease and old age. He is actually happy because he has no anxieties of material existence, but as a compassionate sympathizer he feels unhappiness for the suffering materialistic men, and thus he occasionally comes before the materialistic men to teach them the necessity of going back to Godhead. All the bona fide <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> preach this truth of returning home, back to Godhead, and warn men not to make a false plan for happiness in a place where happiness is only a myth.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

A portion of the ego is the vibration of sound, and a portion of sound is atmospheric air. A portion of the airy atmosphere is turned into forms, and the forms constitute the power of electricity or heat. Heat produces the smell of the aroma of the earth, and the gross earth is produced by such aroma. And all these combined together constitute the cosmic phenomenon. The extent of the cosmic phenomenon is calculated to be diametrically (both ways) four billion miles. Then the coverings of the universe begin. The first stratum of the covering is calculated to extend eighty million miles, and the subsequent coverings of the universe are respectively of fire, effulgence, air and ether, one after another, each extending ten times further than the previous.

And in that status he merges the material modes of nature [ignorance and passion] in this point of neutralization and thus reaches egoism in goodness. After this, all egoism is merged in the mahat-tattva, and he comes to the point of pure self-realization.</div><A NAME="23596"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="23597"></A><div class="First">Pure self-realization, as we have several times discussed, is the pure consciousness of admitting oneself to be the eternal servitor of the Lord. Thus one is reinstated in his original position of transcendental loving service to the Lord, as will be clearly explained in the following verse. This stage of rendering transcendental loving service to the Lord without any hopes of emolument from the Lord, or any other way, can be attained when the material senses are purified and the original pure state of the senses is revived. It is suggested herein that the process of purifying the senses is by the yogic way, namely the gross senses are merged in the mode of ignorance, and the subtle senses are merged in the mode of passion. The mind belongs to the mode of goodness and therefore is called <span class="Italic">devamaya,</span> or godly. perfect purification of the mind is made possible when one is fixed in the conviction of being the eternal servitor of the Lord. Therefore simple attainment of goodness is also a material mode; one has to surpass this stage of material goodness and reach the point of purified goodness, or <span class="Italic">vasudeva-sattva.</span> This <span class="Italic">vasudeva-sattva</span> helps one to enter into the kingdom of God.</div><A NAME="23598"></A><div class="Purport">We may also remember in this connection that the process of gradual emancipation by the devotees in the manner mentioned above, although authoritative, is not viable in the present age because of people's being primarily unaware of <span class="Italic">yoga</span> practice. The so-called <span class="Italic">yoga</span> practice by the professional protagonists may be physiologically beneficial, but such small successes cannot help one in the attainment of spiritual emancipation as mentioned herein. Five thousand years ago, when the social status of human society was in perfect Vedic order, the <span class="Italic">yoga</span> process mentioned herein was a common affair for everyone because everyone, and especially the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya,</span> was trained in the transcendental art under the care of the spiritual master far away from home, in the status of <span class="Italic">brahmacarya.</span> Modern man, however, is incompetent to understand it perfectly.</div><A NAME="23599"></A><div class="Purport">Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya, therefore, made it easier for the prospective devotee of the present age in the following specific manner. Ultimately there is no difference in the result. The first and foremost point is that one must understand the prime importance of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> The living beings in different species of life are undergoing different terms of encagement according to their fruitive actions and reactions. But in the execution of different activities, one who secures some resources in <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> can understand the importance of service to the Lord through the causeless mercy of the Lord, as well as that of the spiritual master. A sincere soul is helped by the Lord through meeting a bona fide spiritual master, the representative of the Lord. By the instruction of such a spiritual master, one gets the seed of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu recommends that the devotee sow the seed of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> in his heart and nurture it by the watering of hearing and chanting the holy name, fame, etc., of the Lord. The simple process of offenselessly chanting and hearing the holy name of the Lord will gradually promote one very soon to the stage of emancipation. There are three stages in chanting the holy name of the Lord. The first stage is the offensive chanting of the holy name, and the second is the reflective stage of chanting the holy name. The third stage is the offenseless chanting of the holy name of the Lord. In the second stage only, the stage of reflection, between the offensive and offenseless stages, one automatically attains the stage of emancipation. And in the offenseless stage, one actually enters into the kingdom of God, although physically he may apparently be within the material world. To attain the offenseless stage, one must be on guard in the following manner.</div><A NAME="23600"></A><div class="Purport"><JD:"Destination-348">When we speak of hearing and chanting, it means that not only should one chant and hear of the holy name of the Lord as R&#257;ma, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (or systematically the sixteen names Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare Hare/ Hare R&#257;ma, Hare R&#257;ma, R&#257;ma R&#257;ma, Hare Hare), but one should also read and hear the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> in the association of devotees. The primary practice of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> will cause the seed already sowed in heart to sprout, and by a regular watering process, as mentioned above, the <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> creeper will begin to grow. By systematic nurturing, the creeper will grow to such an extent that it will penetrate the coverings of the universe, as we have heard in the previous verses, reach the effulgent sky, the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti,</span> and go farther and farther and reach the spiritual sky, where there are innumerable spiritual planets called Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;halokas. Above all of them is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;aloka, or Goloka V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, wherein the growing creeper enters and takes repose at the lotus feet of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the original Personality of Godhead. When one reaches the lotus feet of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a at Goloka V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, the watering process of hearing and reading, as also chanting of the holy name in the pure devotional stage, fructifies, and the fruits grown there in the form of love of God are tangibly tasted by the devotee, even though he is here in this material world. The ripe fruits of love of God are relished only by the devotees constantly engaged in the watering process as described above. But the working devotee must always be mindful so that the creeper which has so grown will not be cut off. Therefore he should be mindful of the following considerations:</div><A NAME="23601"></A><div class="Purport">(1) Offense by one at the feet of a pure devotee may be likened to the mad elephant who devastates a very good garden if it enters.</div><A NAME="23602"></A><div class="Purport">(2) One must be very careful to guard himself against such offenses at the feet of pure devotees, just as one protects a creeper by all-around fencing.</div><A NAME="23603"></A><div class="Purport">(3) It so happens that by the watering process some weeds are also grown, and unless such weeds are uprooted, the nurturing of the main creeper, or the creeper of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> may be hampered.</div><A NAME="23604"></A><div class="Purport">(4) Actually these weeds are material enjoyment, merging of the self in the Absolute without separate individuality, and many other desires in the field of religion, economic development, sense enjoyment and emancipation.</div><A NAME="23605"></A><div class="Purport">(5) There are many other weeds, like disobedience to the tenets of the revered scriptures, unnecessary engagements, killing animals, and hankering after material gain, prestige and adoration.</div><A NAME="23606"></A><div class="Purport">(6) If sufficient care is not taken, then the watering process may only help to breed the weeds, stunting the healthy growth of the main creeper and resulting in no fructification of the ultimate requirement: love of God.</div><A NAME="23607"></A><div class="Purport">(7) The devotee must therefore be very careful to uproot the different weeds in the very beginning.

The <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavatas</span> never accept merging in the impersonal rays of the Lord, but always aspire after personal association with the Supreme Lord in one of the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha spiritual planets in the spiritual sky. The whole of the spiritual sky, of which the total number of the material skies is only an insignificant part, is full of unlimited numbers of Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets. The destination of the devotee (the <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavata</span>) is to enter into one of the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets, in each of which the Personality of Godhead, in His unlimited personal expansions, enjoys Himself in the association of unlimited numbers of pure devotee associates. The conditioned souls in the material world, after gaining emancipation by devotional service, are promoted to these planets. But the number of ever-liberated souls is far, far greater than the number of conditioned souls in the material world, and the ever-liberated souls in the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets never care to visit this miserable material world.</div><A NAME="23624"></A><div class="Purport">The impersonalists, who aspire to merge in the impersonal <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> effulgence of the Supreme Lord but have no conception of loving devotional service to Him in His personal form in the spiritual manifestation, may be compared to certain species of fish, who, being born in the rivers and rivulets, migrate to the great ocean. They cannot stay in the ocean indefinitely, for their urge for sense gratification brings them back to the rivers and streams to spawn. Similarly, when the materialist becomes frustrated in his attempts to enjoy himself in the limited material world, he may seek impersonal liberation by merging either with the Causal Ocean or with the impersonal <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> effulgence. However, as neither the Causal Ocean nor the impersonal <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> effulgence affords any superior substitute for association and engagement of the senses, the impersonalist will fall again into the limited material world to become entangled once more in the wheel of births and deaths, drawn on by the inextinguishable desire for sensual engagement. But any devotee who enters the kingdom of God by transcendental engagement of his senses in devotional service, and who associates with the liberated souls and the Personality of Godhead there, will never be attracted to the limited surroundings of the material world.</div><A NAME="23625"></A><div class="Purport">In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexf129.html?g=2868">8.15</a>) also the same is confirmed, as the Lord says, "The great <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;s,</span> or the <span class="Italic">bhakti-yog&#299;s,</span> after attaining My association, never come back to this material world, which is full of miseries and is nonpermanent." The highest perfection of life, therefore, is to attain His association, and nothing else.

The impersonalist is desirous of becoming one with the Supreme, or in other words, he wants to become the Supreme. This is a myth only. The mystic <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> become encumbered by various mystic powers and so have neither peace nor satisfaction. So neither the impersonalists nor the <span class="Italic">yogi</span> can have real peace and satisfaction, but the devotee can become fully peaceful and satisfied because of his association with the complete whole. Therefore, merging in the Absolute or attaining some mystic powers has no attraction for the devotee.</div><A NAME="23627"></A><div class="Purport">Attainment of love of Godhead means complete freedom from all other attractions. The conditioned soul has many aspirations such as becoming a religious man, a rich man, or a first-class enjoyer or becoming God himself, or becoming powerful like the mystics and acting wonderfully by getting anything or doing anything, but all these aspirations should be rejected by the prospective devotee who actually wants to revive his dormant love of God. The impure devotee aspires after all of the abovementioned material things by perfection of devotion. But a pure devotee has none of the tinges of the above contaminations, which are the influence of material desires, impersonal speculations and attainment of mystic powers. One can attain the stage of love of God by pure devotional service, or by "a learned labor of love," for the sake of the devotee's lovable object, the Personality of Godhead.</div><A NAME="23628"></A><div class="Purport">To be more clear, if one wants to attain the stage of love of Godhead, he must give up all desires for material enjoyment, he should refrain from worshiping any of the demigods, and he should devote himself only to the worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He must give up the foolish idea of becoming one with the Lord and the desire to have some wonderful powers just to get the ephemeral adoration of the world. The pure devotee is only favorably engaged in the service of the Lord, without any hope of emolument.

And this fact is perceived and hypothesized in our acts of seeing and taking help from the intelligence.</div><A NAME="23685"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="23686"></A><div class="First">The general argument of the common man is that since the Lord is not visible to our eyes, how can one either surrender unto Him or render transcendental loving service unto Him? To such a common man, here is a practical suggestion given by &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; as to how one can perceive the Supreme Lord by reason and perception. Actually the Lord is not perceivable by our present materialized senses, but when one is convinced of the presence of the Lord by a practical service attitude, there is a revelation by the Lord's mercy, and such a pure devotee of the Lord can perceive the Lord's presence always and everywhere. He can perceive that intelligence is the form-direction of the Param&#257;tm&#257; plenary portion of the Personality of Godhead. The presence of Param&#257;tm&#257; in everyone's company is not very difficult to realize, even for the common man. The procedure is as follows. One can perceive one's self-identification and feel positively that he exists. He may not feel it very abruptly, but by using a little intelligence, he can feel that he is not the body. He can feel that the hand, the leg, the head, the hair and the limbs are all his bodily parts and parcels, but as such the hand, the leg, the head, etc., cannot be identified with his self. Therefore just by using intelligence he can distinguish and separate his self from other things that he sees. So the natural conclusion is that the living being, either man or beast, is the seer, and he sees besides himself all other things. So there is a difference between the seer and the seen. Now, by a little use of intelligence we can also readily agree that the living being who sees the things beyond himself by ordinary vision has no power to see or to move independently. All our ordinary actions and perceptions depend on various forms of energy supplied to us by nature in various combinations. Our senses of perception and of action, that is to say, our five perceptive senses of (1) hearing, (2) touch, (3) sight, (4) taste and (5) smell, as well as our five senses of action, namely (1) hands, (2) legs, (3) speech, (4) evacuation organs and (5) reproductive organs, and also our three subtle senses, namely (1) mind, (2) intelligence and (3) ego (thirteen senses in all), are supplied to us by various arrangements of gross or subtle forms of natural energy. And it is equally evident that our objects of perception are nothing but the products of the inexhaustible permutations and combinations of the forms taken by natural energy. As this conclusively proves that the ordinary living being has no independent power of perception or of motion, and as we undoubtedly feel our existence being conditioned by nature's energy, we conclude that he who sees is spirit, and that the senses as well as the objects of perception are material. The spiritual quality of the seer is manifest in our dissatisfaction with the limited state of materially conditioned existence. That is the difference between spirit and matter. There are some less intelligent arguments that matter develops the power of seeing and moving as a certain organic development, but such an argument cannot be accepted because there is no experimental evidence that matter has anywhere produced a living entity. Trust no future, however pleasant. Idle talks regarding future development of matter into spirit are actually foolish because no matter has ever developed the power of seeing or moving in any part of the world. Therefore it is definite that matter and spirit are two different identities, and this conclusion is arrived at by the use of intelligence. Now we come to the point that the things which are seen by a little use of intelligence cannot be animate unless we accept someone as the user of or director of the intelligence. Intelligence gives one direction like some higher authority, and the living being cannot see or move or eat or do anything without the use of intelligence. When one fails to take advantage of intelligence he becomes a deranged man, and so a living being is dependent on intelligence or the direction of a superior being. Such intelligence is all-pervading. Every living being has his intelligence, and this intelligence, being the direction of some higher authority, is just like a father giving direction to his son. The higher authority, who is present and residing within every individual living being, is the Superself.</div><A NAME="23687"></A><div class="Purport"><JD:"Destination-352">At this point in our investigation, we may consider the following question: on the one hand we realize that all our perceptions and activities are conditioned by arrangements of material nature, yet we also ordinarily feel and say, "I am perceiving" or "I am doing." Therefore we can say that our material senses of perception and action are moving because we are identifying the self with the material body, and that the superior principle of Superself is guiding and supplying us according to our desire. By taking advantage of the guidance of Superself in the form of intelligence, we can either continue to study and to put into practice our conclusion that "I am not this body," or we can choose to remain in the false material identification, fancying ourselves to be the possessors and doers. Our freedom consists in orienting our desire either toward the ignorant, material misconception or the true, spiritual conception. We can easily attain to the true, spiritual conception by recognizing the Superself (Param&#257;tm&#257;) to be our friend and guide and by dovetailing our intelligence with the superior intelligence of Param&#257;tm&#257;. The Superself and the individual self are both spirit, and therefore the Superself and the individual self are both qualitatively one and distinct from matter. But the Superself and the individual self cannot be on an equal level because the Superself gives direction or supplies intelligence and the individual self follows the direction, and thus actions are performed properly. The individual is completely dependent on the direction of the Superself because in every step the individual self follows the direction of the Superself in the matter of seeing, hearing, thinking, feeling, willing, etc.</div><A NAME="23688"></A><div class="Purport">So far as common sense is concerned, we come to the conclusion that there are three identities, namely matter, spirit and Superspirit. Now if we go to the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> or the Vedic intelligence, we can further understand that all three identities, namely matter, individual spirit, and the Superspirit, are all dependent on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Superself is a partial representation or plenary portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> affirms that the Supreme Personality of Godhead dominates all over the material world by His partial representation only. God is great, and He cannot be simply an order supplier of the individual selves; therefore the Superself cannot be a full representation of the Supreme Self, Puru&#7779;ottama, the Absolute Personality of Godhead. Realization of the Superself by the individual self is the beginning of self-realization, and by the progress of such self-realization one is able to realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead by intelligence, by the help of authorized scriptures, and, principally, by the grace of the Lord. The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> is the preliminary conception of the Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the further explanation of the science of Godhead. So if we stick to our determination and pray for the mercy of the director of intelligence sitting within the same bodily tree, like a bird sitting with another bird (as explained in the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads</span>), certainly the purport of the revealed informations in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> becomes clear to our vision, and there is no difficulty in realizing the Supreme Personality of Godhead, V&#257;sudeva. The intelligent man therefore, after many births of such use of intelligence, surrenders himself at the lotus feet of V&#257;sudeva, as confirmed by the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index4112.html?g=2631">7.19</a>).</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

All nine methods are bona fide methods, and either all of them, some of them or even one of them can bring about the desired result for the sincere devotee. But out of all the nine different methods, the first one, namely hearing, is the most important function in the process of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> Without hearing sufficiently and properly, no one can make any progress by any of the methods of practice. And for hearing only, all the Vedic literatures are there, compiled by authorized persons like Vy&#257;sadeva, who is the powerful incarnation of Godhead. And since it has been ascertained that the Lord is the Supersoul of everything, He should therefore be heard and glorified everywhere and always. That is the special duty of the human being. When the human being gives up the process of hearing about the all-pervading Personality of Godhead, he becomes victim to hearing rubbish transmitted by man-made machines. Machinery is not bad because through the machine one can take advantage of hearing about the Lord, but because machinery is used for ulterior purposes, it is creating rapid degradation in the standard of human civilization. It is said here that it is incumbent upon the human beings to hear because the scriptures like <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> are made for that purpose. Living beings other than human beings have no ability to hear such Vedic literatures. If human society gives itself to the process of hearing the Vedic literature, it will not become a victim to the impious sounds vibrated by impious men who degrade the standards of the total society. Hearing is solidified by the process of chanting. One who has perfectly heard from the perfect source becomes convinced about the all-pervading Personality of Godhead and thus becomes enthusiastic in glorifying the Lord. All the great <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas,</span> like R&#257;m&#257;nuja, Madhva, Caitanya, Sarasvat&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura or even, in other countries, Muhammad, Christ and others, have all extensively glorified the Lord by chanting always and in every place. Because the Lord is all-pervading, it is essential to glorify Him always and everywhere. In the process of glorifying the Lord there should be no restriction of time and space. This is called <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana-dharma</span> or <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavata-dharma.</span> <span class="Italic">San&#257;tana</span> means eternal, always and everywhere. <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata</span> means pertaining to Bhagav&#257;n, the Lord. The Lord is the master of all time and all space, and therefore the Lord's holy name must be heard, glorified and remembered everywhere in the world.

The more human society engages in the exploitation of undeveloped material resources for sense gratification, the more it will be entrapped by the illusory, material energy of the Lord, and thus the distress of the world will be intensified instead of diminished. The human necessities of life are fully supplied by the Lord in the shape of food grains, milk, fruit, wood, stone, sugar, silk, jewels, cotton, salt, water, vegetables, etc., in sufficient quantity to feed and care for the human race of the world as well as the living beings on each and every planet within the universe. The supply source is complete, and only a little energy by the human being is required to get his necessities into the proper channel. There is no need of machines and tools or huge steel plants for artificially creating comforts of life. Life is never made comfortable by artificial needs, but by plain living and high thinking. The highest perfectional thinking for human society is suggested here by &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, namely, sufficiently hearing <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> For men in this age of Kali, when they have lost the perfect vision of life, this <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the torchlight by which to see the real path. &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; Prabhup&#257;da has commented on the <span class="Italic">kath&#257;m&#7771;tam</span> mentioned in this verse and has indicated <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> to be the nectarean message of the Personality of Godhead. By sufficient hearing of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> the polluted aim of life, namely lording it over matter, will subside, and the people in general in all parts of the world will be able to live a peaceful life of knowledge and bliss.</div><A NAME="23717"></A><div class="Purport">For a pure devotee of the Lord, any topics in relation with His name, fame, quality, entourage, etc., are all pleasing, and because such topics have been approved by great devotees like N&#257;rada, Hanum&#257;n, Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and other inhabitants of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, certainly such messages are transcendental and pleasing to the heart and soul.</div><A NAME="23718"></A><div class="Purport">And by the constant hearing of the messages of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> and later of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> one is assured herein by &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; that he will reach the Personality of Godhead and render Him transcendental loving service in the spiritual planet of the name Goloka V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, which resembles a huge lotus flower.</div><A NAME="23719"></A><div class="Purport">Thus by the process of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> directly accepted, as suggested in this verse, by sufficient hearing of the transcendental message of the Lord, the material contamination is directly eliminated without one's attempting to contemplate the impersonal <span class="Italic">vir&#257;&#7789;</span> conception of the Lord. And by practicing <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> if the performer is not purified from the material contamination, he must be a pseudo-devotee.

Almost all of them have a wrong conception of life, for they identify themselves with the gross and subtle material bodies, which they are not, in fact. They may be situated in different high and low positions in the estimation of human society, but one should know definitely that unless one inquires about his own self beyond the body and the mind, all his activities in human life are total failures. Therefore out of thousands and thousands of men, one may inquire about his spirit self and thus consult the revealed scriptures like <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tras, Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> But in spite of reading and hearing such scriptures, unless one is in touch with a realized spiritual master, he cannot actually realize the real nature of self, etc. And out of thousands and hundreds of thousands of men, someone may know what Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is in fact. In the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Madhya</span> <a href="indexf741.html?g=125686">20.122</a>-123) it is said that Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, out of His causeless mercy, prepared the Vedic literatures in the incarnation of Vy&#257;sadeva for reading by the intelligent class of men in a human society which is almost totally forgetful of the genuine relation with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Even such an intelligent class of men may be forgetful in their relation with the Lord. The whole <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> process is therefore a revival of the lost relation. This revival is possible in the human form of life, which is obtained only out of the evolutionary cycle of 8,400,000 species of life. The intelligent class of human being must take a serious note of this opportunity. Not all human beings are intelligent, so the importance of human life is not always understood. Therefore <span class="Italic">man&#299;&#7779;i&#7751;&#257;m,</span> meaning "thoughtful," is particularly used here. A <span class="Italic">man&#299;&#7779;i&#7751;&#257;m</span> person, like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, must therefore take to the lotus feet of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and fully engage himself in devotional service, hearing, chanting, etc., of the holy name and pastimes of the Lord, which are all <span class="Italic">hari-kath&#257;m&#7771;ta.</span> This action is especially recommended when one is preparing for death.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

One who desires a long span of life should worship the demigods known as the A&#347;vin&#299;-kum&#257;ras, and a person desiring a strongly built body should worship the earth. One who desires stability in his post should worship the horizon and the earth combined. One who desires to be beautiful should worship the beautiful residents of the Gandharva planet, and one who desires a good wife should worship the Apsar&#257;s and the Urva&#347;&#299; society girls of the heavenly kingdom. One who desires domination over others should worship Lord Brahm&#257;, the head of the universe. One who desires tangible fame should worship the Personality of Godhead, and one who desires a good bank balance should worship the demigod Varu&#7751;a. If one desires to be a greatly learned man he should worship Lord &#346;iva, and if one desires a good marital relation he should worship the chaste goddess Um&#257;, the wife of Lord &#346;iva.</div><A NAME="23771"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="23772"></A><div class="First">There are different modes of worship for different persons desiring success in particular subjects. The conditioned soul living within the purview of the material world cannot be an expert in every type of materially enjoyable asset, but one can have considerable influence over a particular matter by worshiping a particular demigod, as mentioned above. R&#257;va&#7751;a was made a very powerful man by worshiping Lord &#346;iva, and he used to offer severed heads to please Lord &#346;iva. He became so powerful by the grace of Lord &#346;iva that all the demigods were afraid of him, until he at last challenged the Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; R&#257;macandra and thus ruined himself. In other words, all such persons who aspire after gaining some or all of the material objects of enjoyment, or the gross materialistic persons, are on the whole less intelligent, as confirmed in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexda67.html?g=2640">7.20</a>). It is said there that those who are bereft of all good sense, or those whose intelligence is withdrawn by the deluding energy of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> aspire to achieve all sorts of material enjoyment in life by pleasing the various demigods, or by advancing in material civilization under the heading of scientific progress. The real problem of life in the material world is to solve the question of birth, death, old age and disease. No one wants to change his birthright, no one wants to meet death, no one wants to be old or invalid, and no one wants diseases. But these problems are solved neither by the grace of any demigod nor by the so-called advancement of material science. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> as well as in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> such less intelligent persons have been described as devoid of all good sense. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; said that out of the 8,400,000 species of living entities, the human form of life is rare and valuable, and out of those rare human beings those who are conscious of the material problems are rarer still, and the still more rare persons are those who are conscious of the value of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> which contains the messages of the Lord and His pure devotees. Death is inevitable for everyone, intelligent or foolish. But Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja has been addressed by the Gosv&#257;m&#299; as the <span class="Italic">man&#299;&#7779;&#299;,</span> or the man of highly developed mind, because at the time of death he left all material enjoyment and completely surrendered unto the lotus feet of the Lord by hearing His messages from the right person, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;. But aspirations for material enjoyment by endeavoring persons are condemned. Such aspirations are something like the intoxication of the degraded human society. Intelligent persons should try to avoid these aspirations and seek instead the permanent life by returning home, back to Godhead.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Only those who are conditioned by the material modes of external energy are captivated by different types of material enjoyment. In other words, the transcendentalist has no material desires to be fulfilled, whereas the materialist has all types of desires to be fulfilled. The Lord has proclaimed that the materialists, who desire material enjoyment and thus seek the favor of different demigods, as above mentioned, are not in control of their senses and so give themselves to nonsense. One should therefore not desire any sort of material enjoyment, being sensible enough to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The leaders of nonsensical persons are still more nonsensical because they preach openly and foolishly that one can worship any form of demigod and get the same result. This sort of preaching is not only against the teachings of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> or those of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> but is also foolish, just as it is foolish to claim that with the purchase of any travel ticket one may reach the same destination. No one can reach Bombay from Delhi by purchasing a ticket for Baroda. It is clearly defined herein that persons impregnated with different desires have different modes of worship, but one who has no desire for material enjoyment should worship the Supreme Lord, &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Personality of Godhead. And this worshiping process is called devotional service. Pure devotional service means service to the Lord without any tinge of material desires, including desire for fruitive activity and empiric speculation. For fulfillment of material desires one may worship the Supreme Lord, but the result of such worship is different, as will be explained in the next verse. Generally the Lord does not fulfill anyone's material desires for sense enjoyment, but He awards such benedictions to worshipers of the Lord, for they ultimately come to the point of not desiring material enjoyment. The conclusion is that one must minimize the desires for material enjoyment, and for this one should worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is described here as <span class="Italic">param,</span> or beyond anything material. &#346;r&#299;p&#257;da &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya has also stated, <span class="Italic">n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a&#7717; paro 'vyakt&#257;t:</span> the Supreme Lord is beyond the material encirclement.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

A living being, naturally being the part and parcel of the supreme whole <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a&#7745; p&#363;r&#7751;am,</span> has as his natural function to serve the Supreme Being, just as the parts and parcels of the body, or the limbs of the body, are naturally meant to serve the complete body. Desireless means, therefore, not to be inert like the stone, but to be conscious of one's actual position and thus desire satisfaction only from the Supreme Lord. &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; has explained this desirelessness as <span class="Italic">bhajan&#299;ya-parama-puru&#7779;a-sukha-m&#257;tra-sva-sukhatvam</span> in his <span class="Italic">Sandarbha.</span> This means that one should feel happy only by experiencing the happiness of the Supreme Lord. This intuition of the living being is sometimes manifested even during the conditioned stage of a living being in the material world, and such intuition is expressed in the manner of altruism, philanthropy, socialism, communism, etc., by the undeveloped minds of less intelligent persons. In the mundane field such an outlook of doing good to others in the form of society, community, family, country or humanity is a partial manifestation of the same original feeling in which a pure living entity feels happiness by the happiness of the Supreme Lord. Such superb feelings were exhibited by the damsels of Vrajabh&#363;mi for the happiness of the Lord. The <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> loved the Lord without any return, and this is the perfect exhibition of the <span class="Italic">ak&#257;ma&#7717;</span> spirit. <span class="Italic">K&#257;ma</span> spirit, or the desire for one's own satisfaction, is fully exhibited in the material world, whereas the spirit of <span class="Italic">ak&#257;ma&#7717;</span> is fully exhibited in the spiritual world.</div><A NAME="23816"></A><div class="Purport">Thoughts of becoming one with the Lord, or being merged in the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti,</span> can also be exhibitions of <span class="Italic">k&#257;ma</span> spirit if they are desires for one's own satisfaction to be free from the material miseries. A pure devotee does not want liberation so that he may be relieved from the miseries of life. Even without so-called liberation, a pure devotee is aspirant for the satisfaction of the Lord. Influenced by the <span class="Italic">k&#257;ma</span> spirit, Arjuna declined to fight in the Kuruk&#7779;etra battlefield because he wanted to save his relatives for his own satisfaction. But being a pure devotee, he agreed to fight on the instruction of the Lord because he came to his senses and realized that satisfaction of the Lord at the cost of his own satisfaction was his prime duty. Thus he became <span class="Italic">ak&#257;ma.</span> That is the perfect stage of a perfect living being.</div><A NAME="23817"></A><div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Ud&#257;ra-dh&#299;&#7717;</span> means one who has a broader outlook. people with desires for material enjoyment worship small demigods, and such intelligence is condemned in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexda67.html?g=2640">7.20</a>) as <span class="Italic">h&#7771;ta j&ntilde;&#257;na,</span> the intelligence of one who has lost his senses.

The living entity in his pure state is conscious of the fact that he is a part and parcel of the Lord, but when he is thrown into the material world on account of his desire to lord it over material energy, he becomes conditioned by the three modes of material nature and thus struggles for existence for the highest benefit. This struggle for existence is something like following the will-o'-the-wisp under the spell of material enjoyment. All plans for material enjoyment, either by worship of different demigods as described in the previous verses of this chapter or by modernized advancement of scientific knowledge without the help of God or demigod, are illusory only, for despite all such plans for happiness, the conditioned living being within the compass of material creation can never solve the problems of life, namely birth, death, old age and disease. The history of the universe is full of such planmakers, and many kings and emperors come and go, leaving a planmaking story only. But the prime problems of life remain unsolved despite all endeavors by such planmakers.</div><A NAME="23832"></A><div class="Purport">Actually human life is meant for making a solution to the problems of life. One can never solve such problems by satisfying the different demigods, by different modes of worship, or by so-called scientific advancement in knowledge without the help of God or the demigods. Apart from the gross materialists, who care very little either for God or for the demigods, the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> recommend worship of different demigods for different benefits, and so the demigods are neither false nor imaginary. The demigods are as factual as we are, but they are much more powerful due to their being engaged in the direct service of the Lord in managing different departments in the universal government. The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> affirms this, and the different planets of the demigods are mentioned there, including the one of the supreme demigod, Lord Brahm&#257;. The gross materialists do not believe in the existence of God or the demigods. Nor do they believe that different planets are dominated by different demigods. They are creating a great commotion about reaching the closest celestial body, Candraloka, or the moon, but even after much mechanical research they have only very scanty information of this moon, and in spite of much false advertisement for selling land on the moon, the puffed-up scientists or gross materialists cannot live there, and what to speak of reaching the other planets, which they are unable even to count. However, the followers of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> have a different method of acquiring knowledge. They accept the statements of the Vedic literatures as authority <span class="Italic">in toto,</span> as we have already discussed in Canto One, and therefore they have full and reasonable knowledge of God and demigods and of their different residential planets situated within the compass of the material world and beyond the limit of the material sky. The most authentic Vedic literature, accepted by the great Indian <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> like &#346;a&#7749;kara, R&#257;m&#257;nuja, Madhva, Vi&#7779;&#7751;usv&#257;m&#299;, Nimb&#257;rka and Caitanya and studied by all important personalities of the world, is the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> in which the worship of the demigods and their respective residential planets are mentioned.

Therefore the demigods and their followers are all annihilated at the period of devastation, but one who reaches the kingdom of God gets a permanent share in eternal life. That is the verdict of Vedic literature. The worshipers of the demigods have one facility more than the unbelievers due to their being convinced of the Vedic version, by which they can get information of the benefit of worshiping the Supreme Lord in the association of the devotees of the Lord. The gross materialist, however, without any faith in the Vedic version, remains eternally in darkness, driven by a false conviction on the basis of imperfect experimental knowledge, or so-called material science, which can never reach into the realm of transcendental knowledge.</div><A NAME="23836"></A><div class="Purport">Therefore unless the gross materialists or the worshipers of the temporary demigods come in contact with a transcendentalist like the pure devotee of the Lord, their attempts are simply a waste of energy. Only by the grace of the divine personalities, the pure devotees of the Lord, can one achieve pure devotion, which is the highest perfection of human life. Only a pure devotee of the Lord can show one the right way of progressive life. Otherwise both the materialistic way of life, without any information of God or the demigods, and the life engaged in the worship of demigods, in pursuit of temporary material enjoyments, are different phases of phantasmagoria. They are nicely explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> also, but the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> can be understood in the association of pure devotees only, and not by the interpretations of politicians or dry philosophical speculators.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The complete functional activities of a pure devotee are always engaged in the service of the Lord, and thus the pure devotees exchange feelings of ecstasy between themselves and relish transcendental bliss. This transcendental bliss is experienced even in the stage of devotional practice (<span class="Italic">s&#257;dhana-avasth&#257;</span>), if properly undertaken under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master. And in the mature stage the developed transcendental feeling culminates in realization of the particular relationship with the Lord by which a living entity is originally constituted (up to the relationship of conjugal love with the Lord, which is estimated to be the highest transcendental bliss). Thus <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> being the only means of God realization, is called <span class="Italic">kaivalya.</span> &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; quotes the Vedic version (<span class="Italic">eko n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;o deva&#7717;, par&#257;var&#257;&#7751;&#257;&#7745; parama &#257;ste kaivalya-sa&#7745;j&ntilde;ita&#7717;</span>) in this connection and establishes that N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, the Personality of Godhead, is known as <span class="Italic">kaivalya,</span> and the means which enables one to approach the Lord is called the <span class="Italic">kaivalya-panth&#257;,</span> or the only means of attainment of Godhead. This <span class="Italic">kaivalya-panth&#257;</span> begins from <span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;a,</span> or hearing those topics that relate to the Personality of Godhead, and the natural consequence of hearing such <span class="Italic">hari-kath&#257;</span> is attainment of transcendental knowledge, which causes detachment from all mundane topics, for which a devotee has no taste at all. For a devotee, all mundane activities, social and political, become unattractive, and in the mature state such a devotee becomes uninterested even in his own body, and what to speak of bodily relatives. In such a state of affairs one is not agitated by the waves of the material modes. There are different modes of material nature, and all mundane functions in which a common man is very much interested or in which he takes part become unattractive for the devotee. This state of affairs is described herein as <span class="Italic">pratiniv&#7771;tta-gu&#7751;ormi,</span> and it is possible by <span class="Italic">&#257;tma-pras&#257;da,</span> or complete self-satisfaction without any material connection. The first-class devotee of the Lord attains this stage by devotional service, but despite his loftiness, for the Lord's satisfaction he may play the voluntary part of a preacher of the Lord's glory and dovetail all into devotional service, even mundane interest, just to give the neophytes a chance to transform mundane interest into transcendental bliss. &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; has described this action of a pure devotee as <span class="Italic">nirbandha&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-sambandhe yukta&#7745; vair&#257;gyam ucyate.</span> Even mundane activities dovetailed with service to the Lord are also calculated to be transcendental or approved <span class="Italic">kaivalya</span> affairs.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

For example, the epics or the histories of <span class="Italic">R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata,</span> which are specifically recommended for the less intelligent classes (women, <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> and unworthy sons of the higher castes), are also accepted as Vedic literature because they are compiled in connection with the activities of the Lord. <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> is accepted as the fifth division of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> after its first four divisions, namely <span class="Italic">S&#257;ma, Yajur, &#7770;g</span> and <span class="Italic">Atharva.</span> The less intelligent do not accept <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> as part of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> but great sages and authorities accept it as the fifth division of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> is also part of the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata,</span> and it is full of the Lord's instruction for the less intelligent class of men. Some less intelligent men say that <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> is not meant for householders, but such foolish men forget that <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> was explained to Arjuna, a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> (family man), and spoken by the Lord in His role as a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha.</span> So <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> although containing the high philosophy of the Vedic wisdom, is for the beginners in the transcendental science, and <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is for graduates and postgraduates in the transcendental science. Therefore literatures like <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, the, pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> and similar other literatures which are full of the pastimes of the Lord, are all transcendental literatures, and they should be discussed with full confidence in the society of great devotees.</div><A NAME="23880"></A><div class="Purport">The difficulty is that such literatures, when discussed by professional men, appear to be mundane literature like histories or epics because there are so many historical facts and figures. It is said here, therefore, that such literatures should be discussed in the assembly of devotees. Unless they are discussed by devotees, such literatures cannot be relished by the higher class of men. So the conclusion is that the Lord is not impersonal in the ultimate issue. He is the Supreme Person, and He has His different activities. He is the leader of all living entities, and He descends at His will and by His personal energy to reclaim the fallen souls. Thus He plays exactly like the social, political or religious leaders. Because such roles ultimately culminate in the discussion of topics of the Lord, all such preliminary topics are also transcendental. That is the way of spiritualizing the civic activities of human society. Men have inclinations for studying history and many other mundane literatures-stories, fiction, dramas, magazines, newspapers, etc.-so let them be dovetailed with the transcendental service of the Lord, and all of them will turn to the topics relished by all devotees. The propaganda that the Lord is impersonal, that He has no activity and that He is a dumb stone without any name and form has encouraged people to become godless, faithless demons, and the more they deviate from the transcendental activities of the Lord, the more they become accustomed to mundane activities that only clear their path to hell instead of return them home, back to Godhead.<PT:10><SP:3p>*<PT></SS> <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> begins from the history of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas (with necessary politics and social activities), and yet <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is said to be the <span class="Italic">P&#257;ramaha&#7745;sa-sa&#7745;hit&#257;,</span> or the Vedic literature meant for the topmost transcendentalist, and it describes <span class="Italic">para&#7745; j&ntilde;&#257;nam,</span> the highest transcendental knowledge. pure devotees of the Lord are all <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sas,</span> and they are like the swans, who know the art of sucking milk out of a mixture of milk and water.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

According to J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it must have heard about the childhood pastimes of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a at V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, for he used to imitate the pastimes with his young playmates. According to &#346;r&#299;dhara Sv&#257;m&#299;, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it used to imitate the worship of the family Deity by elderly members. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; also confirms the viewpoint of J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;. So accepting either of them, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was naturally inclined to Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a from his very childhood. He might have imitated either of the above-mentioned activities, and all of them establish his great devotion from his very childhood, a symptom of a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata.</span> Such <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavatas</span> are called <span class="Italic">nitya-siddhas,</span> or souls liberated from birth. But there are also others, who may not be liberated from birth but who develop a tendency for devotional service by association, and they are called <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhana-siddhas.</span> There is no difference between the two in the ultimate issue, and so the conclusion is that everyone can become a <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhana-siddha,</span> a devotee of the Lord, simply by association with the pure devotees. The concrete example is our great spiritual master &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada Muni. In his previous life he was simply a boy of a maidservant, but through association with great devotees he became a devotee of the Lord of his own standard, unique in the history of devotional service.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

So there must have been discussion of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who is glorified by great philosophers and in the company of great devotees.</div><A NAME="23908"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="23909"></A><div class="First">The word <span class="Italic">sat&#257;m</span> is very important in this verse. <span class="Italic">Sat&#257;m</span> means the pure devotees, who have no other desire than to serve the Lord. Only in the association of such devotees are the transcendental glories of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a properly discussed. It is said by the Lord that His topics are all full of spiritual significance, and once one properly hears about Him in the association of the <span class="Italic">sat&#257;m,</span> certainly one senses the great potency and so automatically attains to the devotional stage of life. As already described, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was a great devotee of the Lord from his very birth, and so was &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;. Both of them were on the same level, although it appeared that Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was a great king accustomed to royal facilities whereas &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was a typical renouncer of the world, so much so that he did not even put a cloth on his body. Superficially, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it and &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; might seem to be opposites, but basically they were both unalloyed pure devotees of the Lord. When such devotees are assembled together, there can be no topics save discussions of the glories of the Lord, or <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> also, when there were talks between the Lord and His devotee Arjuna, there could not be any topic other than <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> however the mundane scholars may speculate on it in their own ways. The use of the word <span class="Italic">ca</span> after <span class="Italic">vaiy&#257;saki&#7717;</span> suggests, according to &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;, that both &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it were of the same category, settled long before, although one was playing the part of the master and the other the disciple. Since Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the center of the topics, the word <span class="Italic">v&#257;sudeva-par&#257;ya&#7751;a&#7717;,</span> or "devotee of V&#257;sudeva," suggests devotee of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the common aim. Although there were many others who assembled at the place where Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was fasting, the natural conclusion is that there was no topic other than the glorification of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, because the principal speaker was &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; and the chief audience was Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it. So <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> as it was spoken and heard by two principal devotees of the Lord, is only for the glorification of the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Time and tide wait for no man. So the time indicated by the sunrise and the sunset will be uselessly wasted if such time is not properly utilized for realizing identification of spiritual values. Even a fraction of the duration of life wasted cannot be compensated by any amount of gold. Human life is simply awarded to a living entity (<span class="Italic">j&#299;va</span>) so that he can realize his spiritual identity and his permanent source of happiness. A living being, especially the human being, is seeking happiness because happiness is the natural situation of the living entity. But he is vainly seeking happiness in the material atmosphere. A living being is constitutionally a spiritual spark of the complete whole, and his happiness can be perfectly perceived in spiritual activities. The Lord is the complete spirit whole, and His name, form, quality, pastimes, entourage and personality are all identical with Him. Once a person comes into contact with any one of the above-mentioned energies of the Lord through the proper channel of devotional service, the door to perfection is immediately opened. In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index5584.html?g=745">2.40</a>) the Lord has explained such contact in the following words: "Endeavors in devotional service are never baffled. Nor is there failure. A slight beginning of such activities is sufficient even to deliver a person from the great ocean of material fears." As a highly potent drug injected intravenously acts at once on the whole body, the transcendental topics of the Lord injected through the ear of the pure devotee of the Lord can act very efficiently. Aural realization of the transcendental messages implies total realization, just as fructification of one part of a tree implies fructification of all other parts. This realization for a moment in the association of pure devotees like &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; prepares one's complete life for eternity. And thus the sun fails to rob the pure devotee of his duration of life, inasmuch as he is constantly busy in the devotional service of the Lord, purifying his existence. Death is a symptom of the material infection of the eternal living being; only due to material infection is the eternal living entity subjected to the law of birth, death, old age and disease.</div><A NAME="23924"></A><div class="Purport">The materialistic way of pious activities like charity is recommended in the <span class="Italic">sm&#7771;ti-&#347;&#257;stras</span> as quoted by &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura. Money given in charity to a suitable person is guaranteed bank balance in the next life. Such charity is recommended to be given to a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> If the money is given in charity to a non-<span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> (without brahminical qualification) the money is returned in the next life in the same proportion. If it is given in charity to a half-educated <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> even then the money is returned double. If the money is given in charity to a learned and fully qualified <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> the money is returned a hundred and a thousand times, and if the money is given to a <span class="Italic">veda-p&#257;raga</span> (one who has factually realized the path of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span>), it is returned by unlimited multiplication. The ultimate end of Vedic knowledge is realization of the Personality of Godhead, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, as stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">vedai&#347; ca sarvair aham eva vedya&#7717;</I> [Bg. </span></I><a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a>]). There is a guarantee of money's being returned if given in charity, regardless of the proportion. Similarly, a moment passed in the association of a pure devotee by hearing and chanting the transcendental messages of the Lord is a perfect guarantee for eternal life, for returning home, back to Godhead. <span class="Italic">Mad-dh&#257;ma gatv&#257; punar janma na vidyate.</span> In other words, a devotee of the Lord is guaranteed eternal life. A devotee's old age or disease in the present life is but an impetus to such guaranteed eternal life.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Life is meant for the maximum duration of existence for eating, drinking, sexual intercourse, making merry and enjoying life. The modern man wants to live forever by the advancement of material science, and there are many foolish theories for prolonging life to the maximum duration. But the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> affirms that life is not meant for so-called economic development or advancement of materialistic science for the hedonistic philosophy of eating, mating, drinking and merrymaking. Life is solely meant for <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> for purifying existence so that one may enter into eternal life just after the end of the human form of life.</div><A NAME="23939"></A><div class="Purport">The materialists want to prolong life as much as possible because they have no information of the next life. They want to get the maximum comforts in this present life because they think conclusively that there is no life after death. This ignorance about the eternity of the living being and the change of covering in the material world has played havoc in the structure of modern human society. Consequently there are many problems, multiplied by various plans of modernized man. The plans for solving the problems of society have only aggravated the troubles. Even if it is possible to prolong life more than one hundred years, advancement of human civilization does not necessarily follow. The <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> says that certain trees live for hundreds and thousands of years. At V&#7771;nd&#257;vana there is a tamarind tree (the place is known as Imlitala) which is said to have existed since the time of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. In the Calcutta Botanical Garden there is a banyan tree said to be older than five hundred years, and there are many such trees all over the world. Sv&#257;m&#299; &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya lived only thirty-two years, and Lord Caitanya lived forty-eight years. Does it mean that the prolonged lives of the abovementioned trees are more important than &#346;a&#7749;kara or Caitanya? Prolonged life without spiritual value is not very important. One may doubt that trees have life because they do not breathe. But modern scientists like Bose have already proved that there is life in plants, so breathing is no sign of actual life. The <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> says that the bellows of the blacksmith breathes very soundly, but that does not mean that the bellows has life. The materialist will argue that life in the tree and life in the man cannot be compared because the tree cannot enjoy life by eating palatable dishes or by enjoying sexual intercourse. In reply to this, the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> asks whether other animals like the dogs and hogs, living in the same village with human beings, do not eat and enjoy sexual life. The specific utterance of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> in regard to "other animals" means that persons who are simply engaged in planning a better type of animal life consisting of eating, breathing and mating are also animals in the shape of human beings. A society of such polished animals cannot benefit suffering humanity, for an animal can easily harm another animal but rarely do good.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Modern university education practically prepares one to acquire a doggish mentality with which to accept the service of a greater master. After finishing a so-called education, the so-called educated persons move like dogs from door to door with applications for some service, and mostly they are driven away, informed of no vacancy. As dogs are negligible animals and serve the master faithfully for bits of bread, a man serves a master faithfully without sufficient rewards.</div><A NAME="23954"></A><div class="Purport">Persons who have no discrimination in the matter of foodstuff and who eat all sorts of rubbish are compared to hogs. Hogs are very much attached to eating stools. So stool is a kind of foodstuff for a particular type of animal. And even stones are eatables for a particular type of animal or bird. But the human being is not meant for eating everything and anything; he is meant to eat grains, vegetables, fruits, milk, sugar, etc. Animal food is not meant for the human being. For chewing solid food, the human being has a particular type of teeth meant for cutting fruits and vegetables. The human being is endowed with two canine teeth as a concession for persons who will eat animal food at any cost. It is known to everyone that one man's food is another man's poison. Human beings are expected to accept the remnants of food offered to Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and the Lord accepts foodstuff from the categories of leaves, flowers, fruits, etc. (Bg. <a href="index8855.html?g=3219">9.26</a>). As prescribed by Vedic scriptures, no animal food is offered to the Lord. Therefore, a human being is meant to eat a particular type of food. He should not imitate the animals to derive so-called vitamin values. Therefore, a person who has no discrimination in regard to eating is compared to a hog.</div><A NAME="23955"></A><div class="Purport">The camel is a kind of animal that takes pleasure in eating thorns. A person who wants to enjoy family life or the worldly life of so-called enjoyment is compared to the camel. Materialistic life is full of thorns, and so one should live only by the prescribed method of Vedic regulations just to make the best use of a bad bargain. Life in the material world is maintained by sucking one's own blood. The central point of attraction for material enjoyment is sex life. To enjoy sex life is to suck one's own blood, and there is not much more to be explained in this connection. The camel also sucks its own blood while chewing thorny twigs. The thorns the camel eats cut the tongue of the camel, and so blood begins to flow within the camel's mouth. The thorns, mixed with fresh blood, create a taste for the foolish camel, and so he enjoys the thorn-eating business with false pleasure. Similarly, the great business magnates, industrialists who work very hard to earn money by different ways and questionable means, eat the thorny results of their actions mixed with their own blood. Therefore the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> has situated these diseased fellows along with the camels.</div><A NAME="23956"></A><div class="Purport">The ass is an animal who is celebrated as the greatest fool, even amongst the animals. The ass works very hard and carries burdens of the maximum weight without making profit for itself. Footnote. The ass is generally engaged by the washerman, whose social position is not very respectable. And the special qualification of the ass is that it is very much accustomed to being kicked by the opposite sex. When the ass begs for sexual intercourse, he is kicked by the fair sex, yet he still follows the female for such sexual pleasure. A henpecked man is compared, therefore, to the ass. The general mass of people work very hard, especially in the age of Kali. In this age the human being is actually engaged in the work of an ass, carrying heavy burdens and driving <span class="Italic">&#7789;hel&#257;</span> and rickshaws. The so-called advancement of human civilization has engaged a human being in the work of an ass. The laborers in great factories and workshops are also engaged in such burdensome work, and after working hard during the day, the poor laborer has to be again kicked by the fair sex, not only for sex enjoyment but also for so many household affairs.</div><A NAME="23957"></A><div class="Purport">So <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam's</span> categorization of the common man without any spiritual enlightenment into the society of dogs, hogs, camels and asses is not at all an exaggeration. The leaders of such ignorant masses of people may feel very proud of being adored by such a number of dogs and hogs, but that is not very flattering. The <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> openly declares that although a person may be a great leader of such dogs and hogs disguised as men, if he has no taste for being enlightened in the science of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, such a leader is also an animal and nothing more. He may be designated as a powerful, strong animal, or a big animal, but in the estimation of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> he is never given a place in the category of man, on account of his atheistic temperament. Or, in other words, such godless leaders of dogs and hoglike men are bigger animals with the qualities of animals in greater proportion.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

It is the transcendental dynamic force of the spirit soul; therefore a devotee is engaged one hundred percent in the service of the Lord. One can engage in devotional service when the senses of the body are purified in relation with the Lord, and one can render service to the Lord with the help of all the senses. As such, the senses and the action of the senses are to be considered impure or materialistic as long as they are employed only in sense gratification. The purified senses are engaged not in sense gratification but in the service of the Lord <span class="Italic">in toto.</span> The Lord is the Supreme with all senses, and the servitor, who is part and parcel of the Lord, also has the same senses. Service to the Lord is the completely purified use of the senses, as described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> The Lord imparted instructions with full senses, and Arjuna received them with full senses, and thus there was a perfect exchange of sensible and logical understanding between the master and the disciple. Spiritual understanding is nothing like an electrical charge from the master to the disciple, as foolishly claimed by some propaganda-mongers. Everything is full of sense and logic, and the exchange of views between the master and disciple is possible only when the reception is submissive and real. In the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta</span> it is said that one should receive the teaching of Lord Caitanya with intellect and full senses so that one can logically understand the great mission.</div><A NAME="23972"></A><div class="Purport">In the impure state of a living being, the various senses are fully engaged in mundane affairs. If the ear is not engaged in the service of the Lord by hearing about Him from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> or <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> certainly the holes of the ear will be filled with some rubbish. Therefore the messages of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> should be preached all over the world very loudly. That is the duty of a pure devotee who has actually heard about them from the perfect sources. Many want to speak something to others, but because they are not trained to speak on the subject matter of Vedic wisdom they are all speaking nonsense, and people are receiving them with no sense. There are hundreds and thousands of sources for distributing mundane news of the world, and people of the world are also receiving it. Similarly, the people of the world should be taught to hear the transcendental topics of the Lord, and the devotee of the Lord must speak loudly so that they can hear. The frogs loudly croak, with the result that they invite the snakes to eat them. The human tongue is especially given for chanting the Vedic hymns and not for croaking like frogs. <JD:"Destination-367">The word <span class="Italic">asat&#299;</span> used in this verse is also significant. <span class="Italic">Asat&#299;</span> means a woman who has become a prostitute. A prostitute has no reputation for good womanly qualities. Similarly, the tongue, which is given to the human being for chanting the Vedic hymns, will be considered a prostitute when engaged in chanting some mundane nonsense.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The first-class devotee does not at all see anyone who is not in the service of the Lord, but the second-class devotee makes distinctions between devotees and nondevotees. The second-class devotees are therefore meant for preaching work, and as referred to in the above verse, they must loudly preach the glories of the Lord. The second-class devotee accepts disciples from the section of third-class devotees or nondevotees. Sometimes the first-class devotee also comes down to the category of the second-class devotee for preaching work. But the common man, who is expected to become at least a third-class devotee, is advised herein to visit the temple of the Lord and bow down before the Deity, even though he may be a very rich man or even a king with a silk turban or crown. The Lord is the Lord of everyone, including the great kings and emperors, and men who are rich in the estimation of mundane people must therefore make it a point to visit the temple of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and regularly bow down before the Deity. The Lord in the temple in the worshipable form is never to be considered to be made of stone or wood, for the Lord in His <span class="Italic">arc&#257;</span> incarnation as the Deity in the temple shows immense favor to the fallen souls by His auspicious presence. By the hearing process, as mentioned hereinbefore, this realization of the presence of the Lord in the temple is made possible. As such, the first process in the routine work of devotional service-hearing-is the essential point. Hearing by all classes of devotees from the authentic sources like <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is essential. The common man who is puffed up with his material position and does not bow down before the Deity of the Lord in the temple, or who defies temple worship without any knowledge of the science, must know that his so-called turban or crown will only succeed in further drowning him in the water of the ocean of material existence. A drowning man with a heavy weight on his head is sure to go down more swiftly than those who have no heavy weight. A foolish, puffed-up man defies the science of God and says that God has no meaning for him, but when he is in the grip of God's law and is caught by some disease like cerebral thrombosis, that godless man sinks into the ocean of nescience by the weight of his material acquisition. Advancement of material science without God consciousness is a heavy load on the head of human society, and so one must take heed of this great warning.</div><A NAME="23987"></A><div class="Purport">The common man, if he has no time to worship the Lord, may at least engage his hands for a few seconds in washing or sweeping the Lord's temple. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Prat&#257;parudra, the greatly powerful king of Orissa, was always very busy with heavy state responsibilities, yet he made it a point to sweep the temple of Lord Jagann&#257;tha at Pur&#299; once a year during the festival of the Lord. The idea is that however important a man one may be he must accept the supremacy of the Supreme Lord. This God consciousness will help a man even in his material prosperity. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Prat&#257;parudra's subordination before Lord Jagann&#257;tha made him a powerful king, so much so that even the great Pathan in his time could not enter into Orissa on account of the powerful Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Prat&#257;parudra. And at last Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Prat&#257;parudra was graced by Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya on the very grounds of his acceptance of subordination to the Lord of the universe. So even though a rich man's wife has glittering bangles made of gold on her hands, she must engage herself in rendering service to the Lord.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Simple theoretical book knowledge is not sufficient for a neophyte devotee. Book knowledge is theoretical, whereas the <span class="Italic">arcana</span> process is practical. Spiritual knowledge must be developed by a combination of theoretical and practical knowledge, and that is the guaranteed way for attainment of spiritual perfection. The training of devotional service for a neophyte devotee completely depends on the expert spiritual master who knows how to lead his disciple to make gradual progress towards the path back home, back to Godhead. One should not become a pseudo spiritual master as a matter of business to meet one's family expenditures; one must be an expert spiritual master to deliver the disciple from the clutches of impending death. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura has defined the bona fide qualities of a spiritual master, and one of the verses in that description reads:</div><A NAME="24002"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">&#347;r&#299;-vigrah&#257;r&#257;dhana-nitya-n&#257;n&#257;-<br>&#347;&#7771;&#7749;g&#257;ra-tan-mandira-m&#257;rjan&#257;dau<br>yuktasya bhakt&#257;&#7745;&#347; ca niyu&ntilde;jato 'pi<br>vande guro&#7717; &#347;r&#299;-cara&#7751;&#257;ravindam<span class="Italic"> **</span></div></div><A NAME="24003"></A><div class="After-Verse"><span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;-vigraha</span> is the <span class="Italic">arc&#257;,</span> or suitable worshipable form of the Lord, and the disciple should be engaged in worshiping the Deity regularly by <span class="Italic">&#347;&#7771;&#7749;g&#257;ra,</span> by proper decoration and dressing, as also by <span class="Italic">mandira-m&#257;rjana,</span> the matter of cleansing the temple. The spiritual master teaches the neophyte devotee all these kindly and personally to help him gradually in the realization of the transcendental name, quality, form, etc., of the Lord.</div><A NAME="24004"></A><div class="Purport">Only attention engaged in the service of the Lord, especially in dressing and decorating the temple, accompanied by musical <span class="Italic">k&#299;rtana</span> and spiritual instructions from scriptures, can save the common man from the hellish cinema attractions and rubbish sex-songs broadcast everywhere by radios. If one is unable to maintain a temple at home, he should go to another's temple where all the above performances are regularly executed. Visiting the temple of a devotee and looking at the profusely decorated forms of the Lord well dressed in a well-decorated, sanctified temple naturally infuse the mundane mind with spiritual inspiration. People should visit holy places like V&#7771;nd&#257;vana where such temples and worship of the Deity are specifically maintained. Formerly all rich men like kings and rich merchants constructed such temples under the direction of expert devotees of the Lord, like the six Gosv&#257;m&#299;s, and it is the duty of the common man to take advantage of these temples and festivals observed in the holy places of pilgrimage by following in the footsteps of great devotees (<span class="Italic">anuvraja</span>). One should not visit all these sanctified pilgrimage places and temples with sightseeing in mind, but one must go to such temples and sanctified places immortalized by the transcendental pastimes of the Lord and be guided by proper men who know the science. This is called <span class="Italic">anuvraja.</span> <span class="Italic">Anu</span> means to follow. It is therefore best to follow the instruction of the bona fide spiritual master, even in visiting temples and the holy places of pilgrimage. One who does not move in that way is as good as a standing tree condemned by the Lord not to move. The moving tendency of the human being is misused by visiting places for sightseeing.

When a man dies, he is called dead, but when he again appears in a subtle form not visible to our present vision and yet acts, such a dead body is called a ghost. Ghosts are always very bad elements, always creating a fearful situation for others. Similarly, the ghostlike nondevotees who have no respect for the pure devotees, nor for the Vi&#7779;&#7751;u Deity in the temples, create a fearful situation for the devotees at all times. The Lord never accepts any offering by such impure ghosts. There is a common saying that one should first love the dog of the beloved before one shows any loving sentiments for the beloved. The stage of pure devotion is attained by sincerely serving a pure devotee of the Lord. The first condition of devotional service to the Lord is therefore to be a servant of a pure devotee, and this condition is fulfilled by the statement "reception of the dust of the lotus feet of a pure devotee who has also served another pure devotee." That is the way of pure disciplic succession, or devotional <span class="Italic">parampar&#257;.</span></div><A NAME="24019"></A><div class="Purport">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a inquired from the great saint Ja&#7693;a Bharata as to how he had attained such a liberated stage of a <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa,</span> and in answer the great saint replied as follows (<span class="Ref_Italic">SB</span> <a href="index0119.html?g=43978">5.12.12</a>):</div><A NAME="24020"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">rah&#363;ga&#7751;aitat tapas&#257; na y&#257;ti<br>na cejyay&#257; nirvapa&#7751;&#257;d g&#7771;h&#257;d v&#257;<br>na cchandas&#257; naiva jal&#257;gni-s&#363;ryair<br>vin&#257; mahat-p&#257;da-rajo-'bhi&#7779;ekam</div></div><A NAME="24021"></A><div class="After-Verse">"O King Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a, the perfectional stage of devotional service, or the <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa</span> stage of life, cannot be attained unless one is blessed by <span class="Italic">the dust of the feet of great devotees.</span> It is never attained by <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> [austerity], the Vedic worshiping process, acceptance of the renounced order of life, the discharge of the duties of household life, the chanting of the Vedic hymns, or the performance of penances in the hot sun, within cold water or before the blazing fire."</div><A NAME="24022"></A><div class="Purport">In other words, Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the property of His pure unconditional devotees, and as such only the devotees can deliver K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a to another devotee; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is never obtainable directly. Lord Caitanya therefore designated Himself as <span class="Italic">gop&#299;-bhartu&#7717; pada-kamalayor d&#257;sa-d&#257;s&#257;nud&#257;sa&#7717;</span></I> [<I>Cc.

A pure devotee therefore never approaches the Lord directly, but tries to please the servant of the Lord's servants, and thus the Lord becomes pleased, and only then can the devotee relish the taste of the <span class="Italic">tulas&#299;</span> leaves stuck to His lotus feet. In the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> it is said that the Lord is never to be found by becoming a great scholar of the Vedic literatures, but He is very easily approachable through His pure devotee. In V&#7771;nd&#257;vana all the pure devotees pray for the mercy of &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;&#7751;&#299;, the pleasure potency of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;&#7751;&#299; is a tenderhearted feminine counterpart of the supreme whole, resembling the perfectional stage of the worldly feminine nature. Therefore, the mercy of R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;&#7751;&#299; is available very readily to the sincere devotees, and once She recommends such a devotee to Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Lord at once accepts the devotee's admittance into His association. The conclusion is, therefore, that one should be more serious about seeking the mercy of the devotee than that of the Lord directly, and by one's doing so (by the good will of the devotee) the natural attraction for the service of the Lord will be revived.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

In the First Chapter the first step in devotional service for God consciousness by the process of hearing and chanting has been stressed, and a gross conception of the Personality of Godhead in His universal form for the beginners is recommended. By such a gross conception of God through the material manifestations of His energy, one is enabled to spiritualize the mind and the senses and gradually concentrate the mind upon Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Supreme, who is present as the Supersoul in every heart and everywhere, in every atom of the material universe. The system of <span class="Italic">pa&ntilde;ca-up&#257;san&#257;,</span> recommending five mental attitudes for the common man, is also enacted for this purpose, namely gradual development, worship of the superior that may be in the form of fire, electricity, the sun, the mass of living beings, Lord &#346;iva and, at last, the impersonal Supersoul, the partial representation of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. They are all nicely described in the Second Chapter, but in the Third Chapter further development is prescribed after one has actually reached the stage of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u worship, or pure devotional service, and the mature stage of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u worship is suggested herein in relation to the change of heart.</div><A NAME="24037"></A><div class="Purport">The whole process of spiritual culture is aimed at changing the heart of the living being in the matter of his eternal relation with the Supreme Lord as subordinate servant, which is his eternal constitutional position. So with the progress of devotional service, the reaction of change in the heart is exhibited by gradual detachment from the sense of material enjoyment by a false sense of lording it over the world and an increase in the attitude of rendering loving service to the Lord. <span class="Italic">Vidhi-bhakti,</span> or regulated devotional service by the limbs of the body (namely the eyes, the ears, the nose, the hands and the legs, as already explained hereinbefore), is now stressed herein in relation to the mind, which is the impetus for all activities of the limbs of the body. It is expected by all means that by discharging regulated devotional service one must manifest the change of heart. If there is no such change, the heart must be considered steel-framed, for it is not melted even when there is chanting of the holy name of the Lord. We must always remember that hearing and chanting are the basic principles of discharging devotional duties, and if they are properly performed there will follow the reactional ecstasy with signs of tears in the eyes and standing of the hairs on the body. These are natural consequences and are the preliminary symptoms of the <span class="Italic">bh&#257;va</span> stage, which occurs before one reaches the perfectional stage of <span class="Italic">prema,</span> love of Godhead.</div><A NAME="24038"></A><div class="Purport">If the reaction does not take place, even after continuous hearing and chanting of the holy name of the Lord, it may be considered to be due to offenses only. That is the opinion of the <span class="Italic">Sandarbha.</span> In the beginning of chanting of the holy name of the Lord, if the devotee has not been very careful about evading the ten kinds of offenses at the feet of the holy name, certainly the reaction of feelings of separation will not be visible by tears in the eyes and standing of the hair on end.</div><A NAME="24039"></A><div class="Purport">The <span class="Italic">bh&#257;va</span> stage is manifested by eight transcendental symptoms, namely inertness, perspiration, standing of hairs on end, failing in the voice, trembling, paleness of the body, tears in the eyes and finally trance. <span class="Italic">The Nectar of Devotion,</span> a summary study of &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299;'s <span class="Italic">Bhakti-ras&#257;m&#7771;ta-sindhu,</span> explains those symptoms and vividly describes other transcendental developments, both in steady and accelerating manifestations.</div><A NAME="24040"></A><div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura has very critically discussed all these <span class="Italic">bh&#257;va</span> displays in connection with some unscrupulous neophyte's imitating the above symptoms for cheap appreciation. Not only Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; but also &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; treated them very critically. Sometimes all the above eight symptoms of ecstasy are imitated by the mundane devotees (<span class="Italic">pr&#257;k&#7771;ta-sahajiy&#257;s</span>), but the pseudo symptoms are at once detected when one sees the pseudo devotee addicted to so many forbidden things. Even though decorated with the signs of a devotee, a person addicted to smoking, drinking or illegitimate sex with women cannot have all the above-mentioned ecstatic symptoms. But it is seen that sometimes these symptoms are willfully imitated, and for this reason &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; accuses the imitators of being stonehearted men. They are sometimes even affected by the reflection of such transcendental symptoms, yet if they still do not give up the forbidden habits, then they are hopeless cases for transcendental realization.</div><A NAME="24041"></A><div class="Purport">When Lord Caitanya met &#346;r&#299;la R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya of Kavaur on the bank of the God&#257;var&#299;, the Lord developed all these symptoms, but because of the presence of some nondevotee <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> who were attendants of the R&#257;ya, the Lord suppressed these symptoms. So sometimes they are not visible even in the body of the first-class devotee for certain circumstantial reasons. Therefore real, steady <span class="Italic">bh&#257;va</span> is definitely displayed in the matter of cessation of material desires (<span class="Italic">k&#7779;&#257;nti</span>), utilization of every moment in the transcendental loving service of the Lord (<span class="Italic">avy&#257;rtha-k&#257;latvam</I> [</I>Cc. </span><I>Madhya</I> <a href="indexa378.html?g=130049">23.18</a>-19]), eagerness for glorifying the Lord constantly (<span class="Italic">n&#257;ma-g&#257;ne sad&#257; ruci</span> [<I>Cc. Madhya</I> <a href="index7c63.html?g=130148">23.32</a>]), attraction for living in the land of the Lord (<span class="Italic">pr&#299;tis tad-vasati sthale Pr&#299;tis tad vasati sth&#257;le</span>), complete detachment from material happiness (<span class="Italic">virakti</span>), and pridelessness (<span class="Italic">m&#257;na-&#347;&#363;nyat&#257;</span>). One who has developed all these transcendental qualities is really possessed of the <span class="Italic">bh&#257;va</span> stage, as distinguished from the stonehearted imitator or mundane devotee.</div><A NAME="24042"></A><div class="Purport">The whole process can be summarized as follows: The advanced devotee who chants the holy name of the Lord in a perfectly offenseless manner and is friendly to everyone can actually relish the transcendental taste of glorifying the Lord. And the result of such realization is reflected in the cessation of all material desires, etc., as mentioned above. The neophytes, due to their being in the lower stage of devotional service, are invariably envious, so much so that they invent their own ways and means of devotional regulations without following the <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas.</span> As such, even if they make a show of constantly chanting the holy name of the Lord, they cannot relish the transcendental taste of the holy name. Therefore, the show of tears in the eyes, trembling, perspiration or unconsciousness, etc., is condemned. They can, however, get in touch with a pure devotee of the Lord and rectify their bad habits; otherwise they shall continue to be stonehearted and unfit for any treatment. A complete progressive march on the return path home, back to Godhead, will depend on the instructions of the revealed scriptures directed by a realized devotee.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

This means "existing" and "chaste." And both imports are perfectly applicable in the case of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it. The whole Vedic adventure is to draw one's attention entirely unto the lotus feet of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a without any diversion, as instructed in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a>). Fortunately Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it had already been attracted to the Lord from the very beginning of his body, in the womb of his mother. In the womb of his mother he was struck by the <span class="Italic">brahm&#257;stra</span> atomic bomb released by A&#347;vatth&#257;m&#257;, but by the grace of the Lord he was saved from being burnt by the fiery weapon, and since then the King continuously concentrated his mind upon Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, which made him perfectly chaste in devotional service. So by natural sequence he was a chaste devotee of the Lord, and when he further heard from &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; that one should worship the Lord only and no one else, even though full of all desires or desireless, his natural affection for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was strengthened. We have already discussed these topics.</div><A NAME="24076"></A><div class="Purport">To become a pure devotee of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, two things are very much essential, namely having a chance to be born in the family of a devotee and having the blessings of a bona fide spiritual master. By the grace of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja had both opportunities. He was born in a family of such devotees as the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, and just to continue the dynasty of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas and show them special favor, the Lord specifically saved Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, who later on, by the arrangement of the Lord, was cursed by the boy of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> and was able to get the association of such a spiritual master as &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;. In the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta</span> it is said that a fortunate person, by the mercy of the spiritual master and Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, achieves the path of devotional service. This was perfectly applicable in the case of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it. By way of being born in a family of devotees, he automatically came in touch with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and after being so contacted he constantly remembered Him. Consequently Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a gave the King a further chance for development in devotional service by introducing him to &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, a stalwart devotee of the Lord with perfect knowledge in self-realization. And by hearing from a bona fide spiritual master, he was perfectly able to concentrate his chaste mind further upon Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, as a matter of course.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

One selects a wife for bodily comforts, and the result is children. For wife and children one requires a dwelling place, and as such a residential house is also necessary. Animals like horses, elephants, cows and dogs are all household animals, and a householder has to keep them as household paraphernalia. In modern civilization the horses and elephants have been replaced by cars and conveyances with considerable horsepower. To maintain all the household affairs, one has to increase the bank balance and be careful about the treasury house, and in order to display the opulence of material assets, one has to keep good relations with friends and relatives, as well as become very careful about maintaining the status quo. This is called material civilization of material attachment. Devotion for Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a means negation of all material attachments as detailed above. By the grace of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was awarded all material amenities and an undisputed kingdom in which to enjoy the undisturbed position of king, but by the grace of the Lord he was able to give up all connections with material attachment. That is the position of a pure devotee. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, due to his natural affection for Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as a devotee of the Lord, was always executing his royal duties on behalf of the Lord, and as a responsible king of the world he was always careful to see that the influence of Kali would not enter his kingdom. A devotee of the Lord never thinks of his household paraphernalia as his own, but surrenders everything for the service of the Lord. Thereby living entities under a devotee's care get the opportunity for God realization by the management of a devotee-master.</div><A NAME="24091"></A><div class="Purport">Attachment for household paraphernalia and for Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a go poorly together. One attachment is the path of darkness, and the other attachment is the path of light. Where there is light, there is no darkness, and where there is darkness, there is no light. But an expert devotee can turn everything to the path of light by an attitude of service to the Lord, and the best example here is the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira and householders like him can turn everything to light by dovetailing so-called material assets in the service of the Lord, but one who is not trained or is unable to turn everything to the service of the Lord (<span class="Italic">nirbandha&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-sambandhe</span>) must give up all material connections before he can be fit to hear and chant the glories of the Lord, or in other words, one who has seriously heard <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> for even one day, like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, from a fit personality like &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, may be able to lose all affinity for material things.

Most people are attracted by such activities. Even in the activities of their modern godless civilization, people are more concerned with economic development and sense gratification without any religious sentiments. As a great emperor of the world, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it had to observe such regulations of the Vedic <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;&#299;ya</span> section, but by his slight association with &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; he could perfectly understand that Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Absolute Personality of Godhead (V&#257;sudeva), for whom he had a natural love since his birth, is everything, and thus he fixed his mind firmly upon Him, renouncing all modes of Vedic <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;&#299;ya</span> activities.

For every unknown thing, we have to learn and inquire from a learned personality. The question of creation is also one of such inquiries to be made to the right person. The spiritual master, therefore, must be one who is <span class="Italic">sama j&ntilde;a,</span> as stated hereinbefore in connection with &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;. Thus all inquiries on God which are unknown to the disciple may be made from the qualified spiritual master, and here the practical example is set by Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it. It was, however, already known to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it that everything we see is born out of the energy of the Lord, as we have all learned in the very beginning of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<span class="Italic">janm&#257;dy asya yata&#7717;</I> [SB </I><a href="index4dab.html?g=6120">1.1.1</a></I>]</span></I>). So Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it wanted to know the process of creation. The origin of creation was known to him; otherwise he would not have inquired how the Personality of Godhead, by His different energies, creates this phenomenal world. The common man also knows that the creation is made by some creator and is not created automatically. We have no experience in the practical world that a thing is created automatically. Foolish people say that the creative energy is independent and acts automatically, as electrical energy works. But the intelligent man knows that even the electrical energy is generated by an expert engineer in the localized powerhouse, and thus the energy is distributed everywhere under the resident engineer's supervision. The Lord's supervision in connection with creation is mentioned even in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index652d.html?g=3075">9.10</a>), and it is clearly said there that material energy is a manifestation of one of many such energies of the Supreme (<span class="Italic">par&#257;sya &#347;aktir vividhaiva &#347;r&#363;yate </I>[</I>Cc. Madhya </I><a href="index4653.html?g=113909">13.65</a>,</I> purport</I>]</span></I>). An inexperienced boy may be struck with wonder by seeing the impersonal actions of electronics or many other wonderful things conducted by electrical energy, but an experienced man knows that behind the action is a living man who creates such energy. Similarly the so-called scholars and philosophers of the world may, by mental speculation, present so many utopian theories about the impersonal creation of the universe, but an intelligent devotee of the Lord, by studying the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> can know that behind the creation is the hand of the Supreme Lord, just as in the generating electrical powerhouse there is the resident engineer. The research scholar finds out the cause and the effect of everything, but research scholars as great as Brahm&#257;, &#346;iva, Indra and many other demigods are sometimes bewildered by seeing the wonderful creative energy of the Lord, so what to speak of the tiny mundane scholars dealing in petty things. As there are differences in the living conditions of different planets of the universe, and as one planet is superior to others, the brains of the living entities in those respective planets are also of different categorical values. As stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> one can compare the long duration of life of the inhabitants of Brahm&#257;'s planet, which is inconceivable to the inhabitants of this planet earth, to the categorical value of the brain of Brahm&#257;j&#299;, also inconceivable to any great scientist of this planet. And with such high brain power, even Brahm&#257;j&#299; has described in his great <span class="Italic">sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bs.</span> 5.1) as follows:</div><A NAME="24157"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">&#299;&#347;vara&#7717; parama&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&#7717;<br>sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha&#7717;<br>an&#257;dir &#257;dir govinda&#7717;<br>sarva-k&#257;ra&#7751;a-k&#257;ra&#7751;am</div></div><A NAME="24158"></A><div class="After-Verse">"There are many personalities possessing the qualities of Bhagav&#257;n, but K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the supreme because none can excel Him.

But persons with tiny brains within this petty planet earth think of the Lord as one of them. Thus when the Lord says in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> that He (Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a) is all in all, the speculative philosophers and the mundane wranglers deride Him, and the Lord regretfully says:</div><A NAME="24160"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">avaj&#257;nanti m&#257;&#7745; m&#363;&#7693;h&#257;<br>m&#257;nu&#7779;&#299;&#7745; tanum &#257;&#347;ritam<br>para&#7745; bh&#257;vam aj&#257;nanto<br>mama bh&#363;ta-mahe&#347;varam</div></div><A NAME="24161"></A><div class="After-Verse">"Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form.

(Bg. <a href="indexa12b.html?g=3084">9.11</a>) Brahm&#257; and &#346;iva (and what to speak of other demigods) are <span class="Italic">bh&#363;tas,</span> or powerful created demigods who manage universal affairs, much like ministers appointed by a king. The ministers may be <span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;varas,</span> or controllers, but the Supreme Lord is <span class="Italic">mahe&#347;vara,</span> or the creator of the controllers. Persons with a poor fund of knowledge do not know this, and therefore they have the audacity to deride Him because He comes before us by His causeless mercy occasionally as a human being. The Lord is not like a human being. He is <span class="Italic">sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha</span><I> <span class="Italic"></I>[Bs.</I> </span>5.1</I>]<span class="Italic"></I>,</span> or the Absolute Personality of Godhead, and there is no difference between His body and His soul. He is both the power and the powerful.</div><A NAME="24162"></A><div class="Purport">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it did not ask his spiritual master, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, to narrate Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's pastimes in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana; he wanted to hear first about the creation of the Lord. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; did not say that the King should hear about the direct transcendental pastimes of the Lord. The time was very short, and naturally &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; could have gone directly to the Tenth Canto to make a shortcut of the whole thing, as generally done by the professional reciters. But neither the King nor the great speaker of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> jumped up like the organizers of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam;</span> both of them proceeded systematically, so that both future readers and hearers might take lessons from the example of the procedure of reciting <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> Those who are in control of the external energy of the Lord, or in other words those who are in the material world, must first of all know how the external energy of the Lord is working under the direction of the Supreme Personality, and afterwards one may try to enter into the activities of His internal energy. The mundaners are mostly worshipers of Durg&#257;-dev&#299;, the external energy of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, but they do not know that Durg&#257;-dev&#299; is but the shadow energy of the Lord. Behind her astonishing display of material workings is the direction of the Lord, as confirmed in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index652d.html?g=3075">9.10</a>). The <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> affirms that Durg&#257;-&#347;akti is working by the direction of Govinda, and without His sanction the powerful Durg&#257;-&#347;akti cannot move even a blade of grass. Therefore the neophyte devotee, instead of jumping at once to the platform of transcendental pastimes presented by the internal energy of the Lord, may know how great the Supreme Lord is by inquiring about the process of His creative energy. In the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta</span> also, descriptions of the creative energy and the Lord's hand in it are explained, and the author of <span class="Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta</span> has warned the neophyte devotees to be seriously on guard against the pitfall of neglecting knowledge about K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in regard to how great He is. Only when one knows Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's greatness can one firmly put one's unflinching faith in Him; otherwise, like the common man, even the great leaders of men will mistake Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a for one of the many demigods, or a historical personality, or a myth only. The transcendental pastimes of the Lord in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, or even at Dv&#257;rak&#257;, are relishable for persons who have already qualified themselves in advanced spiritual techniques, and the common man may be able to attain to such a plane by the gradual process of service and inquiries, as we shall see in the behavior of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

So all living entities, both in the conditioned state and in the liberated state, are maintained by the Almighty Supreme Lord. Such maintenance is effected by the Lord through His different expansions of Self and three principal energies, namely the internal, external and marginal energies.

And there are innumerable universes, and all of them aggregated together are known as the created material world. And this part of His creation is only a fractional portion of the complete creation. The material world stands as a part only (<span class="Italic">ek&#257;&#7745;&#347;ena sthito jagat </I>[</I>Bg. <a href="index2334.html?g=3663">10.42</a></I>]</span></I>). Supposing that the material world is a display of one part of His energy, the remaining three parts consist of the <span class="Italic">vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha jagat</span> or spiritual world described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as <span class="Italic">mad-dh&#257;ma</span> or <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana-dh&#257;ma,</span> or the eternal world. We have marked in the previous verse that He creates and again winds up the creation. This action is applicable only in the material world because the other, greater part of His creation, namely the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha world, is neither created nor annihilated; otherwise the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha-dh&#257;ma would not have been called eternal. The Lord exists with <span class="Italic">dh&#257;ma;</span> His eternal name, quality, pastimes, entourage and personality are all a display of His different energies and expansions. The Lord is called <span class="Italic">an&#257;di,</span> or having no creator, and <span class="Italic">&#257;di,</span> or the origin of all. We think in our own imperfect way that the Lord is also created, but the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta</span> informs us that He is not created. Rather, everything else is created by Him (<span class="Italic">n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a&#7717; paro 'vyakt&#257;t</span>). Therefore, for the common man these are all very wonderful matters for consideration. Even for great scholars they are inconceivable, and thus such scholars present theories contradictory to one another. Even for the insignificant part of His creation, this particular universe, they have no complete information as to how far this limited space extends, or how many stars and planets are there, or the different conditions of those innumerable planets. Modern scientists have insufficient knowledge of all this. Some of them assert that there are one hundred million planets scattered all over space. In a news release from Moscow dated 2/21/60, the following piece of knowledge was relayed:</div><A NAME="24193"></A><div class="Purport">"Russia's well-known professor of astronomy Boris Vorontsov-Veliaminov said that there must be an infinite number of planets in the universe inhabited by beings endowed with reason.</div><A NAME="24194"></A><div class="Purport">"It could be that life similar to that on earth flourishes on such planets.</div><A NAME="24195"></A><div class="Purport">"Doctor of Chemistry Nikolai Zhirov, covering the problem of atmosphere on other planets, pointed out that the organism of a Martian, for instance, could very well adapt itself to normal existence with a low body temperature.</div><A NAME="24196"></A><div class="Purport">"He said that he felt that the gaseous composition of Martian atmosphere was quite suitable to sustain life of beings which have become adapted to it."</div><A NAME="24197"></A><div class="Purport">This adaptability of an organism to different varieties of planets is described in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> as <span class="Italic">vibh&#363;ti-bhinnam;</span> i.e., each and every one of the innumerable planets within the universe is endowed with a particular type of atmosphere, and the living beings there are more perfectly advanced in science and psychology because of a better atmosphere. <span class="Italic">Vibh&#363;ti</span> means "specific powers," and <span class="Italic">bhinnam</span> means "variegated." Scientists who are attempting to explore outer space and are trying to reach other planets by mechanical arrangements must know for certain that organisms adapted to the atmosphere of earth cannot exist in the atmospheres of other planets (<span class="Italic">Easy Journey to Other planets</span>). One has to prepare himself, therefore, to be transferred to a different planet after being relieved of the present body, as it is said in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index0567.html?g=3210">9.25</a>):</div><A NAME="24198"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">y&#257;nti deva-vrat&#257; dev&#257;n<br>pit&#7773;n y&#257;nti pit&#7771;-vrat&#257;&#7717;<br>bh&#363;t&#257;ni y&#257;nti bh&#363;tejy&#257;<br>y&#257;nti mad-y&#257;jino 'pi m&#257;m</div></div><A NAME="24199"></A><div class="After-Verse">"Those who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods, those who worship ghosts and spirits will take birth among such beings, and those who worship Me will live with Me."</div><A NAME="24200"></A><div class="Purport">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it's statement regarding the workings of the creative energy of the Lord discloses that he knew everything of the process of creation.

Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, being a great emperor, a descendant of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas and a great devotee of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, was quite able to know considerably about the creation of the world, but that much knowledge was not sufficient. He said therefore that even greatly learned scholars fail to know about that, even after great effort. The Lord is unlimited, and His activities are also unfathomed. With a limited source of knowledge and with imperfect senses, any living being, up to the standard of Brahm&#257;j&#299;, the highest perfect living being within the universe, can never imagine knowing about the unlimited. We can know something of the unlimited when it is explained by the unlimited, as has been done by the Lord Himself in the unique statements of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> and it can also be known to some extent from realized souls like &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, who learned it from Vy&#257;sadeva, a disciple of N&#257;rada, and thus the perfect knowledge can descend by the chain of disciplic succession only, and not by any form of experimental knowledge, old or modern.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

He is very difficult to know simply by learning the transcendental science of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> but He is very easily realized by His pure devotees.</div><A NAME="24227"></A><div class="Purport">The expansions of different forms of the Lord, as from K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a to Baladeva to Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a, from Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a to V&#257;sudeva, from V&#257;sudeva to Aniruddha, from Aniruddha to Pradyumna and then again to second Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a and from Him to the N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;&#257;vat&#257;ras,</span> and innumerable other forms, which are compared to the constant flowing of the uncountable waves of a river, are all one and the same. They are like lamps of equal power which kindle from one lamp to another. That is the transcendental potency of the Lord. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> say that He is so complete that even though the whole complete identity emanates from Him, He still remains the same complete whole (<span class="Italic">p&#363;r&#7751;asya p&#363;r&#7751;am &#257;d&#257;ya p&#363;r&#7751;am ev&#257;va&#347;i&#7779;yate </I>[</I>Iso</span> Invocation</I>]</I>). As such, there is no validity in a material conception of the Lord produced by the mental speculator. Thus He remains always a mystery for the mundane scholar, even if he is vastly learned in the Vedic literatures (<span class="Italic">vede&#7779;u durlabham adurlabham &#257;tma-bhaktau</I> [Bs. </span></I>5.33]). Therefore, the Lord is beyond the limit of conception for mundane learned scholars, philosophers or scientists. He is easily understandable for the pure devotee because the Lord declares in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexc2a1.html?g=5889">18.54</a>) that after surpassing the stage of knowledge, when one is able to be engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, then only can one know the true nature of the Lord. One cannot have any clear conception of the Lord or His holy name, form, attributes, pastimes, etc., unless one is engaged in His transcendental loving service. The statement of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> that one must first of all surrender unto the Lord, being freed from all other engagements, means that one must become a pure, unconditional devotee of the Lord. Only then can one know Him by the strength of devotional service.</div><A NAME="24228"></A><div class="Purport">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it admitted in the previous verse that the Lord is inconceivable even for the greatest learned scholars. Why then should he again request &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; to clarify his insufficient knowledge about the Lord? The reason is clear. Not only was &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; vastly learned in the Vedic literatures, but he was also a great self-realized soul and a powerful devotee of the Lord. A powerful devotee of the Lord is, by the grace of the Lord, more than the Lord Himself. The Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; R&#257;macandra attempted to bridge the Indian Ocean to reach the island of La&#7749;k&#257;, but &#346;r&#299; Hanum&#257;nj&#299;, the unalloyed devotee of the Personality of Godhead, could cross the ocean simply by jumping over it. The Lord is so merciful upon His pure devotee that He presents His beloved devotee as more powerful than Himself. The Lord expressed Himself to be unable to save Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni, although the Muni was so powerful that he could reach the Lord directly under material conditions. But Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni was saved by Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ambar&#299;&#7779;a, a devotee of the Lord. Therefore, not only is a devotee of the Lord more powerful than the Lord, but also worship of the devotee is considered more effective than direct worship of the Lord (<span class="Italic">mad-bhakta-p&#363;j&#257;bhyadhik&#257;</I> [SB </span></I>11.19.21]).</div><A NAME="24229"></A><div class="Purport">The conclusion is, therefore, that a serious devotee must first approach a spiritual master who not only is well versed in the Vedic literatures but is also a great devotee with factual realization of the Lord and His different energies. Without the help of such a devotee spiritual master, one cannot make progress in the transcendental science of the Lord. And a bona fide spiritual master like &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; does not speak about the Lord only in the matter of His internal potencies, but also explains how He associates with His external potencies.</div><A NAME="24230"></A><div class="Purport">The Lord's pastimes in the internal potency are displayed in His activities in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, but His external potential works are directed in His features of K&#257;ra&#7751;&#257;r&#7751;ava&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and K&#7779;&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; offers his good counsel to the interested Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas when he says that they should not be interested in hearing only about the Lord's activities (like <span class="Italic">r&#257;sa-l&#299;l&#257;</span>), but must be keenly interested in His pastimes in His features of the <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;&#257;vat&#257;ras</span> in connection with <span class="Italic">s&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;i-tattva,</span> creational functions, following the examples of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, the ideal disciple, and &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, the ideal spiritual master.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

As stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> there are two kinds of nature (<span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti</span>), namely the material nature and the spiritual nature, or the external and internal potencies of the Lord. The material nature is called <span class="Italic">apar&#257;,</span> or inferior, and the spiritual nature is called superior or transcendental. Therefore the form of the Lord is not of the inferior, material nature. He is complete transcendence. And He is <span class="Italic">m&#363;rti,</span> or having transcendental form. The less intelligent men, who are unaware of His transcendental form, describe Him as impersonal Brahman. But Brahman is simply the rays of His transcendental body (<span class="Italic">yasya prabh&#257;</I> [Bs. </span></I>5.40]). The devotees, who are aware of His transcendental form, render Him service; therefore the Lord also reciprocates by His causeless mercy and thus delivers His devotees from all distresses. The pious men who follow the rulings of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are also dear to Him, and therefore the pious men of this world are also protected by Him. The impious and the nondevotees are against the principles of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> and so such persons are always hampered from making advances in their nefarious activities. Some of them, who are specially favored by the Lord, are killed by Him personally, as in the cases of R&#257;va&#7751;a, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu and Ka&#7745;sa, and thus such demons get salvation and are thereby checked from further progress in their demoniac activities.

Even the very sound of the holy name of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a or R&#257;ma can at once surcharge the atmosphere spiritually. We must know definitely that the Lord is present wherever such pure transcendental service is performed, and thus the performer of offenseless <span class="Italic">k&#299;rtanam</span> has positive association with the Lord. Similarly, remembrance and prayers also can give us the desired result if they are properly done under expert guidance. One should not concoct forms of devotional service. One may worship the form of the Lord in a temple, or one may impersonally offer the Lord devotional prayers in a mosque or a church. One is sure to get free from the reactions of sins provided one is very careful about not committing sins willingly in expectation of getting free from the reactions of sins by worshiping in the temple or by offering prayers in the church. This mentality of committing sins willfully on the strength of devotional service is called <span class="Italic">n&#257;mno bal&#257;d yasya hi p&#257;pa-buddhi&#7717;,</span> and it is the greatest offense in the discharge of devotional service.

Do not worry any more."</div><A NAME="24334"></A><div class="Purport">Persons who are intelligent take serious notice of this last instruction of the Lord. Knowledge of the self is the first step in spiritual realization, which is called confidential knowledge, and a step further is God realization, which is called more confidential knowledge. The culmination of the knowledge of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> is God realization, and when one attains this stage of God realization, he naturally, voluntarily becomes a devotee of the Lord to render Him loving transcendental service. This devotional service to the Lord is always based on love of God and is distinct from the nature of routine service as prescribed in <span class="Italic">karma-yoga, j&ntilde;&#257;na-yoga</span> or <span class="Italic">dhy&#257;na-yoga.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> there are different instructions for such men of different categories, and there are various descriptions for <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma, sanny&#257;sa-dharma, yati-dharma,</span> the renounced order of life, controlling the senses, meditation, perfection of mystic powers, etc., but one who fully surrenders unto the Lord to render service unto Him, out of spontaneous love for Him, factually assimilates the essence of all knowledge described in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> One who adopts this method very skillfully attains perfection of life at once. And this perfection of human life is called <span class="Italic">brahma-gati,</span> or the progressive march in spiritual existence. As enunciated by &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; on the basis of Vedic assurances, <span class="Italic">brahma-gati</span> means to attain a spiritual form as good as that of the Lord, and in that form the liberated living being eternally lives on one of the spiritual planets situated in the spiritual sky. Attainment of this perfection of life is easily available to a pure devotee of the Lord without his undergoing any difficult method of perfection. Such a devotional life is full of <span class="Italic">k&#299;rtanam, smara&#7751;am, &#299;k&#7779;a&#7751;am,</span> etc., as mentioned in the previous verse. One must therefore adopt this simple way of devotional life in order to attain the highest perfection available in any category of the human form of life in any part of the world.

Without such dovetailing, all such qualities become sources of trouble for people in general. Everything can be utilized either for one's own sense gratification or in the service of one other than oneself. There are two kinds of self-interest also, namely personal selfishness and extended selfishness. But there is no qualitative difference between personal and extended selfishness. Theft for personal interest or for the family interest is of the same quality-namely, criminal. A thief pleading not guilty because of committing theft not for personal interest but for the interest of society or country has never been excused by the established law of any country. People in general have no knowledge that the self-interest of a living being attains perfection only when such an interest coincides with the interest of the Lord. For example, what is the interest of maintaining body and soul together? One earns money for maintenance of the body (personal or social), but unless there is God consciousness, unless the body is being properly maintained to realize one's relation with God, all good efforts to maintain body and soul together are similar to the attempts of the animals to maintain body and soul together. The purpose of maintaining the human body is different from that of the animals. Similarly, advancement of learning, economic development, philosophical research, study in the Vedic literature or even the execution of pious activities (like charity, opening of hospitals, and the distribution of food grains) should be done in relation with the Lord. The aim of all such acts and endeavors must be the pleasure of the Lord and not the satisfaction of any other identity, individual or collective (<span class="Italic">sa&#7745;siddhir hari-to&#7779;a&#7751;am</I> [SB </I><a href="index135e.html?g=6442">1.2.13</a></I>]</span></I>). In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index0526.html?g=3228">9.27</a>) the same principle is confirmed where it is said that whatever we may give in charity and whatever we may observe in austerity must be given over to the Lord or be done on His account only. The expert leaders of a godless human civilization cannot bring about a fruitful result in all their different attempts at educational advancement or economic development unless they are God conscious. And to become God conscious one has to hear about the all-auspicious Lord, as He is described in literature like the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span></div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The Greeks are known as Pulindas, and it is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Vana-parva</span> of <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> that the non-Vedic race of this part of the world would rule over the world. This Pulinda province was also one of the provinces of Bh&#257;rata, and the inhabitants were classified amongst the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> kings. But later on, due to their giving up the brahminical culture, they were mentioned as <span class="Italic">mlecchas</span> (just as those who are not followers of the Islamic culture are called <span class="Italic">kafirs</span> and those who are not followers of the Christian culture are called heathens).</div><A NAME="24369"></A><div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">&#256;bh&#299;ra:</span> This name also appears in the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata,</span> both in the <span class="Italic">Sabh&#257;-parva</span> and <span class="Italic">Bh&#299;&#7779;ma-parva.</span> It is mentioned that this province was situated on the River Sarasvat&#299; in Sind. The modern Sind province formerly extended on the other side of the Arabian Sea, and all the inhabitants of that province were known as the &#256;bh&#299;ras. They were under the domination of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, and according to the statements of M&#257;rka&#7751;&#7693;eya the <span class="Italic">mlecchas</span> of this part of the world would also rule over Bh&#257;rata. Later on this proved to be true, as in the case of the Pulindas. On behalf of the Pulindas, Alexander the Great conquered India, and on behalf of the &#256;bh&#299;ras, Muhammad Ghori conquered India. These &#256;bh&#299;ras were also formerly <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> within the brahminical culture, but they gave up the connection. The <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> who were afraid of Para&#347;ur&#257;ma and had hidden themselves in the Caucasian hilly regions later on became known as the &#256;bh&#299;ras, and the place they inhabited was known as &#256;bh&#299;rade&#347;a.</div><A NAME="24370"></A><div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">&#346;umbhas</span> or <span class="Italic">Ka&#7749;kas:</span> The inhabitants of the Ka&#7749;ka province of old Bh&#257;rata, mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata.</span></div><A NAME="24371"></A><div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Yavanas:</span> Yavana was the name of one of the sons of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yay&#257;ti who was given the part of the world known as Turkey to rule.

The Yavanas were therefore <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas,</span> and later on, by giving up the brahminical culture, they became <span class="Italic">mleccha-yavanas.</span> Descriptions of the Yavanas are in the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic"></B>&#256;di-parva</span></B> 85.34). Another prince called Turvasu was also known as Yavana, and his country was conquered by Sahadeva, one of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas.

As such, the Khasa are the Mongolians, the Chinese and others who are so designated.</div><A NAME="24373"></A><div class="Purport">The above-mentioned historical names are different nations of the world. Even those who are constantly engaged in sinful acts are all corrigible to the standard of perfect human beings if they take shelter of the devotees of the Lord. Jesus Christ and Muhammad, two powerful devotees of the Lord, have done tremendous service on behalf of the Lord on the surface of the globe. And from the version of &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; it appears that instead of running a godless civilization in the present context of the world situation, if the leadership of world affairs is entrusted to the devotees of the Lord, for which a worldwide organization under the name and style of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness has already been started, then by the grace of the Almighty Lord there can be a thorough change of heart in human beings all over the world because the devotees of the Lord are able authorities to effect such a change by purifying the dust-worn minds of the people in general. The politicians of the world may remain in their respective positions because the pure devotees of the Lord are not interested in political leadership or diplomatic implications. The devotees are interested only in seeing that the people in general are not misguided by political propaganda and in seeing that the valuable life of a human being is not spoiled in following a type of civilization which is ultimately doomed. If the politicians, therefore, would be guided by the good counsel of the devotees, then certainly there would be a great change in the world situation by the purifying propaganda of the devotees, as shown by Lord Caitanya. As &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; began his prayer by discussing the word <span class="Italic">yat-k&#299;rtanam,</span> so also Lord Caitanya recommended that simply by glorifying the Lord's holy name, a tremendous change of heart can take place by which the complete misunderstanding between the human nations created by politicians can at once be extinguished. And after the extinction of the fire of misunderstanding, other profits will follow. The destination is to go back home, back to Godhead, as we have several times discussed in these pages.</div><A NAME="24374"></A><div class="Purport">According to the cult of devotion, generally known as the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava cult, there is no bar against anyone's advancing in the matter of God realization. A Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is powerful enough to turn into a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava even the Kir&#257;ta, etc., as above mentioned. In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index27a1.html?g=3273">9.32</a>) it is said by the Lord that there is no bar to becoming a devotee of the Lord (even for those who are lowborn, or women, <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> or <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas</span>), and by becoming a devotee everyone is eligible to return home, back to Godhead. The only qualification is that one take shelter of a pure devotee of the Lord who has thorough knowledge in the transcendental science of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (<span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span>). Anyone from any part of the world who becomes well conversant in the science of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a becomes a pure devotee and a spiritual master for the general mass of people and may reclaim them by purification of heart. Though a person be even the most sinful man, he can at once be purified by systematic contact with a pure Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. A Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, therefore, can accept a bona fide disciple from any part of the world without any consideration of caste and creed and promote him by regulative principles to the status of a pure Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava who is transcendental to brahminical culture. The system of caste, or <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma,</span> is no longer regular even amongst the so-called followers of the system. Nor is it now possible to reestablish the institutional function in the present context of social, political and economic revolution. Without any reference to the particular custom of a country, one can be accepted to the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava cult spiritually, and there is no hindrance in the transcendental process. So by the order of Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, the cult of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> or the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> can be preached all over the world, reclaiming all persons willing to accept the transcendental cult. Such cultural propaganda by the devotees will certainly be accepted by all persons who are reasonable and inquisitive, without any particular bias for the custom of the country. The Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava never accepts another Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava on the basis of birthright, just as he never thinks of the Deity of the Lord in a temple as an idol. And to remove all doubts in this connection, &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; has invoked the blessings of the Lord, who is all-powerful (<span class="Italic">prabhavi&#7779;&#7751;ave nama&#7717;</span>). As the all-powerful Lord accepts the humble service of His devotee in devotional activities of the <span class="Italic">arcana,</span> His form as the worshipable Deity in the temple, similarly the body of a pure Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava changes transcendentally at once when he gives himself up to the service of the Lord and is trained by a qualified Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. The injunction of Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava regulation in this connection runs as follows: <span class="Italic">arcye vi&#7779;&#7751;au &#347;il&#257;-dh&#299;r guru&#7779;u nara-matir vai&#7779;&#7751;ave j&#257;ti-buddhi&#7717; &#347;r&#299;-vi&#7779;&#7751;or n&#257;mni &#347;abda-s&#257;m&#257;nya-buddhi&#7717;,</span> etc. "One should not consider the Deity of the Lord as worshiped in the temple to be an idol, nor should one consider the authorized spiritual master an ordinary man. Nor should one consider a pure Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava to belong to a particular caste, etc." (<span class="Italic">Padma Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span>)</div><A NAME="24375"></A><div class="Purport">The conclusion is that the Lord, being all-powerful, can, under any and every circumstance, accept anyone from any part of the world, either personally or through His bona fide manifestation as the spiritual master. Lord Caitanya accepted many devotees from communities other than the var&#7751;&#257;&#347;ramites, and He Himself declared, to teach us, that He does not belong to any caste or social order of life, but that He is the eternal servant of the servant of the Lord who maintains the damsels of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana (Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a)</I> [<I>Cc.

Those who are on the path of self-realization are generally classified as <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s, j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s, yog&#299;s,</span> or devotees of the Lord. The <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s,</span> who are much attracted by the fruitive activities of the Vedic rituals, are called <span class="Italic">bhukti-k&#257;m&#299;,</span> or those who desire material enjoyment.

The mystic <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s,</span> who practice different types of austerities for attainment of eight kinds of material perfection and who ultimately meet the Supersoul (Param&#257;tm&#257;) in trance, are called <span class="Italic">siddhi-k&#257;m&#299;,</span> or those who desire the perfection of becoming finer than the finest, becoming heavier than the heaviest, getting everything desired, having control over everyone, creating everything liked, etc. All these are abilities of a powerful <span class="Italic">yog&#299;.</span> But the devotees of the Lord do not want anything like that for self-satisfaction. They want only to serve the Lord because the Lord is great and as living entities they are eternally subordinate parts and parcels of the Lord. This perfect realization of the self by the devotee helps him to become desireless, to desire nothing for his personal self, and thus the devotees are called <span class="Italic">ni&#7779;k&#257;m&#299;,</span> without any desire.

Lord Caitanya was a strict <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;,</span> so much so that He did not allow any woman to come near Him, not even to bow down and offer respects. He never even heard the prayers of the <span class="Italic">deva-d&#257;s&#299;s</span> offered in the temple of Jagann&#257;tha because a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> is forbidden to hear songs sung by the fair sex. Yet even in the rigid position of a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> He recommended the mode of worship preferred by the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana as the topmost loving service possible to be rendered to the Lord. And &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;&#7751;&#299; is the principal head of all such goddesses of fortune, and therefore She is the pleasure counterpart of the Lord and is nondifferent from K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div><A NAME="24408"></A><div class="Purport">In the Vedic rituals there are recommendations for performing different types of sacrifice in order to achieve the greatest benefit in life. Such benedictions as the results of performing great sacrifices are, after all, favors given by the goddess of fortune, and the Lord, being the husband or lover of the goddess of fortune, is factually the Lord of all sacrifices also. He is the final enjoyer of all kinds of <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a;</span> therefore Yaj&ntilde;a-pati is another name of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. It is recommended in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> that everything be done for the Yaj&ntilde;a-pati (<span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;&#257;rt&#257;t karma&#7751;a&#7717;</span>), for otherwise one's acts will be the cause of conditioning by the law of material nature. Those who are not freed from all misconceptions (<span class="Italic">vyal&#299;kam</span>) perform sacrifices to please the minor demigods, but the devotees of the Lord know very well that Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the supreme enjoyer of all performances of sacrifice; therefore they perform the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana-yaj&ntilde;a</span> (<span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;a&#7745; k&#299;rtana&#7745; vi&#7779;&#7751;o&#7717; </I>[SB </span></I><a href="indexda76.html?g=55355">7.5.23</a>]), which is especially recommended in this age of Kali. In Kali-yuga, performance of other types of sacrifice is not feasible due to insufficient arrangements and inexpert priesthood.</div><A NAME="24409"></A><div class="Purport">We have information from the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexd203.html?g=1122">3.10</a>-11) that Lord Brahm&#257;, after giving rebirth to the conditioned souls within the universe, instructed them to perform sacrifices and to lead a prosperous life. With such sacrificial performances the conditioned souls will never be in difficulty in keeping body and soul together. Ultimately they can purify their existence. They will find natural promotion into spiritual existence, the real identity of the living being. A conditioned soul should never give up the practice of sacrifice, charity and austerity, in any circumstances. The aim of all such sacrifices is to please the Yaj&ntilde;a-pati, the Personality of Godhead; therefore the Lord is also Praj&#257;-pati. According to the <span class="Italic">Ka&#7789;ha Upani&#7779;ad,</span> the one Lord is the leader of the innumerable living entities. The living entities are maintained by the Lord (<span class="Italic">eko bah&#363;n&#257;&#7745; yo vidadh&#257;ti k&#257;m&#257;n</span>). The Lord is therefore called the supreme Bh&#363;ta-bh&#7771;t, or maintainer of all living beings.</div><A NAME="24410"></A><div class="Purport">Living beings are proportionately endowed with intelligence in terms of their previous activities. All living beings are not equally endowed with the same quality of intelligence because behind such development of intelligence is the control of the Lord, as declared in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a>). As Param&#257;tm&#257;, Supersoul, the Lord is living in everyone's heart, and from Him only does one's power of remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness follow (<span class="Italic">matta&#7717; sm&#7771;tir j&ntilde;&#257;nam apohana&#7745; ca</span>). One person can sharply remember past activities by the grace of the Lord while others cannot. One is highly intelligent by the grace of the Lord, and one is a fool by the same control. Therefore the Lord is Dhiy&#257;m-pati, or the Lord of intelligence.</div><A NAME="24411"></A><div class="Purport">The conditioned souls strive to become lords of the material world. Everyone is trying to lord it over the material nature by applying his highest degree of intelligence. This misuse of intelligence by the conditioned soul is called madness. One's full intelligence should be applied to get free from the material clutches. But the conditioned soul, due to madness only, engages his full energy and intelligence in sense gratification, and to achieve this end of life he willfully commits all sorts of misdeeds. The result is that instead of attaining an unconditional life of full freedom, the mad conditioned soul is entangled again and again in different types of bondage in material bodies. Everything we see in the material manifestation is but the creation of the Lord. Therefore He is the real proprietor of everything in the universes. The conditioned soul can enjoy a fragment of this material creation under the control of the Lord, but not self-sufficiently. That is the instruction in the <span class="Italic">&#298;&#347;opani&#7779;ad.</span> One should be satisfied with things awarded by the Lord of the universe. It is out of madness only that one tries to encroach upon another's share of material possessions.</div><A NAME="24412"></A><div class="Purport">The Lord of the universe, out of His causeless mercy upon the conditioned souls, descends by His own energy (<span class="Italic">&#257;tma-m&#257;y&#257;</span>) to reestablish the eternal relation of the conditioned souls with Him. He instructs all to surrender unto Him instead of falsely claiming to be enjoyers for a certain limit under His control. When He so descends He proves how much greater is His ability to enjoy, and He exhibits His power of enjoyment by (for instance) marrying sixteen thousand wives at once. The conditioned soul is very proud of becoming the husband of even one wife, but the Lord laughs at this; the intelligent man can know who is the real husband. Factually, the Lord is the husband of all the women in His creation, but a conditioned soul under the control of the Lord feels proud to be the husband of one or two wives.</div><A NAME="24413"></A><div class="Purport">All these qualifications as the different types of <span class="Italic">pati</span> mentioned in this verse are meant for Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; has therefore especially mentioned the <span class="Italic">pati</span> and <span class="Italic">gati</span> of the Yadu dynasty. The members of the Yadu dynasty knew that Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is everything, and all of them intended to return to Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a after He had finished His transcendental pastimes on the earth. The Yadu dynasty was annihilated by the will of the Lord because its members had to return home with the Lord. The annihilation of the Yadu dynasty was a material show created by the Supreme Lord; otherwise the Lord and the members of the Yadu dynasty are all eternal associates. The Lord is therefore the guide of all devotees, and as such, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; offered Him due respects with love-laden feelings.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The pure devotee thinks himself fallen into the ocean of birth and death and incessantly prays to the Lord to lift him up. He only aspires to become a speck of transcendental dust at the lotus feet of the Lord. The pure devotee, by the grace of the Lord, absolutely loses all attraction for material enjoyment, and to keep free from contamination he always thinks of the lotus feet of the Lord.

So the comparison is very appropriate: without becoming a swan, or <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa,</span> one cannot enter into the network of the lotus feet of the Lord. As stated in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;,</span> the mental speculators, even by dint of learned scholarship, cannot even dream of the Absolute Truth by speculating over it for eternity. The Lord reserves the right of not being exposed to such mental speculators. And because they cannot enter into network stem of the lotus stem of the Lord, all material speculators differ in conclusions, and at the end they make a useless compromise by saying, "as many conclusions, as many ways," according to one's own inclination. (<span class="Italic">yath&#257;-rucam</span>). But the Lord is not like a shopkeeper trying to please all sorts of customers in the mental speculator exchange. The Lord is what He is, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, and He demands absolute surrender unto Him only. The pure devotee, however, by following the ways of previous <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas,</span> or authorities, can see the Supreme Lord through the transparent medium of a bona fide spiritual master (<span class="Italic">anupa&#347;yanti</span>).

Therefore there is no difference of conclusions amongst the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> regarding the Lord and the devotees.

The Lord, being the Lord of intelligence in everyone (even in the nondevotee), favors His devotee with proper intelligence so that automatically the pure devotee is enlightened with the factual truth about the Lord and His different energies. the Lord is revealed not by one's speculative power or by one's verbal jugglery over the Absolute Truth. Rather, He reveals Himself to a devotee when He is fully satisfied by the devotee's service attitude. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; is not a mental speculator or compromiser of the theory of "as many ways, as many conclusions."

A living being is sufficiently potent to possess knowledge from the Lord in the proportion of fifty sixty-fourths, or seventy-eight percent of the full knowledge acquirable. Since the living being is constitutionally part and parcel of the Lord, he is unable to assimilate all the knowledge that the Lord possesses Himself. In the conditioned state, the living being is subject to forget everything after a change of body known as death. This potent knowledge is again inspired by the Lord from within the heart of every living being, and it is known as the awakening of knowledge, for it is comparable to awakening from sleep or unconsciousness. This awakening of knowledge is under the full control of the Lord, and therefore we find in the practical world different grades of knowledge in different persons. This awakening of knowledge is neither an automatic nor a material interaction. The supply source is the Lord Himself (<span class="Italic">dhiy&#257;&#7745; pati&#7717;</span>), for even Brahm&#257; is also subject to this regulation of the supreme creator. In the beginning of the creation, Brahm&#257; is born first without any father and mother because before Brahm&#257; there were no other living beings. Brahm&#257; is born from the lotus which grows from the abdomen of the Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and therefore he is known as Aja. This Brahm&#257;, or Aja, is also a living being, part and parcel of the Lord, but being the most pious devotee of the Lord, Brahm&#257; is inspired by the Lord to create, subsequent to the main creation by the Lord, through the agency of material nature. Therefore neither the material nature nor Brahm&#257; is independent of the Lord. The material scientists can merely observe the reactions of the material nature without understanding the direction behind such activities, as a child can see the action of electricity without any knowledge of the powerhouse engineer. This imperfect knowledge of the material scientist is due to a poor fund of knowledge. The Vedic knowledge was therefore first impregnated within Brahm&#257;, and it appears that Brahm&#257; distributed the Vedic knowledge. Brahm&#257; is undoubtedly the speaker of the Vedic knowledge, but actually he was inspired by the Lord to receive such transcendental knowledge, as it directly descends from the Lord. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are therefore called <span class="Italic">apauru&#7779;eya,</span> or not imparted by any created being. Before the creation the Lord was there (<span class="Italic">n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a&#7717; paro 'vyakt&#257;t</span>), and therefore the words spoken by the Lord are vibrations of transcendental sound. There is a gulf of difference between the two qualities of sound, namely <span class="Italic">pr&#257;k&#7771;ta</span> and <span class="Italic">apr&#257;k&#7771;ta.</span> The physicist can deal only with the <span class="Italic">pr&#257;k&#7771;ta</span> sound, or sound vibrated in the material sky, and therefore we must know that the Vedic sounds recorded in symbolic expressions cannot be understood by anyone within the universe unless and until one is inspired by the vibration of supernatural (<span class="Italic">apr&#257;k&#7771;ta</span>) sound, which descends in the chain of disciplic succession from the Lord to Brahm&#257;, from Brahm&#257; to N&#257;rada, from N&#257;rada to Vy&#257;sa and so on. No mundane scholar can translate or reveal the true import of the Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras</span> (hymns). They cannot be understood unless one is inspired or initiated by the authorized spiritual master.

The devotee always thinks of himself as instrumental for anything successfully carried out, and he declines to take credit for anything done by himself. The godless atheist wants to take all credit for activities, not knowing that even a blade of grass cannot move without the sanction of the Supreme Spirit, the Personality of Godhead. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; therefore wants to move by the direction of the Supreme Lord, who inspired Brahm&#257; to speak the Vedic wisdom. The truths described in the Vedic literatures are not theories of mundane imagination, nor are they fictitious, as the less intelligent class of men sometimes think. The Vedic truths are all perfect descriptions of the factual truth without any mistake or illusion, and &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; wants to present the truths of creation not as a metaphysical theory of philosophical speculation, but as the actual facts and figures of the subject, since he would be dictated to by the Lord exactly in the same manner as Brahm&#257;j&#299; was inspired. As stated in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a>), the Lord is Himself the father of the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta</span> knowledge, and it is He only who knows the factual purport of the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta</span> philosophy. So there is no greater truth than the principles of religion mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> Such Vedic knowledge or religion is disseminated by authorities like &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; because he is a humble devotional servitor of the Lord who has no desire to become a self-appointed interpreter without authority. That is the way of explaining the Vedic knowledge, technically known as the <span class="Italic">parampar&#257;</span> system, or descending process.</div><A NAME="24461"></A><div class="Purport">The intelligent man can see without mistake that any material creation (whether one's own body or a fruit or flower) cannot beautifully grow up without the spiritual touch. The greatest intelligent man of the world or the greatest man of science can present everything very beautifully only insofar as the spirit life is there or insomuch as the spiritual touch is there. Therefore the source of all truths is the Supreme Spirit, and not gross matter as wrongly conceived by the gross materialist. We get information from the Vedic literature that the Lord Himself first entered the vacuum of the material universe, and thus all things gradually developed one after another. Similarly, the Lord is situated as localized Param&#257;tm&#257; in every individual being; hence everything is done by Him very beautifully. The sixteen principal creative elements, namely earth, water, fire, air, sky, and the eleven sense organs, first developed from the Lord Himself and were thereby shared by the living entities. Thus the material elements were created for the enjoyment of the living entities. The beautiful arrangement behind all material manifestations is therefore made possible by the energy of the Lord, and the individual living entity can only pray to the Lord to understand it properly. Since the Lord is the supreme entity, different from &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, the prayer can be offered to Him. The Lord helps the living entity to enjoy material creation, but He is aloof from such false enjoyment. &#346;ukadeva prays for the mercy of the Lord, not only for being helped personally in presenting the truth, but also for helping others to whom he would like to speak.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Such music, dance and decorations enjoyed by the Lord are certainly not anything mundane, because the Lord is addressed in the very beginning as <span class="Italic">para,</span> or transcendental. This transcendental knowledge is unknown to the forgotten conditioned souls. &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva, who is the incarnation of the Lord, thus compiled the Vedic literatures to revive the lost memory of the conditioned souls about their eternal relation with the Lord. One should therefore try to understand the Vedic scriptures, or the nectar transferred by the Lord to His consorts in the conjugal humor, from the lotuslike mouth of Vy&#257;sadeva or &#346;ukadeva.

This long duration of life may not be believed by "the frog in the well," but persons who have a realization of the truths mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> accept the existence of a great personality who creates the variegatedness of the complete universe. It is understood from the revealed scriptures that the Brahm&#257;j&#299; of this universe is younger than all the other Brahm&#257;s in charge of the many, many universes beyond this, but none of them can be equal to the Personality of Godhead.</div><A NAME="24640"></A><div class="Purport">N&#257;radaj&#299; is one of the liberated souls, and after his liberation he was known as N&#257;rada; otherwise, before his liberation, he was simply a son of a maidservant. The questions may be asked why N&#257;radaj&#299; was not aware of the Supreme Lord and why he mis-conceived Brahm&#257;j&#299; to be the Supreme Lord, although factually he was not. A liberated soul is never bewildered by such a mistaken idea, so why did N&#257;radaj&#299; ask all those questions just like an ordinary man with a poor fund of knowledge? There was such bewilderment in Arjuna also, although he is eternally the associate of the Lord. Such bewilderment in Arjuna or in N&#257;rada takes place by the will of the Lord so that other, nonliberated persons may realize the real truth and knowledge of the Lord. The doubt arising in the mind of N&#257;rada about Brahm&#257;j&#299;'s becoming all-powerful is a lesson for the frogs in the well, that they may not be bewildered in misconceiving the identity of the Personality of Godhead (even by comparison to a personality like Brahm&#257;, so what to speak of ordinary men who falsely pose themselves as God or an incarnation of God). The Supreme Lord is always the Supreme, and as we have tried to establish many times in these purports, no living being, even up to the standard of Brahm&#257;, can claim to be one with the Lord. One should not be misled when people worship a great man as God after his death as a matter of hero worship. There were many kings like Lord R&#257;macandra, the King of Ayodhy&#257;, but none of them are mentioned as God in the revealed scriptures. To be a good king is not necessarily the qualification for being Lord R&#257;ma, but to be a great personality like K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the qualification for being the Personality of Godhead. If we scrutinize the characters who took part in the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra, we may find that Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira was no less a pious king than Lord R&#257;macandra, and by character study Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira was a better moralist than Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a asked Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira to lie, but Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira protested. But that does not mean that Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira could be equal to Lord R&#257;macandra or Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The great authorities have estimated Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira to be a pious man, but they have accepted Lord R&#257;ma or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as the Personality of Godhead. The Lord is therefore a different identity in all circumstances, and no idea of anthropomorphism can be applied to Him. The Lord is always the Lord, and a common living being can never be equal to Him.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

But N&#257;rada wanted to clear the matter by the statements of Brahm&#257;j&#299;, the supreme authority in the universe. As the decision of the supreme court of a state is final, similarly the judgment of Brahm&#257;j&#299;, the supreme authority in the universe, is final in the Vedic process of acquiring knowledge. As we have already affirmed in the previous verse, N&#257;radaj&#299; was a liberated soul; therefore, he was not one of the less intelligent men who accept a false god or gods in their own ways. He represented himself as less intelligent and yet intelligently presented a doubt to be cleared by the supreme authority so that the uninformed might take note of it and be rightly informed about the intricacies of the creation and the creator.</div><A NAME="24655"></A><div class="Purport">In this verse Brahm&#257;j&#299; clears up the wrong impression held by the less intelligent and affirms that he creates the universal variegatedness after the potential creation by the glaring effulgence of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Brahm&#257;j&#299; has also separately given this statement in the <span class="Italic">sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> known as the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span></B> (5.40), where he says:</div><A NAME="24656"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">yasya prabh&#257; prabhavato jagad-a&#7751;&#7693;a-ko&#7789;i-<br>ko&#7789;i&#7779;v a&#347;e&#7779;a-vasudh&#257;di-vibh&#363;ti-bhinnam<br>tad brahma ni&#7779;kalam anantam a&#347;e&#7779;a-bh&#363;ta&#7745;<br>govindam &#257;di-puru&#7779;a&#7745; tam aha&#7745; bhaj&#257;mi</div></div><A NAME="24657"></A><div class="After-Verse">"I serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead Govinda, the primeval Lord, whose transcendental bodily effulgence, known as the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti,</span> which is unlimited, unfathomed and all-pervasive, is the cause of the creation of unlimited numbers of planets, etc., with varieties of climates and specific conditions of life."</div><A NAME="24658"></A><div class="Purport">The same statement is in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index3746.html?g=4826">14.27</a>).

So the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> is not independent or self-sufficient. Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is ultimately the creator of the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti,</span> mentioned in this verse as <span class="Italic">sva-roci&#7779;&#257;,</span> or the effulgence of the transcendental body of the Lord. This <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> is all-pervading, and all creation is made possible by its potential power; therefore the Vedic hymns declare that everything that exists is being sustained by the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> (<span class="Italic">sarva&#7745; khalv ida&#7745; brahma</span>). Therefore the potential seed of all creation is the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti,</span> and the same <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti,</span> unlimited and unfathomed, is established by the Lord. Therefore the Lord (&#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a) is ultimately the supreme cause of all creation (<span class="Italic">aha&#7745; sarvasya prabhava&#7717; </I>[</I>Bg. </span><a href="index58fa.html?g=3360">10.8</a>]).</div><A NAME="24659"></A><div class="Purport"><JD:"Destination-394">One should not expect the Lord to create like a blacksmith with a hammer and other instruments.

Brahm&#257; cannot create the seeds, but he can manifest the seed into a tree, just as a gardener helps plants and orchards to grow by the watering process. The example cited here of the sun is very appropriate. In the material world the sun is the cause of all illumination: fire, electricity, the rays of the moon, etc. All luminaries in the sky are creations of the sun, the sun is the creation of the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti,</span> and the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> is the effulgence of the Lord.

Nonsensical talks are not supported by the principles of Vedic literatures, and first-grade nonsense talk is "It is I, it is mine." A godless civilization is exclusively conducted by such false ideas, and such persons, without any factual realization of God, accept a false God or falsely declare themselves to be God to mislead persons who are already bewildered by the deluding energy. Those who are before the Lord, however, and who surrender unto Him, cannot be influenced by the deluding energy; therefore they are free from the misconception of "It is I, it is mine," and therefore they do not accept a false God or pose themselves as equal to the Supreme Lord.

The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are made just to revive the forgotten consciousness of the conditioned souls, and any literature not meant for reviving God consciousness is rejected at once by the <span class="Italic">n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a-para</span> devotees. Such deluding books of knowledge, not having N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a as their aim, are not at all knowledge, but are the playgrounds for crows who are interested in the rejected refuse of the world. Any book of knowledge (science or art) must lead to the knowledge of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a; otherwise it must be rejected. That is the way of advancement of knowledge. The supreme worshipable Deity is N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. The demigods are recommended secondarily for worship in relation to N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a because the demigods are assisting hands in the management of the universal affairs. As the officers of a kingdom are respected due to their relation to the king, the demigods are worshiped due to their relation to the Lord. Without the Lord's relation, worship of the demigods is unauthorized (<span class="Italic">avidhi-p&#363;rvakam</span>), just as it is improper to water the leaves and branches of a tree without watering its root. Therefore the demigods are also dependent on N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. The <span class="Italic">lokas,</span> or different planets, are attractive because they have different varieties of life and bliss partially representing the <span class="Italic">sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha</span><I> <span class="Italic"></I>[Bs.</I> </span>5.1</I>]<span class="Italic"></I>.</span> Everyone wants the eternal life of bliss and knowledge. In the material world such an eternal life of bliss and knowledge is progressively realized in the upper planets, but after reaching there one is inclined to achieve further progress along the path back to Godhead. Duration of life, with a proportionate quantity of bliss and knowledge, may be increased from one planet to another. One can increase the duration of life to thousands and hundreds of thousands of years in different planets, but nowhere is there eternal life. But one who can reach the highest planet, that of Brahm&#257;, can aspire to reach the planets in the spiritual sky, where life is eternal. Therefore, the progressive journey from one planet to another culminates in reaching the supreme planet of the Lord (<span class="Italic">mad-dh&#257;ma</span>), where life is eternal and full of bliss and knowledge. All different kinds of sacrifice are performed just to satisfy Lord N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a with a view to reach Him, and the best sacrifice recommended in this age of Kali is <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana-yaj&ntilde;a,</span> the mainstay of the devotional service of a <span class="Italic">n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a-para</span> devotee.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

But ultimately both the systems are meant for realizing the impersonal Brahman, which is but a partial representation of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, the Personality of Godhead. As we have explained before, the impersonal Brahman effulgence is only a part of the Personality of Godhead. Impersonal Brahman is situated on the person of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and as such, Brahman is the glorification of the personality of the Godhead.

Two identities of soul, the Supersoul and the individual soul, are admitted to be in the living entity, even by the greatest authority of the universe. The Supersoul is the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, whereas the individual soul is the eternal servitor of the Lord. The Lord inspires the individual soul to create what is already created by the Lord, and by the good will of the Lord a discoverer of something in the world is accredited as the discoverer. It is said that Columbus discovered the Western Hemisphere, but actually the tract of land was not created by Columbus. The vast tract of land was already there by the omnipotency of the Supreme Lord, and Columbus, by dint of his past service unto the Lord, was blessed with the credit of discovering America. Similarly, no one can create anything without the sanction of the Lord, since everyone sees according to his ability. This ability is also awarded by the Lord according to one's willingness to render service unto the Lord. One must therefore be voluntarily willing to render service unto the Lord, and thus the Lord will empower the doer in proportion to his surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord. Lord Brahm&#257; is a great devotee of the Lord; therefore he has been empowered or inspired by the Lord to create such a universe as the one manifested before us. The Lord also inspired Arjuna to fight in the field of Kuruk&#7779;etra as follows:</div><A NAME="24747"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">tasm&#257;t tvam utti&#7779;&#7789;ha ya&#347;o labhasva<br>jitv&#257; &#347;atr&#363;n bhu&#7749;k&#7779;va r&#257;jya&#7745; sam&#7771;ddham<br>mayaivaite nihat&#257;&#7717; p&#363;rvam eva<br>nimitta-m&#257;tra&#7745; bhava savyas&#257;cin</div></div><A NAME="24748"></A><div class="VerseRef">(Bg. <a href="indexcd54.html?g=3944">11.33</a>)</div><A NAME="24749"></A><div class="After-Verse">The Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra, or any other battle at any place or at any time, is made by the will of the Lord, for no one can arrange such mass annihilation without the sanction of the Lord. The party of Duryodhana insulted Draupad&#299;, a great devotee of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and she appealed to the Lord as well as to all the silent observers of this unwarranted insult. Arjuna was then advised by the Lord to fight and take credit; otherwise the party of Duryodhana would be killed anyway by the will of the Lord. So Arjuna was advised just to become the agent and take the credit for killing great generals like Bh&#299;&#7779;ma and Kar&#7751;a.</div><A NAME="24750"></A><div class="Purport">In the Vedic writings such as the <span class="Italic">Ka&#7789;ha Upani&#7779;ad,</span> the Lord is described as the <span class="Italic">sarva-bh&#363;ta-antar&#257;tm&#257;,</span> or the Personality of Godhead who resides in everyone's body and who directs everything for one who is a soul surrendered unto Him. Those who are not surrendered souls are put under the care of the material nature (<span class="Italic">bhr&#257;mayan sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;ni yantr&#257;r&#363;&#7693;h&#257;ni m&#257;yay&#257;</I> [</I>Bg</I>. </span></I><a href="index0d72.html?g=5952">18.61</a><span class="Italic"></I>]</span></I>); therefore, they are allowed to do things on their own account and suffer the consequences themselves. Devotees like Brahm&#257; and Arjuna do not do anything on their own account, but as fully surrendered souls they always await indications from the Lord; therefore they attempt to do something which appears very wonderful to ordinary vision. One of the Lord's names is Urukrama, or one whose actions are very wonderful and are beyond the imagination of the living being, so the actions of His devotees sometimes appear very wonderful due to the direction of the Lord. Beginning from Brahm&#257;, the topmost intelligent living entity within the universe, down to the smallest ant, every living entity's intelligence is overseen by the Lord in His transcendental position as the witness of all actions. The subtle presence of the Lord is felt by the intelligent man who can study the psychic effects of thinking, feeling and willing.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Rather, they become subordinate to or controlled by such energy. Factually the Lord is eternally manifested by His internal potency or spiritual energy just like the sun and its rays in the clear sky, but at times He creates the material energy, as the sun creates a cloud in the clear sky.

The material creation is something like a cloud in the unlimited sky. The real sky is the spiritual sky, eternally filled with the rays of the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti,</span> and a portion of this unlimited sky is covered by the <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva</span> cloud of the material creation, in which the conditioned souls, who want to lord it against the will of the Lord, are put into play as they desire under the control of the Lord by the agency of His external energy. As the rainy season appears and disappears regularly, the creation takes place and is again annihilated under the control of the Lord, as confirmed in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexfa26.html?g=2904">8.19</a>). So the creation and annihilation of the material worlds is a regular action of the Lord just to allow the conditioned souls to play as they like and thereby create their own fate of being differently created again in terms of their independent desires at the time of annihilation. The creation, therefore, takes place at a historical date (as we are accustomed to think of everything which has a beginning in our tiny experience). The process of creation and annihilation is called <span class="Italic">an&#257;di,</span> or without reference to date regarding the time the creation first took place, because the duration of even a partial creation is 8,640,000,000 years. The law of creation is, however, as mentioned in the Vedic literatures, that it is created at certain intervals and is again annihilated by the will of the Lord. The whole material or even the spiritual creation is a manifestation of the energy of the Lord, just as the light and heat of a fire are different manifestations of the fire's energy. The Lord therefore exists in His impersonal form by such expansion of energy, and the complete creation rests on His impersonal feature. Nonetheless He keeps Himself distinct from such creation as the <span class="Italic">p&#363;r&#7751;am</span> (or complete), and so no one should wrongly think that His personal feature is not existent due to His impersonal unlimited expansions. The impersonal expansion is a manifestation of His energy, and He is always in His personal feature despite His innumerable unlimited expansions of impersonal energies (Bg. <a href="indexf36d.html?g=3030">9.5</a>-7). For human intelligence it is very difficult to conceive how the whole creation rests on His expansion of energy, but the Lord has given a very good example in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> It is said that although the air and the atoms rest within the huge expansion of the sky, which is like the resting reservoir of everything materially created, still the sky remains separate and unaffected. Similarly although the Supreme Lord maintains everything created by His expansion of energy, He always remains separate. This is accepted even by &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya, the great advocate of the impersonal form of the Absolute. He says <span class="Italic">n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a&#7717; paro 'vyakt&#257;t,</span> or N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a exists separately, apart from the impersonal creative energy. The whole creation thus merges within the body of transcendental N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a at the time of annihilation, and the creation emanates from His body again with the same unchanging categories of fate and individual nature. The individual living entities, being parts and parcels of the Lord, are sometimes described as <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;,</span> qualitatively one in spiritual constitution. But because such living entities are apt to be attracted to the material creation, actively and subjectively, they are therefore different from the Lord.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Brahm&#257; is the representation of the mode of passion, and Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is the representation of the mode of goodness, while the mode of ignorance is represented by Lord &#346;iva, the father of material activities. Material nature is called the mother, and the initiator for materialistic life is the father, Lord &#346;iva. All material creation by the living entities is therefore initiated by the mode of passion. With the advancement of the duration of life in a particular millennium, the different modes act by gradual development. In the age of Kali (when the mode of passion is most prominent) material activities of different varieties, in the name of advancement of human civilization, take place, and the living entities become more and more involved in forgetting their real identity-the spiritual nature. By a slight cultivation of the mode of goodness, a glimpse of spiritual nature is perceived, but due to the prominence of the mode of passion, the mode of goodness becomes adulterated. Therefore one cannot transcend the limits of the material modes, and therefore realization of the Lord, who is always transcendental to the modes of material nature, becomes very difficult for the living entities, even though prominently situated in the mode of goodness through cultivation of the various methods. In other words, the gross matters are <span class="Italic">adhibh&#363;tam,</span> their maintenance is <span class="Italic">adhidaivam,</span> and the initiator of material activities is called <span class="Italic">adhy&#257;tmam.</span> In the material world these three principles act as prominent features, namely as raw material, its regular supplies, and its use in different varieties of material creations for sense enjoyment by the bewildered entities.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

And this self-centered egoism of the materialistic living entities is the cause of their being conditioned by the other paraphernalia and continuing their bondage of material existence. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> this self-centered egoism is very nicely explained in the Seventh Chapter (verses 24 through 27). The self-centered impersonalist, without a clear conception of the Personality of Godhead, concludes in his own way that the Personality of Godhead takes a material shape from His original impersonal spiritual existence for a particular mission. And this misleading conception of the Supreme Lord by the self-centered impersonalist continues, even though he is seen to be very interested in the Vedic literatures such as the <span class="Italic">Brahma-s&#363;tras</span> and other highly intellectual sources of knowledge. This ignorance of the personal feature of the Lord is due simply to ignorance of the mixture of different modes. The impersonalist thus cannot conceive of the Lord's eternal spiritual form of eternal knowledge, bliss and existence. The reason is that the Lord reserves the right of not exposing Himself to the nondevotee who, even after a thorough study of literature like the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> remains an impersonalist simply by obstinacy. This obstinacy is due to the action of <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;,</span> a personal energy of the Lord that acts like an aide-de-camp by covering the vision of the obstinate impersonalist. Such a bewildered human being is described as <span class="Italic">m&#363;&#7693;ha,</span> or grossly ignorant, because he is unable to understand the transcendental form of the Lord as being unborn and unchangeable. If the Lord takes a form or material shape from His original impersonal feature, then it means that He is born and changeable from impersonal to personal. But He is not changeable. Nor does He ever take a new birth like a conditioned soul. The conditioned soul may take a form birth after birth due to his conditional existence in matter, but the self-centered impersonalists, by their gross ignorance, accept the Lord as one of them because of self-centered egoism, even after so-called advancement of knowledge in the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta.</span> The Lord, being situated in the heart of every individual living entity, knows very well the tendency of such conditioned souls in terms of past, present and future, but the bewildered conditioned soul hardly can know Him in His eternal form. By the will of the Lord, therefore, the impersonalist, even after knowing the Brahman and Param&#257;tm&#257; features of the Lord, remains ignorant of His eternal personal feature as ever-existent N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, transcendental to all material creation.</div><A NAME="24851"></A><div class="Purport">The cause of such gross ignorance is constant engagement by the materialistic man in the matter of artificially increasing material demands. To realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one has to purify the materialistic senses by devotional service. The mode of goodness, or the brahminical culture recommended in the Vedic literatures, is helpful to such spiritual realization, and thus the <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na-&#347;akti</span> stage of the conditioned soul is comparatively better than the other two stages, namely <span class="Italic">dravya-&#347;akti</span> and <span class="Italic">kriy&#257;-&#347;akti.</span> The whole material civilization is manifested by a huge accumulation of materials, or, in other words, raw materials for industrial purposes, and the industrial enterprises (<span class="Italic">kriy&#257;-&#347;akti</span>) are all due to gross ignorance of spiritual life.

This means that the false ego in the sum total form of <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva</span> is generated from the marginal potency of the Lord, and due to this false ego of lording it over the material creation, ingredients are generated for the false enjoyment of the living being. The living being is practically the dominating factor over the material elements as the enjoyer, though the background is the Supreme Lord. Factually, save and except the Lord, no one can be called the enjoyer, but the living entity falsely desires to become the enjoyer. This is the origin of false ego. When the bewildered living being desires this, the shadow elements are generated by the will of the Lord, and the living entities are allowed to run after them as after a phantasmagoria.</div><A NAME="24868"></A><div class="Purport">It is said that first the <span class="Italic">tan-m&#257;tr&#257;</span> sound is created and then the sky, and in this verse it is confirmed that actually it is so, but sound is the subtle form of the sky, and the distinction is like that between the seer and the seen. The sound is the representation of the actual object, as the sound produced speaking of the object gives an idea of the description of the object. Therefore sound is the subtle characteristic of the object. Similarly, sound representation of the Lord, in terms of His characteristics, is the complete form of the Lord, as was seen by Vasudeva and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Da&#347;aratha, the fathers of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and Lord R&#257;ma. The sound representation of the Lord is nondifferent from the Lord Himself because the Lord and His representation in sound are absolute knowledge. Lord Caitanya has instructed us that in the holy name of the Lord, as sound representation of the Lord, all the potencies of the Lord are invested. Thus one can immediately enjoy the association of the Lord by the pure vibration of the sound representation of His holy name, and the concept of the Lord is immediately manifested before the pure devotee. A pure devotee, therefore, is not aloof from the Lord even for a moment. The holy name of the Lord, as recommended in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span>-Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare Hare/ Hare R&#257;ma, Hare R&#257;ma, R&#257;ma R&#257;ma, Hare Hare-may therefore be constantly chanted by the devotee aspiring to be constantly in touch with the Supreme Lord. One who is thus able to associate with the Lord is sure to be delivered from the darkness of the created world, which is a product of false ego (<span class="Italic">tamasi m&#257; jyotir gama</span>).</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

When the air is transformed in course of time and nature's course, fire is generated, taking shape with the sense of touch and sound. Since fire is also transformed, there is a manifestation of water, full of juice and taste. As previously, it also has form and touch and is also full of sound. And water, being transformed from all variegatedness on earth, appears odorous and, as previously, becomes qualitatively full of juice, touch, sound and form respectively.</div><A NAME="24893"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="24894"></A><div class="First">The whole process of creation is an act of gradual evolution and development from one element to another, reaching up to the variegatedness of the earth as so many trees, plants, mountains, rivers, reptiles, birds, animals and varieties of human beings. The quality of sense perception is also evolutionary, namely generated from sound, then touch, and from touch to form. Taste and odor are also generated along with the gradual development of sky, air, fire, water and earth.

In the sky there is sound only, whereas in the air there are sound and touch. In the fire there are sound, touch and shape, and in the water there is taste also, along with the other perceptions, namely sound, touch and shape. In the earth, however, there are all the above-mentioned qualities with an extra development of odor also. Therefore on the earth there is a full display of variegatedness of life, which is originally started with the basic principle of air. Diseases of the body take place due to derangement of air within the earthly body of the living beings. Mental diseases result from special derangement of the air within the body, and as such, yogic exercise is especially beneficial to keep the air in order so that diseases of the body become almost nil by such exercises. When they are properly done the duration of life also increases, and one can have control over death also by such practices. A perfect <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> can have command over death and quit the body at the right moment, when he is competent to transfer himself to a suitable planet. The <span class="Italic">bhakti-yogi,</span> however, surpasses all the <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> because, by dint of his devotional service, he is promoted to the region beyond the material sky and is placed in one of the planets in the spiritual sky by the supreme will of the Lord, the controller of everything.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Manufacture of the "necessities of life" in factories and workshops, excessively prominent in the age of Kali, or in the age of the machine, is the summit stage of the quality of darkness. Such manufacturing enterprises by human society are in the mode of darkness because factually there is no necessity for the commodities manufactured. Human society primarily requires food for subsistence, shelter for sleeping, defense for protection, and commodities for satisfaction of the senses. The senses are the practical signs of life, as will be explained in the next verse. Human civilization is meant for purifying the senses, and objects of sense satisfaction should be supplied as much as absolutely required, but not for aggravating artificial sensory needs. Food, shelter, defense and sense gratification are all needs in material existence. Otherwise, in his pure, uncontaminated state of original life, the living entity has no such needs. The needs are therefore artificial, and in the pure state of life there are no such needs. As such, increasing the artificial needs, as is the standard of material civilization, or advancing the economic development of human society, is a sort of engagement in darkness, without knowledge. By such engagement, human energy is spoiled, because human energy is primarily meant for purifying the senses in order to engage them in satisfying the senses of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord, being the supreme possessor of spiritual senses, is the master of the senses, H&#7771;&#7779;&#299;ke&#347;a. <span class="Italic">H&#7771;&#7779;&#299;ka</span> means the senses, and <span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;a</span> means the master. The Lord is not the servant of the senses, or, in other words, He is not directed by the dictation of the senses, but the conditioned souls or the individual living entities <span class="Italic">are</span> servants of the senses. They are conducted by the direction or dictation of the senses, and therefore material civilization is a kind of engagement in sense gratification only. The standard of human civilization should be to cure the disease of sense gratification, and one can do this simply by becoming an agent for satisfying the spiritual senses of the Lord. The senses are never to be stopped in their engagements, but one should purify them by engaging them in the pure service of sense gratification of the master of the senses. This is the instruction of the whole <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> Arjuna wanted first of all to satisfy his own senses by his decision not to fight with his kinsmen and friends, but Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a taught him the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> just to purify Arjuna's decision for sense gratification. Therefore Arjuna agreed to satisfy the senses of the Lord, and thus he fought the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra, as the Lord desired.</div><A NAME="24911"></A><div class="Purport">The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> instruct us to get out of the existence of darkness and go forward on the path of light (<span class="Italic">tamasi m&#257; jyotir gama</span>). The path of light is therefore to satisfy the senses of the Lord. Misguided men, or less intelligent men, follow the path of self-realization without any attempt to satisfy the transcendental senses of the Lord by following the path shown by Arjuna and other devotees of the Lord. On the contrary, they artificially try to stop the activities of the senses (<span class="Italic">yoga</span> system), or they deny the transcendental senses of the Lord (<span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na</span> system). The devotees, however, are above the <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> and the <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s</span> because pure devotees do not deny the senses of the Lord; they want to satisfy the senses of the Lord. Only because of the darkness of ignorance do the <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s</span> deny the senses of the Lord and thus artificially try to control the activities of the diseased senses. In the diseased condition of the senses there is too much engagement of the senses in increasing material needs. When one comes to see the disadvantage of aggravating the sense activities, one is called a <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;,</span> and when one tries to stop the activities of the senses by the practice of yogic principles, he is called a <span class="Italic">yogi,</span> but when one is fully aware of the transcendental senses of the Lord and tries to satisfy His senses, one is called a devotee of the Lord. The devotees of the Lord do not try to deny the senses of the Lord, nor do they artificially stop the actions of the senses. But they do voluntarily engage the purified senses in the service of the master of the senses, as was done by Arjuna, thereby easily attaining the perfection of satisfying the Lord, the ultimate goal of all perfection.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The four divisions of human society, namely the intelligent class (the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span>), the administrative class (the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span>), the mercantile class (the <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas</span>), and the laborer class (the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span>), are all in different parts of the body of the Lord. As such, no one is different from the Lord. The mouth of the body and the legs of the body are nondifferent constitutionally, but the mouth or the head of the body is qualitatively more important than the legs. At the same time, the mouth, the legs, the arms and the thighs are all component parts of the body. These limbs of the body of the Lord are meant to serve the complete whole. The mouth is meant for speaking and eating, the arms are meant for the protection of the body, the legs are meant for carrying the body, and the waist of the body is meant for maintaining the body. The intelligent class in society, therefore, must speak on behalf of the body, as well as accept foodstuff to satisfy the hunger of the body. The hunger of the Lord is to accept the fruits of sacrifice. The <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> or the intelligent class, must be very expert in performing such sacrifices, and the subordinate classes must join in such sacrifices. To speak for the Supreme Lord means to glorify the Lord by means of propagating the knowledge of the Lord as it is, broadcasting the factual nature of the Lord and the factual position of all other parts of the whole body. The <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> therefore, are required to know the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> or the ultimate source of knowledge. <span class="Italic">Veda</span> means knowledge, and <span class="Italic">anta</span> means the end of it. According to <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> the Lord is the source of everything (<span class="Italic">aha&#7745; sarvasya prabhava&#7717; </I>[</I>Bg. </span><a href="index58fa.html?g=3360">10.8</a>]), and thus the end of all knowledge (<span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta</span>) is to know the Lord, to know our relationship with Him and to act according to that relationship only. The parts of the body are related to the body; similarly, the living being must know his relationship with the Lord. The human life is especially meant for this purpose, namely to know the factual relationship of every living being with the Supreme Lord. Without knowing this relationship, the human life is spoiled. The intelligent class of men, the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> are therefore especially responsible for broadcasting this knowledge of our relationship with the Lord and leading the general mass of people to the right path. The administrative class is meant for protecting the living beings so that they can serve this purpose; the mercantile class is meant for producing food grains and distributing them to the complete human society so that the whole population is given a chance to live comfortably and discharge the duties of human life. The mercantile class is also required to give protection to the cows in order to get sufficient milk and milk products, which alone can give the proper health and intelligence to maintain a civilization perfectly meant for knowledge of the ultimate truth. And the laborer class, who are neither intelligent nor powerful, can help by physical services to the other higher classes and thus be benefited by their cooperation. Therefore the universe is a complete unit in relationship with the Lord, and without this relationship with the Lord the whole human society is disturbed and is without any peace and prosperity.

The word <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana</span> is significant. This very idea of eternity is expressed in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexf5bb.html?g=2912">8.20</a>), where it is said that beyond the material creation is the spiritual sky, where everything is eternal. Sometimes Satyaloka, the planet in which Brahm&#257; resides, is also called Brahmaloka. But the Brahmaloka mentioned here is not the same as the Satyaloka planetary system. This Brahmaloka is eternal, whereas the Satyaloka planetary system is not eternal. And to distinguish between the two, the adjective <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana</span> has been used in this case. According to &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;, this Brahmaloka is the <span class="Italic">loka</span> or abode of Brahman, or the Supreme Lord. In the spiritual sky all the planets are as good as the Lord Himself. The Lord is all spirit, and His name, fame, glories, qualities, pastimes, etc., are all nondifferent from Him because He is absolute. As such, the planets in the kingdom of God are also nondifferent from Him. In those planets there is no difference between the body and the soul, nor is there any influence of time as we experience it in the material world. And in addition to there being no influence of time, the planets in, Brahmaloka, due to being spiritual, are never annihilated. All variegatedness in the spiritual planets is also one with the Lord, and therefore the Vedic aphorism <span class="Italic">ekam ev&#257;dvit&#299;yam</span> is fully realized in that <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana</span> atmosphere of spiritual variegatedness. This material world is only a shadow phantasmagoria of the spiritual kingdom of the Lord, and because it is a shadow it is never eternal; the variegatedness in the material world of duality (spirit and matter) cannot be compared to that of the spiritual world. Because of a poor fund of knowledge, less intelligent persons sometimes mistake the conditions of the shadow world to be equivalent to those of the spiritual world, and thus they mistake the Lord and His pastimes in the material world to be one with the conditioned souls and their activities. The Lord condemns such less intelligent persons in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexa12b.html?g=3084">9.11</a>):</div><A NAME="25043"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">avaj&#257;nanti m&#257;&#7745; m&#363;&#7693;h&#257;<br>m&#257;nu&#7779;&#299;&#7745; tanum &#257;&#347;ritam<br>para&#7745; bh&#257;vam aj&#257;nanto<br>mama bh&#363;ta-mahe&#347;varam</div></div><A NAME="25044"></A><div class="After-Verse">Whenever the Lord incarnates, He does so in His full internal potency (<span class="Italic">&#257;tma-m&#257;y&#257;</span>), and less intelligent persons mistake Him to be one of the material creations. &#346;r&#299;la &#346;r&#299;dhara Sv&#257;m&#299;, therefore, rightly commenting on this verse, says that the Brahmaloka mentioned here is Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha, the kingdom of God, which is <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana,</span> or eternal, and is therefore not exactly like the material creations described above.

It is said that His mouth is the generating center of all kinds of voices, and its controlling deity is the fire demigod. And His skin and other six layers of bodily construction are the representative generating centers of the seven kinds of Vedic hymns, like the G&#257;yatr&#299;. G&#257;yatr&#299; is the beginning of all Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras,</span> and it is explained in the first volume of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> Since the generating centers are the different parts of the universal form of the Lord, and since the form of the Lord is transcendental to the material creation, it is to be understood that the voice, the tongue, the skin, etc., suggest that the Lord in His transcendental form is not without them. The material voice, or the energy of taking in foodstuff, is generated originally from the Lord; such actions are but perverted reflections of the original reservoirs-the transcendental situation is not without spiritual variegatedness. In the spiritual world, all the perverted forms of material variegatedness are fully represented in their original spiritual identity. The only difference is that material activities are contaminated by the three modes of material nature, whereas the potencies in the spiritual world are all pure because they are engaged in the unalloyed transcendental loving service of the Lord. In the spiritual world, the Lord is the sublime enjoyer of everything, and the living entities there are all engaged in His transcendental loving service without any contamination of the modes of material nature. The activities in the spiritual world are without any of the inebrieties of the material world, but there is no question of impersonal voidness on the spiritual platform, as suggested by the impersonalists. Devotional service is defined in the <span class="Italic">N&#257;rada-pa&ntilde;car&#257;tra</span> as follows:</div><A NAME="25098"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">sarvop&#257;dhi-vinirmukta&#7745;<br>tat-paratvena nirmalam<br>h&#7771;&#7779;&#299;ke&#7751;a h&#7771;&#7779;&#299;ke&#347;a-<br>sevana&#7745; bhaktir ucyate<br></I> [</I>Cc. Madhya <a href="index663c.html?g=124289">19.170</a></I>]</I></div></div><A NAME="25099"></A><div class="After-Verse">Originally, since all the senses are produced of the Lord's reservoir of senses, the sensual activities of the material world are to be purified by the process of devotional service, and thus the perfection of life can be attained simply by purifying the present position of our material activities. And the purifying process begins from the stage of being liberated from the conception of different designations. Every living entity is engaged in some sort of service, either for the self, or for the family, or for the society, country, etc., but, unfortunately, all such services are rendered due to material attachment. The attachments of the material affinity may be simply changed to the service of the Lord, and thus the treatment of being freed from material attachment begins automatically. The process of liberation is therefore easier through devotional service than by any other methods, for in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index3958.html?g=4186">12.5</a>) it is said that one is subjected to various kinds of tribulations if one is impersonally attached: <span class="Italic">kle&#347;o 'dhikataras te&#7779;&#257;m avyakt&#257;sakta-cetas&#257;m.</span></div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The actions of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> are such that a powerful person, misled by the illusory, material energy, wrongly accepts himself as all in all and does not develop God consciousness. As such, the false sense of egoism (namely myself and mine) has become overly prominent in the world, and there is a hard struggle for existence in human society. The intelligent class of men, therefore, must admit the Lord as the ultimate source of all energies and thus pay tribute to the Lord for His good blessings. Simply by accepting the Lord as the supreme proprietor of everything, since He is actually so, one can achieve the highest perfection of life. Whatever a person may be in the estimation of the social order of things, if a person tries to reciprocate a feeling of love towards the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is satisfied with the blessings of the Lord, he will at once feel the highest peace of mind for which he is hankering life after life. Peace of mind, or in other words the healthy state of mind, can be achieved only when the mind is situated in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. The parts and parcels of the Lord are endowed with specific powers for rendering service unto the Lord, just as a big business magnate's sons are empowered with specific powers of administration. The obedient son of the father never goes against the will of the father and therefore passes life very peacefully in concurrence with the head of the family, the father. Similarly, the Lord being the father, all living beings should fully and satisfactorily discharge the duty and will of the father, as faithful sons. This very mentality will at once bring peace and prosperity to human society.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

One would cease to generate altogether if there were not, by the grace of the Lord, a coating, a pleasure-giving substance, on the surface of the generative organs. This substance gives a pleasure so intense that it counteracts fully the distress of family encumbrances. A person is so captivated by this pleasure-giving substance that he is not satisfied by begetting a single child, but increases the number of children, with great risk in regard to maintaining them, simply for this pleasure-giving substance. This pleasure-giving substance is not false, however, because it originates from the transcendental body of the Lord. In other words, the pleasure-giving substance is a reality, but it has taken on an aspect of pervertedness on account of material contamination. In the material world, sex life is the cause of many distresses on account of material contact. Therefore, the sex life in the material world should not be encouraged beyond the necessity. There is a necessity for generating progeny even in the material world, but such generation of children must be carried out with full responsibility for spiritual values. The spiritual values of life can be realized in the human form of material existence, and the human being must adopt family planning with reference to the context of spiritual values, and not otherwise. The degraded form of family restriction by use of contraceptives, etc., is the grossest type of material contamination. Materialists who use these devices want to fully utilize the pleasure potency of the coating on the genitals by artificial means, without knowing the spiritual importance. And without knowledge of spiritual values, the less intelligent man tries to utilize only the material sense pleasure of the genitals.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

In any case, He is never a formless void. Ignorance is the back of the Lord, and therefore the ignorance of the less intelligent class of men is also not separate from His bodily conception. Since His body is the complete whole of everything that be, one cannot assert that He is impersonal only. On the contrary, the perfect description of the Lord holds that He is both impersonal and personal simultaneously. The Personality of Godhead is the original feature of the Lord, and His impersonal emanation is but the reflection of His transcendental body. Those who are fortunate enough to have a view of the Lord from the front can realize His personal feature, whereas those who are frustrated and are thus kept on the ignorance side of the Lord, or, in other words, those who have the view of the Lord from the back, realize Him in His impersonal feature.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

A Brahm&#257; lives for one hundred such years and then dies. A Brahm&#257;, who is generally a great devotee of the Lord, attains liberation after such a downfall. The universe (called the <span class="Italic">brahm&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a,</span> or the round football-like domain controlled by a Brahm&#257;) is thus annihilated, and thus the inhabitants of a particular planet, or of the whole universe, are also annihilated. <span class="Italic">Avyakta,</span> mentioned here in this verse, means the night of Brahm&#257;, when partial annihilation takes place and the living entities of that particular <span class="Italic">brahm&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a,</span> up to the planets of Brahmaloka, along with the big oceans, etc., all repose in the belly of the <span class="Italic">vir&#257;&#7789;-puru&#7779;a.</span> At the end of a Brahm&#257;'s night, the creation again takes place, and the living entities, reserved within the belly of the Lord, are let loose to play their respective parts as if being awakened from a deep slumber. Since the living entities are never destroyed, the annihilation of the material world does not annihilate the existence of the living entities, but until liberation is attained one has to accept one material body after another, again and again. The human life is meant for making a solution to this repeated change of bodies and thereby attaining a place in the spiritual sky, where everything is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge. In other words, the subtle forms of the living entities take place in the heart of the Supreme Being, and such forms take tangible shape at the time of creation.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The manifested varieties of the universe are therefore not different from the Lord, just as golden ornaments of different shapes and forms are nondifferent from the original stock reserve of gold. In other words, the Lord is the Supreme Person who controls everything within the creation, and still He remains the supreme separate identity, distinct from all manifested material creation. In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexa3fb.html?g=3021">9.4</a>-5) He is therefore said to be Yoge&#347;vara. Everything rests on the potency of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and still the Lord is different from and transcendental to all such identities. In the Vedic <span class="Italic">Puru&#7779;a-s&#363;kta</span> of the <span class="Italic">&#7770;g mantra,</span> this is also confirmed. This philosophical truth of simultaneous oneness and difference was propounded by Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, and it is known as <span class="Italic">acintya-bhed&#257;bheda-tattva.</span> Brahm&#257;, N&#257;rada and all others are simultaneously one with the Lord and different from the Supreme Lord. We are all one with Him, just as the gold ornaments are one in quality with the stock gold, but the individual gold ornament is never equal in quantity with the stock gold. The stock gold is never exhausted even if there are innumerable ornaments emanating from the stock because the stock is <span class="Italic">p&#363;r&#7751;am,</span> complete; even if <span class="Italic">p&#363;r&#7751;am</span> is deducted from the <span class="Italic">p&#363;r&#7751;am,</span> still the supreme <span class="Italic">p&#363;r&#7751;am</span> remains the same <span class="Italic">p&#363;r&#7751;am.</span> This fact is inconceivable to our present imperfect senses.

The sunshine may expand all over the universe, but the source of the sunshine, namely the sun planet or the deity known as S&#363;rya-n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, is the basis of such radiation. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the basis of the impersonal <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> radiation, or the impersonal feature of the Lord. This is confirmed in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index3746.html?g=4826">14.27</a>). So the universal form of the Lord is the secondary imagination of the impersonal form of the Lord, but the primary form of the Lord is &#346;y&#257;masundara, with two hands, playing on His eternal flute. Seventy-five percent of the expansive radiation of the Lord is manifested in the spiritual sky (<span class="Italic">trip&#257;d-vibh&#363;ti</span>), and twenty-five percent of His personal radiation comprehends the entire expansion of the material universes.

Thus the seventy-five percent expansion of His radiation is called His internal energy, whereas the twenty-five percent expansion is called the external energy of the Lord. The living entities, who are residents of the spiritual as well as the material expansions, are His marginal energy (<span class="Italic">ta&#7789;astha-&#347;akti</span>), and they are at liberty to live in either of the energies, external or internal. Those who live within the spiritual expansion of the Lord are called liberated souls, whereas the residents of the external expansion are called the conditioned souls. We can just make an estimate of the number of the residents of the internal expansions in comparison with the number of residents in the external energy and may easily conclude that the liberated souls are far more numerous than the conditioned souls.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

It is said there that those planets in the spiritual sky, which comprises the seventy-five percent expansion of the internal potency of the Lord, are far, far greater than those planets in the total universes composed of the external potency of the Lord. In the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta,</span> the total universes in the external potency of the Lord are compared to a bucketful of mustard seeds. One mustard seed is calculated to be a universe itself. In one of the universes, in which we are now living, the number of planets cannot be counted by human energy, and so how can we think of the sum total in all the universes, which are compared to a bucketful of mustard seeds? And the planets in the spiritual sky are at least three times the number of those in the material sky. Such planets, being spiritual, are in fact transcendental to the material modes; therefore they are constituted in the mode of unalloyed goodness only. The conception of spiritual bliss (<span class="Italic">brahm&#257;nanda</span>) is fully present in those planets. Each of them is eternal, indestructible and free from all kinds of inebrieties experienced in the material world. Each of them is self-illuminating and more powerfully dazzling than (if we can imagine) the total sunshine of millions of mundane suns. The inhabitants of those planets are liberated from birth, death, old age and diseases and have full knowledge of everything; they are all godly and free from all sorts of material hankerings. They have nothing to do there except to render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, who is the predominating Deity of such Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets. Those liberated souls are engaged incessantly in singing songs mentioned in the <span class="Italic">S&#257;ma Veda</span> (<span class="Italic">vedai&#7717; s&#257;&#7749;ga-pada-kramopani&#7779;adair g&#257;yanti ya&#7745; s&#257;mag&#257;&#7717;</span>). All of them are personifications of the five <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads.</span> <span class="Italic">Trip&#257;d-vibh&#363;ti,</span> or the seventy-five percent known as the internal potency of the Lord, is to be understood as the kingdom of God far beyond the material sky; and when we speak of <span class="Italic">p&#257;da-vibh&#363;ti,</span> or the twenty-five percent comprising His external energy, we should understand that this refers to the sphere of the material world. It is also said in the <span class="Italic">Padma Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> that the kingdom of <span class="Italic">trip&#257;d-vibh&#363;ti</span> is transcendental, whereas the <span class="Italic">p&#257;da-vibh&#363;ti</span> is mundane; <span class="Italic">trip&#257;d-vibh&#363;ti</span> is eternal, whereas the <span class="Italic">p&#257;da-vibh&#363;ti</span> is transient. The Lord and His eternal servitors in the transcendental kingdom all have eternal forms which are auspicious, infallible, spiritual and eternally youthful. In other words, there is no birth, death, old age and disease. That eternal land is full of transcendental enjoyment and full of beauty and bliss. This very fact is also corroborated in this verse of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> and the transcendental nature is described as <span class="Italic">am&#7771;ta.</span> As described in the <span class="Italic">Vedas, ut&#257;m&#7771;tatvasye&#347;&#257;na&#7717;:</span> the Supreme Lord is the Lord of immortality, or in other words, the Lord is immortal, and because He is the Lord of immortality He can award immortality to His devotees. In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexa520.html?g=2877">8.16</a>) the Lord also assures that whoever may go to His abode of immortality shall never return to this mortal land of threefold miseries. The Lord is not like the mundane lord. The mundane master or lord never enjoys equally with his subordinates, nor is a mundane lord immortal, nor can he award immortality to his subordinate. The Supreme Lord, who is the leader of all living entities, can award all the qualities of His personality unto His devotees, including immortality and spiritual bliss. In the material world there is always anxiety or fearfulness in the hearts of all living entities, but the Lord, being Himself the supreme fearless, also awards the same quality of fearlessness to His pure devotees. Mundane existence is itself a kind of fear because in all mundane bodies the effects of birth, death, old age and disease always keep a living being compact in fear. In the mundane world, there is always the influence of time, which changes things from one stage to another, and the living entity, originally being <span class="Italic">avik&#257;ra,</span> or unchangeable, suffers a great deal on account of changes due to the influence of time. The changing effects of eternal time are conspicuously absent in the immortal kingdom of God, which should therefore be understood to have no influence of time and therefore no fear whatsoever. In the material world, so-called happiness is the result of one's own work. One can become a rich man by dint of one's own hard labor, and there are always fear and doubts as to the duration of such acquired happiness. But in the kingdom of God, no one has to endeavor to attain a standard of happiness. Happiness is the nature of the spirit, as stated in the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tras:</span> <span class="Italic">&#257;nandamayo 'bhy&#257;s&#257;t</span>-the spirit is by nature full of happiness. Happiness in spiritual nature always increases in volume with a new phase of appreciation; there is no question of decreasing the bliss. Such unalloyed spiritual bliss is nowhere to be found within the orbit of the material universe, including the Janaloka planets, or, for that matter, the Maharloka or Satyaloka planets, because even Lord Brahm&#257; is subject to the laws of fruitive actions and the law of birth and death. It is therefore stated here: <span class="Italic">duratyaya&#7717;,</span> or, in other words, spiritual happiness in the eternal kingdom of God cannot be imagined even by the great <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;s</span> or <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s</span> who are eligible to be promoted to the planets beyond the region of heaven. Or, the greatness of the Supreme Lord is so great that it cannot be imagined even by the great <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;s</span> or <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s,</span> but such happiness is factually attained by the unalloyed devotees of the Lord, by His divine grace.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Human civilization in which there is no control of sex life is a fourth-class civilization because in such an atmosphere there is no liberation of the soul encaged in the material body. Birth, death, old age and disease are related to the material body, and they have nothing to do with the spirit soul. But as long as the bodily attachment for sensual enjoyment is encouraged, the individual spirit soul is forced to continue the repetition of birth and death on account of the material body, which is compared to garments subjected to the law of deterioration.</div><A NAME="25332"></A><div class="Purport">In order to award the highest benefit of human life, the <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</span> system trains the follower to adopt the vow of celibacy beginning from the order of <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;.</span> The <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> life is for students who are educated to follow strictly the vow of celibacy. Youngsters who have had no taste of sex life can easily follow the vow of celibacy, and once fixed in the principle of such a life, one can very easily continue to the highest perfectional stage, attaining the kingdom of the three-fourths energy of the Lord. It is already explained that in the cosmos of three-fourths energy of the Lord there is neither death nor fear, and one is full of the blissful life of happiness and knowledge. A householder attached to family life can easily give up such a life of sex indulgence if he has been trained in the principles of the life of a <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;.</span> A householder is recommended to quit home at the end of fifty years (<span class="Italic">pa&ntilde;ca&#347;ordhva&#7745; vana&#7745; vrajet</span>) and live a life in the forest; then, being fully detached from family affection, he may accept the order of renunciation as a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> fully engaged in the service of the Lord. Any form of religious principles in which the followers are trained to pursue the vow of celibacy is good for the human being because only those who are trained in that way can end the miserable life of material existence. The principles of <span class="Italic">nirv&#257;&#7751;a,</span> as recommended by Lord Buddha, are also meant for ending the miserable life of material existence. And this process, in the highest degree, is recommended here in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> with clear perception of ideal perfection, although basically there is no difference between the process of Buddhists, &#346;a&#7749;karites and Vai&#7779;&#7751;avites. For promotion to the highest status of perfection, namely freedom from birth and death, anxiety and fearfulness, not one of these processes allows the follower to break the vow of celibacy.</div><A NAME="25333"></A><div class="Purport">The householders and persons who have deliberately broken the vow of celibacy cannot enter into the kingdom of deathlessness. The pious householders or the fallen <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> or the fallen transcendentalists can be promoted to the higher planets within the material world (one fourth of the energy of the Lord), but they will fail to enter into the kingdom of deathlessness. <span class="Italic">Ab&#7771;had-vratas</span> are those who have broken the vow of celibacy. The <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprasthas,</span> or those retired from family life, and the <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s,</span> or the renounced persons, cannot break the vow of celibacy if they want success in the process. The <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;s, v&#257;naprasthas</span> and <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s</span> do not intend to take rebirth (<span class="Italic">apraja</span>), nor are they meant for secretly indulging in sex life. Such a falldown by the spiritualist may be compensated by another chance for human life in good families of learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> or of rich merchants for another term of elevation, but the best thing is to attain the highest perfection of deathlessness as soon as the human form of life is attained; otherwise the whole policy of human life will prove to be a total failure. Lord Caitanya was very strict in advising His followers in this matter of celibacy. One of His personal attendants, Cho&#7789;a Harid&#257;sa, was severely punished by Lord Caitanya because of his failure to observe the vow of celibacy. For a transcendentalist, therefore, who at all wants to be promoted to the kingdom beyond material miseries, it is worse than suicide to deliberately indulge in sex life, especially in the renounced order of life. Sex life in the renounced order of life is the most perverted form of religious life, and such a misguided person can only be saved if, by chance, he meets a pure devotee.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexc1e9.html?g=4331">13.3</a>) the matter is explained as follows:</div><A NAME="25348"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">k&#7779;etraj&ntilde;a&#7745; c&#257;pi m&#257;&#7745; viddhi<br>sarva-k&#7779;etre&#7779;u bh&#257;rata<br>k&#7779;etra-k&#7779;etraj&ntilde;ayor j&ntilde;&#257;na&#7745;<br>yat taj j&ntilde;&#257;na&#7745; mata&#7745; mama</div></div><A NAME="25349"></A><div class="After-Verse"><span class="Italic">k&#7779;etra</span> means the place, and one who knows the place is called the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;etraj&ntilde;a.</span> The individual self knows about his limited field of activities, but the Supreme Self, the Lord, knows about the unlimited field of activities. The individual soul knows about his own thinking, feeling and willing activities, but the Supersoul, or the Param&#257;tm&#257;, the supreme controller, being present everywhere, knows everyone's thinking, feeling and willing activities, and as such the individual living entity is the minute master of his personal affairs whereas the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the master of everyone's affairs, past, present and future (<span class="Italic">ved&#257;ha&#7745; samat&#299;t&#257;ni,</span> etc. [Bg. <a href="index5606.html?g=2694">7.26</a>]<I>.</I>). Only the ignorant person does not know this difference between the Lord and the living entities. The living entities, as distinguished from incognizant matter, may be qualitatively equal to the Lord in cognizance, but the living entity can never be equal to the Lord in full knowledge of past, present and future.</div><A NAME="25350"></A><div class="Purport">And because the living entity is partially cognizant, he is therefore sometimes forgetful of his own identity. This forgetfulness is specifically manifested in the field of the <span class="Italic">ekap&#257;d-vibh&#363;ti</span> of the Lord, or in the material world, but in the <span class="Italic">trip&#257;d-vibh&#363;ti</span> field of actions, or in the spiritual world, there is no forgetfulness by the living entities, who are free from all kinds of contaminations resulting from the forgetful state of existence. The material body is the symbol of the gross and subtle form of forgetfulness; therefore the whole atmosphere of the material world is called <span class="Italic">avidy&#257;,</span> or nescience, whereas the whole atmosphere of the spiritual world is called <span class="Italic">vidy&#257;,</span> or full of knowledge. There are different stages of <span class="Italic">avidy&#257;,</span> and they are called <span class="Italic">dharma, artha</span> and <span class="Italic">mok&#7779;a.</span> The idea of <span class="Italic">mok&#7779;a,</span> or liberation, held by the monist in the matter of oneness of the living entity and the Lord by ultimate merging in one, is also the last stage of materialism or forgetfulness. Knowledge of the qualitative oneness of the self and Superself is partial knowledge and ignorance also because there is no knowledge of quantitative difference, as explained above. The individual self can never be equal to the Lord in cognizance; otherwise he could not be placed in the state of forgetfulness. So, because there is a stage of forgetfulness of the individual selves, or the living entities, there is always a gulf of difference between the Lord and the living entity, as between the part and the whole. The part is never equal to the whole. So the conception of one hundred percent equality of the living being with the Lord is also nescience.</div><A NAME="25351"></A><div class="Purport">In the field of nescience, activities are directed toward lording it over the creation. In the material world, therefore, everyone is engaged in acquiring material opulence to lord it over the material world. Therefore there is always clash and frustration, which are the symptoms of nescience. But in the field of knowledge, there is devotional service to the Lord (<span class="Italic">bhakti</span>). Therefore there is no chance of being contaminated by the influence of nescience or forgetfulness (<span class="Italic">avidy&#257;</span>) in the liberated stage of devotional activities. The Lord is thus the proprietor of the fields both of nescience and of cognition, and it remains the choice of the living entity to exist in either of the above regions.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The original form of the Lord is the transcendental form of Puru&#7779;ottama, or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself. It is very nicely explained herein that He expands Himself just like the sun. The sun expands itself by its terrible heat and rays, yet the sun is always aloof from such rays and heat. The impersonalist takes into consideration the rays of the Lord without any information of the tangible, transcendental, eternal form of the Lord, known as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.

The general process is that a living creature is born out of the sex combination of the male father and the female mother. But Brahm&#257;, the firstborn living being, is born out of the abdominal lotus flower of the Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u plenary expansion of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The abdominal lotus flower is part of the Lord's bodily limbs, and Brahm&#257; is born out of the lotus flower. Therefore Lord Brahm&#257; is also a part of the Lord's body. Brahm&#257;, after his appearance in the gigantic hollow of the universe, saw darkness and nothing else. He felt perplexity, and from his heart he was inspired by the Lord to undergo austerity, thereby acquiring the ingredients for sacrificial performances. But there was nothing besides the two of them, namely the Personality of Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and Brahm&#257; himself, born of the bodily part of the Lord. For sacrificial performances many ingredients were in need, especially animals. The animal sacrifice is never meant for killing the animal, but for achieving the successful result of the sacrifice. The animal offered in the sacrificial fire is, so to speak, destroyed, but the next moment it is given a new life by dint of the Vedic hymns chanted by the expert priest. When such an expert priest is not available, the animal sacrifice in the fire of the sacrificial altar is forbidden. Thus Brahm&#257; created even the sacrificial ingredients out of the bodily limbs of the Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, which means that the cosmic order was created by Brahm&#257; himself. Also, nothing is created out of nothing, but everything is created from the person of the Lord. The Lord says in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index58fa.html?g=3360">10.8</a>), <span class="Italic">aha&#7745; sarvasya prabhavo matta&#7717; sarva&#7745; pravartate.</span> "Everything is made from My bodily limbs, and I am therefore the original source of all creations."</div><A NAME="25382"></A><div class="Purport">The impersonalists argue that there is no use in worshiping the Lord when everything is nothing but the Lord Himself. The personalist, however, worships the Lord out of a great sense of gratitude, utilizing the ingredients born out of the bodily limbs of the Lord. The fruits and flowers are available from the body of the earth, and yet mother earth is worshiped by the sensible devotee with ingredients born from the earth. Similarly, mother Ganges is worshiped by the water of the Ganges, and yet the worshiper enjoys the result of such worship. Worship of the Lord is also performed by the ingredients born from the bodily limbs of the Lord, and yet the worshiper, who is himself a part of the Lord, achieves the result of devotional service to the Lord. While the impersonalist wrongly concludes that he is the Lord himself, the personalist, out of a great gratitude, worships the Lord in devotional service, knowing perfectly well that nothing is different from the Lord. The devotee therefore endeavors to apply everything in the service of the Lord because he knows that everything is the property of the Lord and that no one can claim anything as one's own. This perfect conception of oneness helps the worshiper in being engaged in His loving service, whereas the impersonalist, being falsely puffed up, remains a nondevotee forever, without being recognized by the Lord.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Nor are they recommended in this fallen age. Any such sacrifice undertaken in this age as a matter of show may simply be a cheating process by the clever priestly order. But such a show of sacrifices cannot be effective at any stage. Fruitive action is being carried on by the help of material science and to a little extent by gross material help, but the materialists await a still more subtle advancement in the process of vibrating sounds on which the Vedic hymns are established. Gross material science cannot divert the real purpose of human life. They can only increase the artificial needs of life without any solution to the problems of life; therefore the way of materialistic life leads to the wrong type of human civilization. Since the ultimate aim of life is spiritual realization, the direct way of invoking the holy name of the Lord, as mentioned above, is precisely recommended by Lord Caitanya, and people of the modern age can easily take advantage of this simple process, which is tenable for the condition of the complicated social structure.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Material actions and reactions, as the material scientist can superficially observe, are not basically ultimate truth in regard to creation, maintenance and destruction. The material energy is a potency of the Lord which is displayed in time, accepting the three qualities of goodness, passion and ignorance in the forms of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, Brahm&#257; and &#346;iva. The material energy thus works under the supreme spell of His Lordship, although He is always transcendental to all such material activities. A rich man constructs a big house by spending his energy in the shape of resources, and similarly he destroys a big house by his resources, but the maintenance is always under his personal care. The Lord is the richest of the rich because He is always fully complete in six opulences. Therefore He is not required to do anything personally, but everything in the material world is carried out by His wishes and direction; therefore, the entire material manifestation is situated in N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The impersonal conception of the supreme truth is due to lack of knowledge only, and this fact is clearly explained by Brahm&#257;j&#299;, who is supposed to be the creator of the universal affairs. Brahm&#257;j&#299; is the highest authority in Vedic wisdom, and his assertion in this connection is therefore the supreme information.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The one is Lord V&#257;sudeva, and only by His different energies and expansions are different manifestations, both in the material and in the spiritual worlds, maintained. In the material world also, Lord V&#257;sudeva is everything, as stated in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index4112.html?g=2631">7.19</a>). <span class="Italic">V&#257;sudeva&#7717; sarvam iti:</span> everything is V&#257;sudeva only. In the Vedic hymns also the same V&#257;sudeva is held to be supreme. It is said in the <span class="Italic">Vedas, v&#257;sudev&#257;t paro brahman na c&#257;nyo 'rtho 'sti tattvata&#7717;:</span> in fact there is no greater truth than V&#257;sudeva. And Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a affirms the same truth in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexef42.html?g=2523">7.7</a>). <span class="Italic">Matta&#7717; paratara&#7745; n&#257;nyat:</span> "There is nothing above Me [Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a]." So the conception of oneness, as overly stressed by the impersonalist, is also accepted by the personalist devotee of the Lord. The difference is that the impersonalist denies personality in the ultimate issue, whereas the devotee gives more importance to the Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> explains this truth in the verse under discussion: Lord V&#257;sudeva is one without a second, but because He is all-powerful, He can expand Himself as well as display His omnipotencies. The Lord is described here as omnipotent by three energies (<span class="Italic">tri-&#347;akti-dh&#7771;k</span>). So primarily His three energies are internal, marginal and external. This external energy is also displayed in the three modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. Similarly, the internal potency is also displayed in three spiritual modes-<span class="Italic">sa&#7745;vit, sandhin&#299;</span> and <span class="Italic">hl&#257;din&#299;.</span> The marginal potency, or the living entities, is also spiritual (<span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti&#7745; viddhi me par&#257;m</span>), but the living entities are never equal to the Lord. The Lord is <span class="Italic">nirasta-s&#257;mya-ati&#347;aya;</span> in other words, no one is greater than or equal to the Supreme Lord. So the living entities, including even such great personalities as Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord &#346;iva, are all subordinate to the Lord. In the material world also, in His eternal form of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, He maintains and controls all the affairs of the demigods, including Brahm&#257; and &#346;iva.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The followers of Vedic wisdom accept the statements of Brahm&#257;j&#299; as gospel truth, and transcendental knowledge is thus being distributed all over the world by the process of disciplic succession from time immemorial, since the beginning of the creation. Lord Brahm&#257; is the perfect liberated living being within the material world, and any sincere student of transcendental knowledge must accept the words and statements of Brahm&#257;j&#299; as infallible. The Vedic knowledge is infallible because it comes down directly from the Supreme Lord unto the heart of Brahm&#257;, and since he is the most perfect living being, Brahm&#257;j&#299; is always correct to the letter. And this is because Lord Brahm&#257; is a great devotee of the Lord who has earnestly accepted the lotus feet of the Lord as the supreme truth. In the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;,</span> which is compiled by Brahm&#257;j&#299;, he repeats the aphorism <span class="Italic">govindam &#257;di-puru&#7779;a&#7745; tam aha&#7745; bhaj&#257;mi: **</span> "I am a worshiper of the original Personality of Godhead, Govinda, the primeval Lord." So whatever he says, whatever he thinks, and whatever he does normally in his mood are to be accepted as truth because of his direct and very intimate connection with Govinda, the primeval Lord. &#346;r&#299; Govinda, who pleasingly accepts the loving transcendental service of His devotees, gives all protection to the words and actions of His devotees. The Lord declares in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexa9e1.html?g=3264">9.31</a>), <span class="Italic">kaunteya pratij&#257;n&#299;hi:</span> "O son of Kunt&#299;, please declare it." The Lord asks Arjuna to declare, and why? Because sometimes the declaration of Govinda Himself may seem contradictory to mundane creatures, but the mundaner will never find any contradiction in the words of the Lord's devotees. The devotees are especially protected by the Lord so that they may remain infallible. Therefore the process of devotional service always begins in the service of the devotee who appears in disciplic succession. The devotees are always liberated, but that does not mean that they are impersonal. The Lord is a person eternally, and the devotee of the Lord is also a person eternally. Because the devotee has his sense organs even at the liberated stage, he is therefore a person always. And because the devotee's service is accepted by the Lord in full reciprocation, the Lord is also a person in His complete spiritual embodiment. The devotee's senses, being engaged in the service of the Lord, never go astray under the attraction of false material enjoyment. The plans of the devotee never go in vain, and all this is due to the faithful attachment of the devotee for the service of the Lord. This is the standard of perfection and liberation. Anyone, beginning from Brahm&#257;j&#299; down to the human being, is at once put on the path of liberation simply by his attachment in great earnestness for the Supreme Lord, &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the primeval Lord. The Lord affirms this in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexee26.html?g=4817">14.26</a>):</div><A NAME="25544"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">m&#257;&#7745; ca yo 'vyabhic&#257;re&#7751;a<br>bhakti-yogena sevate<br>sa gu&#7751;&#257;n samat&#299;tyait&#257;n<br>brahma-bh&#363;y&#257;ya kalpate</div></div><A NAME="25545"></A><div class="After-Verse">Anyone, therefore, who is earnestly serious in heart and soul about being in intimate touch with the Personality of Godhead in the relationship of transcendental loving service will always be infallible in words and action. The reason is that the Supreme Lord is Absolute Truth, and anything earnestly dovetailed with the Absolute Truth attains the same transcendental quality. On the other hand, any amount of mental speculation on the strength of material science and knowledge without any bona fide touch with the Absolute Truth is sure to be a mundane untruth and failure, simply due to not being in touch with the Absolute Truth. Such godless, unfaithful words and actions, however materially enriched, are never to be trusted. That is the purport of this important verse. A grain of devotion is more valuable than tons of faithlessness.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Therefore, the Lord can be known only by the sincere mood of eagerness for service, and not by any amount of material qualification as scientist or speculative philosopher or by attainment of mystic powers. This fact is clearly corroborated in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexc2a1.html?g=5889">18.54</a>-55):</div><A NAME="25560"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">brahma-bh&#363;ta&#7717; prasann&#257;tm&#257;<br>na &#347;ocati na k&#257;&#7749;k&#7779;ati<br>sama&#7717; sarve&#7779;u bh&#363;te&#7779;u<br>mad-bhakti&#7745; labhate par&#257;m</div></div><A NAME="25561"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">bhakty&#257; m&#257;m abhij&#257;n&#257;ti<br>y&#257;v&#257;n ya&#347; c&#257;smi tattvata&#7717;<br>tato m&#257;&#7745; tattvato j&ntilde;&#257;tv&#257;<br>vi&#347;ate tad-anantaram</div></div><A NAME="25562"></A><div class="After-Verse">Only self-realization, by attainment of the above high qualifications of Vedic wisdom, austerity, etc., can help one on the path of devotional service. But failing in devotional service, one remains still imperfect because even in that position of self-realization one cannot factually know the Supreme Lord. By self-realization, one is qualified to become a devotee, and the devotee, by service mood (<span class="Italic">bhakty&#257;</span>) only, can gradually know the Personality of Godhead. One should not, however, misunderstand the import of <span class="Italic">vi&#347;ate</span> ("enters into") as referring to merging into the existence of the Supreme. Even in material existence, one is merged in the existence of the Lord. No materialist can disentangle self from matter, for the self is merged in the external energy of the Lord. As no layman can separate butter from milk, no one can extricate the merged self from matter by acquiring some material qualification. This <span class="Italic">vi&#347;ate</span> by devotion (<span class="Italic">bhakty&#257;</span>) means to be able to participate in the association of the Lord in person. <span class="Italic">Bhakti,</span> or devotional service to the Lord, means to become free from material entanglement and then to enter into the kingdom of God, becoming one like Him. Losing one's individuality is not the aim of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> or of the devotees of the Lord. There are five types of liberation, one of which is called <span class="Italic">s&#257;yujya-mukti,</span> or being merged into the existence or body of the Lord. The other forms of liberation maintain the individuality of the particle soul and involve being always engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. The word <span class="Italic">vi&#347;ate,</span> used in the verses of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> is thus meant for the devotees who are not at all anxious for any kind of liberation. The devotees are satisfied simply in being engaged in the service of the Lord, regardless of the situation.</div><A NAME="25563"></A><div class="Purport">Lord Brahm&#257; is the first living being, who directly learned the Vedic wisdom from the Lord (<span class="Italic">tene brahma h&#7771;d&#257; ya &#257;di-kavaye</I> [</I>SB</I> </span></I><a href="index4dab.html?g=6120">1.1.1</a></I>]</I>). Therefore, who can be a more learned Ved&#257;ntist than Lord Brahm&#257;? He admits that in spite of his perfect knowledge in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> he was unable to know the glories of the Lord. Since no one can be more than Lord Brahm&#257;, how can a so-called Ved&#257;ntist be perfectly cognizant of the Absolute Truth? <JD:"Destination-426">The so-called Ved&#257;ntist, therefore, cannot enter into the existence of the Lord without being trained in the matter of <span class="Italic">bhakti-ved&#257;nta,</span> or <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta</span> plus <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta</span> means self-realization, and <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> means realization of the Personality of Godhead, to some extent. No one can know the Personality of Godhead in full, but at least to a certain extent one can know the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, by self-surrender and a devotional attitude, and by nothing else. In the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> also, it is said, <span class="Italic">vede&#7779;u durlabham,</span> or simply by study of Ved&#257;nta one can hardly find out the existence of the Personality of Godhead, but the Lord is <span class="Italic">adurlabham &#257;tma-bhaktau,</span> very easily available to His devotee. &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva, therefore, was not satisfied simply with compiling the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tras,</span> but over and above this, by the advice of his spiritual master, N&#257;rada, he compiled the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> in order to understand the real import of <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta.</span> <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> therefore, is the absolute medium by which to understand the Absolute Truth.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Lord Brahm&#257; is known as the <span class="Italic">pit&#257;maha,</span> or the father's father. A young man consults his experienced father about discharging his duties. So the father is naturally a good advisor. But Lord Brahm&#257; is the father of all fathers. He is the father of the father of Manu, who is the father of mankind all over the universal planets. Therefore the men of this insignificant planet should kindly accept the instruction of Brahm&#257;j&#299; and would do well to surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord rather than try to estimate the length and breadth of the Lord's potencies. His potencies are immeasurable, as confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> <span class="Italic">Par&#257;sya &#347;aktir vividhaiva &#347;r&#363;yate sv&#257;bh&#257;vik&#299; j&ntilde;&#257;na-bala-kriy&#257; ca</span> (<span class="Italic">&#346;vet&#257;&#347;vatara Upani&#7779;ad</span> 6.8<span class="Italic"> </I>[</I>Cc.

He is the greatest of all, and all others, even the greatest of all living beings, namely Brahm&#257;j&#299;, admits that the best thing for us is to surrender unto Him. Therefore only those persons with a very poor fund of knowledge claim that they themselves are lords of all that they survey. And what can they survey? They cannot survey even the length and breadth of a small sky in one small universe. The so-called material scientist says that he would need to live forty thousand years to reach the highest planet of the universe, being carried by a sputnik. This is also utopian because no one can be expected to live forty thousand years. Besides, when the space pilot returned from his travel, none of his friends would be present to receive him back as the greatest astronaut, as has become fashionable for modern bewildered scientific men. One scientific man, who had no belief in God, was very much enthusiastic in making plans for his material existence and therefore opened a hospital to save the living. But after opening the hospital, he himself died within six months. So one should not spoil his human life, species of life, simply for the concocted material happiness of life through increasing artificial needs in the name of advancement of economic development and scientific knowledge. Rather, one should simply surrender unto the feet of the Lord to make a solution to all miseries of life. That is the instruction of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a directly in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> and that is the instruction of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> by Brahm&#257;j&#299;, the supreme father of all living beings.</div><A NAME="25578"></A><div class="Purport">Anyone denying this surrendering process as recommended both in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span>-and, for that matter, in all authorized scriptures-will be forced to surrender unto the laws of material nature. The living entity, by his constitutional position, is not independent. He must surrender, either unto the Lord or unto material nature. Material nature is also not independent of the Lord, since the Lord Himself has claimed material nature as <span class="Italic">mama m&#257;y&#257;,</span> or "My energy" (Bg. <a href="indexd990.html?g=2586">7.14</a>), and as <span class="Italic">me bhinn&#257; prak&#7771;tir a&#7779;&#7789;adh&#257;,</span> or "My separated energy in eight divisions" (Bg. <a href="index7379.html?g=2496">7.4</a>). Therefore material nature is also controlled by the Lord, as He has claimed in <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index652d.html?g=3075">9.10</a>). <span class="Italic">May&#257;dhyak&#7779;e&#7751;a prak&#7771;ti&#7717; s&#363;yate sacar&#257;caram:</span> "Under My direction only is material nature working, and thus are all things moving." And the living entities, being superior energy to matter, have choice and discrimination either to surrender unto the Lord or to surrender unto material nature. By surrendering unto the Lord, one is happy and liberated, but by surrendering unto material nature the living entity suffers. So the end of all suffering means surrendering unto the Lord because the surrendering process itself is <span class="Italic">bhava-cchidam</span> (liberation from all material miseries), <span class="Italic">svasty-ayanam</span> (perception of all happiness), and <span class="Italic">suma&#7749;galam</span> (the source of everything auspicious).</div><A NAME="25579"></A><div class="Purport">Therefore liberty, happiness and all good fortune can be attained only by surrendering unto the Lord because He is full liberty, full happiness and full auspiciousness. Such liberation and happiness are also unlimited, and they have been compared to the sky, although such liberation and happiness are infinitely greater than the sky. In our present position we can simply understand the magnitude of greatness when it is compared to the sky. We fail to measure the sky, but the happiness and liberty obtained in association with the Lord are far greater than the sky. That spiritual happiness is so great that it cannot be measured, even by the Lord Himself, not to speak of others.</div><A NAME="25580"></A><div class="Purport">It is said in the scriptures, <span class="Italic">brahma-saukhya&#7745; tv anantam:</span> spiritual happiness is unlimited. Here it is said that even the Lord cannot measure such happiness. This does not mean that the Lord cannot measure it and is therefore imperfect in that sense. The actual position is that the Lord can measure it, but the happiness in the Lord is also identical with the Lord on account of absolute knowledge. So the happiness derived from the Lord may be measured by the Lord, but the happiness increases again, and the Lord measures it again, and then again the happiness increases more and more, and the Lord measures it more and more, and as such there is eternally a competition between increment and measurement, so much so that the competition is never stopped, but goes on unlimitedly <span class="Italic">ad infinitum.</span> Spiritual happiness is <span class="Italic">&#257;nand&#257;mbudhi-vardhanam,</span> or the ocean of happiness which increases.

But when the senses are purified by the process of hearing, chanting, remembering, and worshiping the lotus feet of the holy Deity, etc., the Lord reveals Himself proportionately to the advancement of the quality of devotional service (<span class="Italic">ye yath&#257; m&#257;&#7745; prapadyante </I>[</I>Bg. </span><a href="index477f.html?g=1523">4.11</a>]). One should not expect the Lord to be an order-supplying agent who must be present before us as soon as we desire to see Him. We must be ready to undergo the prescribed devotional duties, following the path shown by the predecessors in the disciplic succession from Brahm&#257;, N&#257;rada and similar authorities. As the senses are progressively purified by bona fide devotional service, the Lord reveals His identity according to the spiritual advancement of the devotee. But one who is not in the line of devotional service can hardly perceive Him simply by calculations and philosophical speculations. Such a hard worker can present a jugglery of words before an audience, but can never know the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His personal feature. The Lord has clearly stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> that one can know Him only by devotional service. No one can know the Lord by any puffed-up material process of challenge, but the humble devotee can please the Lord by his earnest devotional activities.

The impersonalist gives stress to the impersonal form or feature of the Lord and does not believe in the original personality of the Lord, but the Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas accept the original form of the Lord, of whom the impersonal form is merely one of the features. The impersonal and personal conceptions of the Lord are existing simultaneously, and this fact is clearly described both in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> and also in other Vedic scriptures. Inconceivable to human intelligence, the idea must simply be accepted on the authority of the scriptures, and it can only be practically realized by the progress of devotional service unto the Lord, and never by mental speculation or inductive logic. The impersonalists depend more or less on inductive logic, and therefore they always remain in darkness about the original Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Their conception of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is not clear, although everything is clearly mentioned in all the Vedic scriptures. A poor fund of knowledge cannot comprehend the existence of an original personal form of the Lord when He is expanded in everything.

O N&#257;rada, O great sage, the great thinkers can know Him when completely freed from all material hankerings and when sheltered under undisturbed conditions of the senses. Otherwise, by untenable arguments, all is distorted, and the Lord disappears from our sight.</div><A NAME="25651"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="25652"></A><div class="First">Here is an estimation of the Lord apart from His transcendental activities in the temporary, material creations. M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da philosophy tries to designate the Lord as contaminated by a material body when He accepts forms of incarnation. This sort of interpolation is completely denied herein by the explanation that the Lord's position is pure and unalloyed in all circumstances. According to M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da philosophy, the spirit soul, when covered by nescience, is designated as <span class="Italic">j&#299;va,</span> but when freed from such ignorance or nescience he merges in the impersonal existence of the Absolute Truth. But here it is said that the Lord is eternally the symbol of full and perfect knowledge. This is His speciality: perpetual freedom from all material contaminations. This distinguishes the Lord from the individual, common living entities who have the aptitude for being subordinated by nescience and thus becoming materially designated. In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> it is said that the Lord is <span class="Italic">vij&ntilde;&#257;nam &#257;nandam,</span> full of bliss and knowledge. The conditioned souls are never to be compared to Him because such individual souls have the tendency to become contaminated. Although after liberation the living entity can become one with the same quality of existence as the Lord, his very tendency to become contaminated, which the Lord never has, makes the individual living entity different from the Lord. In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">&#347;uddham ap&#257;pa-viddham:</span> the individual <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;</span> becomes polluted by sin, but the Lord is never contaminated by sins. The Lord is compared to the powerful sun. The sun is never contaminated by anything infectious because it is so powerful. On the contrary, infected things are sterilized by the rays of the sun. Similarly, the Lord is never contaminated by sins; on the contrary, the sinful living entities become sterilized by contact with the Lord. This means that the Lord is also all-pervading like the sun, and as such the word <span class="Italic">pratyak</span> is used in this verse. Nothing is excluded from the existence of the Lord's potential expansions. The Lord is within everything, and He is all-covering also, without being disturbed by the activities of the individual souls. He is therefore infinite, and the living entities are infinitesimal. In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> it is said that only the Lord alone exists, and all others' existences depend on Him. He is the generating reservoir for everyone's existential capacity; He is the Supreme Truth of all other categorical truths. He is the source of everyone's opulence, and therefore no one can equal Him in opulence. Being full of all opulences, namely wealth, fame, strength, beauty, knowledge and renunciation, certainly He is the Supreme Person. And because He is a person, He has many personal qualities, although He is transcendental to the material modes. We have already discussed the statement, <span class="Italic">ittha&#7745;-bh&#363;ta-gu&#7751;o hari&#7717;</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">SB</span> <a href="index093f.html?g=8124">1.7.10</a>). His transcendental qualities are so attractive that even the liberated souls (<span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;r&#257;mas</span>) are also attracted by them. Although possessed of all personal qualities, He is nevertheless omnipotent. Therefore, personally He has nothing to do, for everything is being carried out by His omnipotent energies. This is confirmed by the Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras:</span> <span class="Italic">par&#257;sya &#347;aktir vividhaiva &#347;r&#363;yate sv&#257;bh&#257;vik&#299; j&ntilde;&#257;na-bala-kriy&#257; ca </I>[</I>Cc. Madhya</I> <a href="index4653.html?g=113909">13.65</a>,</I> purport</I>]</I>.</span> This suggests His specific spiritual form, which can never be experienced by the material senses. He can be seen only when the senses are purified by devotional service (<span class="Italic">yam evai&#7779;a v&#7771;&#7751;ute tena -labhya&#7717; </span><span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Ka&#7789;ha Upani&#7779;ad</span></B> 1.2.23). As such, there are basic differences between the Lord and the living entities, in so many respects. No one can be compared to the Lord, as the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> declare (<span class="Italic">ekam ev&#257;dvit&#299;ya&#7745; brahma, dvait&#257;d vai bhaya&#7745; bhavati</span>). The Lord has no competitor, and He has nothing to fear from any other being, nor can anyone be equal to Him. Although He is the root of all other beings, there are basic differences between Him and other beings. Otherwise there would have been no necessity for the statement in the previous verse that no one can know Him one hundred percent as He is (<span class="Italic">na ya&#7745; vidanti tattvena</span>). That no one can fully understand Him is explained also in this verse, but the qualification for understanding to some degree is mentioned here. Only the <span class="Italic">pra&#347;&#257;ntas,</span> or the unalloyed devotees of the Lord, can know Him to a greater extent. The reason is that the devotees have no demands in their lives but to be obedient servants of the Lord, while all others, namely the empiric philosophers, the mystics and the fruitive workers, all basically have some demand, and as such they cannot be pacified. The fruitive worker wants reward for his work, the mystic wants some perfection of life, and the empiric philosopher wants to merge in the existence of the Lord. Somehow or other, as long as there is a demand for sense satisfaction, there is no chance for pacification; on the contrary, by unnecessary dry speculative arguments, the whole matter becomes distorted, and thus the Lord moves still further away from our understanding. The dry speculators, however, because of their following the principles of austerity and penance, can have knowledge of the impersonal features of the Lord to some extent, but there is no chance of their understanding His ultimate form as Govinda because only the <span class="Italic">amal&#257;tmanas,</span> or the completely sinless persons, can accept pure devotional service to the Lord, as confirmed in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index49d1.html?g=2712">7.28</a>):</div><A NAME="25653"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">ye&#7779;&#257;&#7745; tv anta-gata&#7745; p&#257;pa&#7745;<br>jan&#257;n&#257;&#7745; pu&#7751;ya-karma&#7751;&#257;m<br>te dvandva-moha-nirmukt&#257;<br>bhajante m&#257;&#7745; d&#7771;&#7693;ha-vrat&#257;&#7717;</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Such unwilling conditioned souls are not allowed to enter into the liberated life of spiritual existence because at heart they are not willing to serve. Instead, they want to enjoy themselves as imitation Gods.

It is called illusion because the living beings under the clutches of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> are not factually enjoyers, although they think that they are, being illusioned by <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> Such illusioned living entities are given a chance at intervals to rectify their perverted mentality of becoming false masters of the material nature, and they are imparted lessons from the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> about their eternal relationship with the Supreme Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (<span class="Italic">vedai&#347; ca sarvair aham eva vedya&#7717;</I> [</I>Bg</I>. </span></I><a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a>]). So the temporary creation of the material manifestation is an exhibition of the material energy of the Lord, and to manage the whole show the Supreme Lord incarnates Himself as the K&#257;ra&#7751;&#257;r&#7751;ava&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u just as a magistrate is deputed by the government to manage affairs temporarily. This K&#257;ra&#7751;odaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u causes the manifestation of material creation by looking over His material energy (<span class="Italic">sa aik&#7779;ata</span>). In the first volume of this book we have already discussed to some extent the explanation of the verse <span class="Italic">jag&#7771;he pauru&#7779;a&#7745; r&#363;pam.</span> The duration of the illusory play of material creation is called a <span class="Italic">kalpa,</span> and we have already discussed the creation's taking place in <span class="Italic">kalpa</span> after <span class="Italic">kalpa.</span> By His incarnation and potential activities, the complete ingredients of creation, namely time, space, cause, result, mind, the gross and subtle elements and their interactional modes of nature-goodness, passion and ignorance-and then the senses and their reservoir source, the gigantic universal form as the second incarnation Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and all living beings, both moving and standing, which come out of the second incarnation, all became manifested. Ultimately, all these creative elements and the creation itself are but potential manifestations of the Supreme Lord; nothing is independent of the control of the Supreme Being. This first incarnation in the material creation, namely K&#257;ra&#7751;&#257;r&#7751;ava&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, is the plenary part of the original Personality of Godhead, &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, described in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span></B> (5.48) as follows:</div><A NAME="25668"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">yasyaika-ni&#347;vasita-k&#257;lam ath&#257;valambya<br>j&#299;vanti loma-vilaj&#257; jagad-a&#7751;&#7693;a-n&#257;th&#257;&#7717;<br>vi&#7779;&#7751;ur mah&#257;n sa iha yasya kal&#257;-vi&#347;e&#7779;o<br>govindam &#257;di-puru&#7779;a&#7745; tam aha&#7745; bhaj&#257;mi</div></div><A NAME="25669"></A><div class="After-Verse">All the innumerable universes are maintained only during the breathing period of Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, or K&#257;ra&#7751;&#257;r&#7751;ava&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, who is only a plenary part of Govinda, the original Personality of Godhead Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The less intelligent man is surprised to see the wonderful actions of material phenomena, as the aborigines are fearful of a great thunderbolt, a great and gigantic banyan tree, or a great lofty mountain in the jungle. For such undeveloped human beings, merely the slight display of the Lord's potency is captivating. A still more advanced person is captivated by the powers of the demigods and goddesses. Therefore, those who are simply astonished by the powers of anything in the creation of the Lord, without any factual information of the Lord Himself, are known as <span class="Italic">&#347;aktas,</span> or worshipers of the great powers. The modern scientist is also captivated by the wonderful actions and reactions of natural phenomena and therefore is also a <span class="Italic">&#347;akta.</span> These lower-grade persons gradually rise to become <span class="Italic">saur&#299;yas</span> (worshipers of the sun-god) or <span class="Italic">g&#257;&#7751;apatyas</span> (worshipers of the mass of people as <span class="Italic">janat&#257; jan&#257;rdana</span> or <span class="Italic">daridra-n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a,</span> etc., in the form of Ga&#7751;apati) and then rise to the platform of worshiping Lord &#346;iva in search for the ever-existing soul, and then to the stage of worshiping Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Supersoul, etc., without any information of Govinda, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who is the original Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. In other ways some are worshipers of race, nationality, birds, beasts, evil spirits, satans, etc. The general worship of &#346;anideva, the lord of distressful condition, and S&#299;tal&#257;dev&#299;, the goddess of smallpox, is also common to the mass of people, and there are many foolish men who worship the mass of people or the poor class of men. So different persons, societies and communities, etc., worship some of the potent manifestations of the Lord, wrongly accepting the powerful object as God. But in this verse it is advised by Brahm&#257;j&#299; that none of them is the Supreme Lord; they are only borrowed plumes from the original Almighty Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. When the Lord advises in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> to worship Him alone, it is to be understood that worshiping Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a includes worshiping all that is mentioned, because He, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, includes everyone.</div><A NAME="25694"></A><div class="Purport">When the Lord is described as formless in the Vedic literatures, it is to be understood that all these forms mentioned above, within the experience of universal knowledge, are different exhibitions of the Lord's transcendental potencies only, and none of them factually represents the transcendental form of the Lord. But when the Lord actually descends on the earth or anywhere within the universe, the less intelligent class of men also mistake Him to be one of them, and thus they imagine the Transcendence to be formless or impersonal. Factually, the Lord is not formless, nor does He belong to any of the multiforms experienced within the universal forms. One should try to know the truth about the Lord by following the instruction of Brahm&#257;j&#299;.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Therefore they are in my heart.</div><A NAME="25707"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="25708"></A><div class="First">As it was said in the beginning of <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span></B> (<a href="indexcc42.html?g=7394">1.5.8</a>), one cannot be fully satisfied by hearing unless and until one is given a chance to hear of the transcendental activities of the Lord. So Brahm&#257;j&#299; is also trying, in this verse, to stress the importance of narrating the transcendental pastimes of the Lord as He comes and manifests Himself here on the surface of the material planets. Every living entity has a tendency to hear pleasing messages, and as such almost every one of us is inclined to hear news and talks broadcast by the radio stations. But the difficulty is that no one is satisfied at heart by hearing all those messages. The cause of such dissatisfaction is the incompatibility of the message with the innermost stratum of the living soul. This transcendental literature is especially prepared by &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva to give the utmost satisfaction to the people in general by narration of the activities of the Lord, as instructed by &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada Muni to &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva. Such activities of the Lord are principally of two varieties. One concerns the mundane manifestation of the material creative force, and the other deals with His pastimes in the form of different incarnations in terms of the time and place. There are innumerable incarnations of the Lord, like the waves of the river flowing constantly in and out. Less intelligent persons take more interest in the creative forces of the Lord in the material world, and, being disconnected from their relationship with the Lord, they put forward many theories of the creation in the name of scientific research. The devotees of the Lord, however, know well how the creative forces work concurrently by the action and reaction of the material energy of the Lord. Therefore they take more interest in the transcendental activities of the Lord as He incarnates Himself on the surface of the material world. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the history of such activities of the Lord, and people who take interest in hearing <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> clear their hearts of accumulated mundane filth.

Lord Brahm&#257; is the first demigod, and Hira&#7751;y&#257;k&#7779;a is the first demon in this universe. Only under certain conditions do the planets float as weightless balls in the air, and as soon as these conditions are disturbed, the planets may fall down in the Garbhodaka Ocean, which covers half the universe. The other half is the spherical dome within which the innumerable planetary systems exist. The floating of the planets in the weightless air is due to the inner constitution of the globes, and the modernized drilling of the earth to exploit oil from within is a sort of disturbance by the modern demons and can result in a greatly harmful reaction to the floating condition of the earth. A similar disturbance was created formerly by the demons headed by Hira&#7751;y&#257;k&#7779;a (the great exploiter of the gold rush), and the earth was detached from its weightless condition and fell down into the Garbhodaka Ocean. The Lord, as maintainer of the whole creation of the material world, therefore assumed the gigantic form of a boar with a proportionate snout and picked up the earth from within the water of Garbhodaka. &#346;r&#299; Jayadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, the great Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava poet, sang as follows:</div><A NAME="25728"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">vasati da&#347;ana-&#347;ikhare dhara&#7751;&#299; tava lagn&#257;<br>&#347;a&#347;ini kala&#7749;ka-kaleva nimagn&#257;<br>ke&#347;ava dh&#7771;ta-&#347;&#363;kara-r&#363;pa<br>jaya jagad&#299;&#347;a hare</div></div><A NAME="25729"></A><div class="After-Verse">"O Ke&#347;ava!

The incarnation of the Lord is not the concocted idea of fanciful men who create an incarnation out of imagination. The incarnation of the Lord appears under certain extraordinary circumstances like the above-mentioned occasion, and the incarnation performs a task which is not even imaginable by the tiny brain of mankind. The modern creators of the many cheap incarnations may take note of the factual incarnation of God as the gigantic boar with a suitable snout to carry the planet earth.</div><A NAME="25731"></A><div class="Purport">When the Lord appeared to pick up the earth, the demon of the name Hira&#7751;y&#257;k&#7779;a tried to create a disturbance in the methodical functions of the Lord, and therefore he was killed by being pierced by the Lord's tusk. According to &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;, the demon Hira&#7751;y&#257;k&#7779;a was killed by the hand of the Lord. Therefore his version is that after being killed by the hand of the Lord, the demon was pierced by the tusk. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura confirms this version.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

He spoke to His mother about self-realization, by which, in that very lifetime, she became fully cleansed of the mud of the material modes and thereby achieved liberation, the path of Kapila.</div><A NAME="25758"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="25759"></A><div class="First">The instructions of Lord Kapila to His mother Devah&#363;ti are fully described in the Third Canto (Chapters 25-32) of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> and anyone who follows the instructions can achieve the same liberation obtained by Devah&#363;ti.

The scriptures are meant for this purpose. Foolish, unintelligent persons make their own interpretations by imagination and thus mislead their followers, causing them to remain in the dungeon of material existence. However, simply by following the instructions imparted by Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a or Lord Kapila, one can obtain the highest benefit, even today.</div><A NAME="25760"></A><div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">&#257;tma-gatim</span> is significant in the sense of perfect knowledge of the Supreme. One should not be satisfied simply by knowing the qualitative equality of the Lord and the living being. One should know the Lord as much as can be known by our limited knowledge. It is impossible for the Lord to be known perfectly as He is, even by such liberated persons as &#346;iva or Brahm&#257;, so what to speak of other demigods or men in this world. Still, by following the principles of the great devotees and the instructions available in the scriptures, one can know to a considerable extent the features of the Lord. His Lordship Kapila, the incarnation of the Lord, instructed His mother fully about the personal form of the Lord, and thereby she realized the personal form of the Lord and was able to achieve a place in the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka where, Lord Kapila predominates. Every incarnation of the Lord has His own abode in the spiritual sky. Therefore Lord Kapila also has His separate Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planet. The spiritual sky is not void. There are innumerable Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets, and in each of them the Lord, by His innumerable expansions, predominates, and the pure devotees who are there also live in the same style as the Lord and His eternal associates.</div><A NAME="25761"></A><div class="Purport">When the Lord descends personally or by His personal plenary expansions, such incarnations are called <span class="Italic">a&#7745;&#347;a, kal&#257;, gu&#7751;a, yuga</span> and <span class="Italic">manvantara</span> incarnations, and when the Lord's associates descend by the order of the Lord, such incarnations are called <span class="Italic">&#347;akty&#257;ve&#347;a</span> incarnations. But in all cases all the incarnations are supported by the invulnerable statements of the authorized scriptures, and not by any imagination of some self-interested propagandist. Such incarnations of the Lord, in either of the above categories, always declare the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be the ultimate truth. The impersonal conception of the supreme truth is just a process of negation of the form of the Lord from the mundane conception of the supreme truth.</div><A NAME="25762"></A><div class="Purport">The living entities, by their very constitution, are spiritually as good as the Lord, and the only difference between them is that the Lord is always supreme and pure, without contamination by the modes of material nature, whereas the living entities are apt to be contaminated by association with the material modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. This contamination by the material modes can be washed off completely by knowledge, renunciation and devotional service. Devotional service to the Lord is the ultimate issue, and therefore those who are directly engaged in the devotional service of the Lord not only acquire the necessary knowledge in spiritual science, but also attain detachment from material connection and are thus promoted to the kingdom of God by complete liberation, as stated in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexee26.html?g=4817">14.26</a>):</div><A NAME="25763"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">m&#257;&#7745; ca yo 'vyabhic&#257;re&#7751;a<br>bhakti-yogena sevate<br>sa gu&#7751;&#257;n samat&#299;tyait&#257;n<br>brahma-bh&#363;y&#257;ya kalpate</div></div><A NAME="25764"></A><div class="After-Verse">Even in the nonliberated stage, a living entity can be directly engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Personality of Godhead Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a or His plenary expansions like R&#257;ma and Narasi&#7745;ha.

And by the grace of the lotus feet of the Lord, many Yadus, Haihayas, etc., became so purified that they obtained both material and spiritual blessings.</div><A NAME="25777"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="25778"></A><div class="First">Transcendental relations between the Personality of Godhead and the living entities are eternally established in five different affectionate humors, which are known as <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;nta, d&#257;sya, sakhya, v&#257;tsalya</span> and <span class="Italic">m&#257;dhurya.</span> The sage Atri was related with the Lord in the affectionate <span class="Italic">v&#257;tsalya</span> humor, and therefore, as a result of his devotional perfection, he was inclined to have the Personality of Godhead as his son. The Lord accepted his prayer, and He gave Himself as the son of Atri. Such a relation of sonhood between the Lord and His pure devotees can be cited in many instances. And because the Lord is unlimited, He has an unlimited number of father-devotees. Factually the Lord is the father of all living entities, but out of transcendental affection and love between the Lord and His devotees, the Lord takes more pleasure in becoming the son of a devotee than in becoming one's father. The father actually serves the son, whereas the son only demands all sorts of services from the father; therefore a pure devotee who is always inclined to serve the Lord wants Him as the son, and not as the father. The Lord also accepts such service from the devotee, and thus the devotee becomes more than the Lord. The impersonalists desire to become one with the Supreme, but the devotee becomes more than the Lord, surpassing the desire of the greatest monist. Parents and other relatives of the Lord achieve all mystic opulences automatically because of their intimate relationship with the Lord. Such opulences include all details of material enjoyment, salvation and mystic powers. Therefore, the devotee of the Lord does not seek them separately, wasting his valuable time in life. The valuable time of one's life must therefore be fully engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Then other desirable achievements are automatically gained. But even after obtaining such achievements, one should be on guard against the pitfall of offenses at the feet of the devotees. The vivid example is Haihaya, who achieved all such perfection in devotional service but, because of his offense at the feet of a devotee, was killed by Lord Para&#347;ur&#257;ma. The Lord became the son of the great sage Atri and became known as Datt&#257;treya.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Celestial beauties, the companions of Cupid, went to try to break His vows, but they were unsuccessful, for they saw that many beauties like them were emanating from Him, the Personality of Godhead.</div><A NAME="25806"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="25807"></A><div class="First">The Lord, being the source of everything that be, is the origin of all austerities and penances also. Great vows of austerity are undertaken by sages to achieve success in self-realization. Human life is meant for such <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> with the great vow of celibacy, or <span class="Italic">brahmacarya.</span> <span class="Italic">In the rigid life of</span> tapasya, <span class="Italic">there is no place for the association of women.</span> And because human life is meant for <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> for self-realization, factual human civilization, as conceived by the system of <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana-dharma</span> or the school of four castes and four orders of life, prescribes rigid dissociation from woman in three stages of life. In the order of gradual cultural development, one's life may be divided into four divisions: celibacy, household life, retirement, and renunciation. During the first stage of life, up to twenty-five years of age, a man may be trained as a <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master just to understand that woman is the real binding force in material existence. If one wants to get freedom from the material bondage of conditional life, he must get free from the attraction for the form of woman. Woman, or the fair sex, is the enchanting principle for the living entities, and the male form, especially in the human being, is meant for self-realization. The whole world is moving under the spell of womanly attraction, and as soon as a man becomes united with a woman, he at once becomes a victim of material bondage under a tight knot. The desires for lording it over the material world, under the intoxication of a false sense of lordship, specifically begin just after the man's unification with a woman. The desires for acquiring a house, possessing land, having children and becoming prominent in society, the affection for community and the place of birth, and the hankering for wealth, which are all like phantasmagoria or illusory dreams, encumber a human being, and he is thus impeded in his progress toward self-realization, the real aim of life. The <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;ri,</span> or a boy from the age of five years, especially from the higher castes, namely from the scholarly parents (the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span>), the administrative parents (the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span>), or the mercantile or productive parents (the <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas</span>), is trained until twenty-five years of age under the care of a bona fide <span class="Italic">guru</span> or teacher, and under strict observance of discipline he comes to understand the values of life along with taking specific training for a livelihood. The <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> is then allowed to go home and enter householder life and get married to a suitable woman. But there are many <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;s</span> who do not go home to become householders but continue the life of <span class="Italic">nai&#7779;&#7789;hika-brahmac&#257;r&#299;s,</span> without any connection with women. They accept the order of <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa,</span> or the renounced order of life, knowing well that combination with women is an unnecessary burden that checks self-realization. Since sex desire is very strong at a certain stage of life, the <span class="Italic">guru</span> may allow the <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> to marry; this license is given to a <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> who is unable to continue the way of <span class="Italic">nai&#7779;&#7789;hika-brahmacarya,</span> and such discriminations are possible for the bona fide <span class="Italic">guru.</span> A program of so-called family planning is needed. The householder who associates with woman under scriptural restrictions, after a thorough training of <span class="Italic">brahmacarya,</span> cannot be a householder like cats and dogs. Such a householder, after fifty years of age, would retire from the association of woman as a <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha</span> to be trained to live alone without the association of woman. When the practice is complete, the same retired householder becomes a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;,</span> strictly separate from woman, even from his married wife. Studying the whole scheme of disassociation from women, it appears that a woman is a stumbling block for self-realization, and the Lord appeared as N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a to teach the principle of womanly disassociation with a vow in life. The demigods, being envious of the austere life of the rigid <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;s,</span> would try to cause them to break their vows by dispatching soldiers of Cupid. But in the case of the Lord, it became an unsuccessful attempt when the celestial beauties saw that the Lord can produce innumerable such beauties by His mystic internal potency and that there was consequently no need to be attracted by others externally. There is a common proverb that a confectioner is never attracted by sweetmeats. The confectioner, who is always manufacturing sweetmeats, has very little desire to eat them; similarly, the Lord, by His pleasure potential powers, can produce innumerable spiritual beauties and not be the least attracted by the false beauties of material creation. One who does not know alleges foolishly that Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a enjoyed women in His <span class="Italic">r&#257;sa-l&#299;l&#257;</span> in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, or with His sixteen thousand married wives at Dv&#257;rak&#257;.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Lord &#346;iva, thus being angry at him, glanced at Cupid in great wrath, and at once the body of Cupid was annihilated. Although Lord &#346;iva was so powerful, he was unable to get free from the effects of such wrath. But in the behavior of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u there is no incident of such wrath at any time. On the contrary, Bh&#7771;gu Muni tested the tolerance of the Lord by purposely kicking His chest, but instead of being angry at Bh&#7771;gu Muni the Lord begged his pardon, saying that Bh&#7771;gu Muni's leg might have been badly hurt because His chest is too hard. The Lord has the sign of the foot of <span class="Italic">bh&#7771;gup&#257;da</span> as the mark of tolerance. The Lord, therefore, is never affected by any kind of wrath, so how can there be any place for lust, which is less strong than wrath? When lust or desire is not fulfilled, there is the appearance of wrath, but in the absence of wrath how can there be any place for lust? The Lord is known as <span class="Italic">&#257;pta-k&#257;ma,</span> or one who can fulfill His desires by Himself. He does not require anyone's help to satisfy His desires. The Lord is unlimited, and therefore His desires are also unlimited. All living entities but the Lord are limited in every respect; how then can the limited satisfy the desires of the unlimited? The conclusion is that the Absolute Personality of Godhead has neither lust nor anger, and even if there is sometimes a show of lust and anger by the Absolute, it should be considered an absolute benediction.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

His stepmother did not like the King's patting her stepson, so she dragged him out, saying that he could not claim to sit on the lap of the King because he was not born out of her womb. The little boy felt insulted by this act of his stepmother. Nor did his father make any protest, for he was too attached to his second wife. After this incident, Prince Dhruva went to his own mother and complained. His real mother also could not take any step against this insulting behavior, and so she wept. The boy inquired from his mother how he could sit on the royal throne of his father, and the poor queen replied that only the Lord could help him. The boy inquired where the Lord could be seen, and the queen replied that it is said that the Lord is sometimes seen by great sages in the dense forest.

Prince Dhruva was initiated by N&#257;rada into chanting the hymn composed of eighteen letters, namely <span class="Italic">o&#7745; namo bhagavate v&#257;sudev&#257;ya,</span> and Lord V&#257;sudeva incarnated Himself as P&#7771;&#347;nigarbha, the Personality of Godhead with four hands, and awarded the prince a specific planet above the seven stars.

This planet, although within the material world, will not be annihilated at the time of devastation, but will remain fixed in its place. And because it is a Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planet never to be annihilated, it is worshiped even by the denizens of the seven stars situated below the Dhruva planet, as well as by the planets which are even above the Dhruva planet.

The scriptures like <span class="Italic">Manu-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> and other authorized books of the great sages were guiding principles for ruling the subjects, and there was no need for less intelligent persons to manufacture a code of law in the name of democracy. The less intelligent mass of people have very little knowledge of their own welfare, as a child has very little knowledge of its future well-being. The experienced father guides the innocent child towards the path of progress, and the childlike mass of people need similar guidance.

Such <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> were not paid servants of the king, and therefore they had the strength to dictate to the king on the principles of scriptures.

This <span class="Italic">ja&#7693;a-yoga</span> involves practicing becoming like a dumb stone and not being affected by material reactions. Just as a stone is indifferent to all kinds of attacks and reattacks of external situations, similarly one practices <span class="Italic">ja&#7693;a-yoga</span> by tolerating voluntary infliction of pain upon the material body.

But the real purpose of such <span class="Italic">ja&#7693;a-yoga</span> practice is to get free from all material affection and to be completely situated in the self. At the last stage of his life, Emperor &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva wandered like a dumb madman, unaffected by all kinds of bodily mistreatment. Seeing him like a madman, wandering naked with long hair and a long beard, less intelligent children and men in the street used to spit on him and urinate on his body.

But the stool of his body was fragrant like the smell of fragrant flowers, and a saintly person would recognize him as a <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa,</span> one in the highest state of human perfection. One who is not able to make his stool fragrant should not, however, imitate Emperor &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva.

The whole process of <span class="Italic">yoga,</span> under whatever heading it may be, is to control the unbridled material senses and thus prepare oneself for self-realization. In this age specifically, this <span class="Italic">ja&#7693;a-yoga</span> cannot be of any practical value, but on the other hand the practice of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> is feasible because it is just suitable for this age.

But Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu derived Brahm&#257;j&#299;'s benediction in a roundabout way, almost equal to becoming an immortal being. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was sure that he would not be killed by any man or demigod or by any kind of known weapon, nor would he die in day or night. The Lord, however, assumed the incarnation of half-man and half-lion, which was beyond the imagination of a materialistic demon like Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, and thus, keeping pace with the benediction of Brahm&#257;j&#299;, the Lord killed him. He killed him on His lap, so that he was killed neither on the land nor on the water nor in the sky. The demon was pierced by N&#7771;si&#7745;ha's nails, which were beyond the human weapons imaginable by Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu. The literal meaning of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu is one who is after gold and soft bedding, the ultimate aim of all materialistic men. Such demonic men, who have no relationship with God, gradually become puffed up by material acquisitions and begin to challenge the authority of the Supreme Lord and torture those who are devotees of the Lord. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja happened to be the son of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, and because the boy was a great devotee, his father tortured him to the best of his ability. In this extreme situation, the Lord assumed the incarnation of N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva, and just to finish the enemy of the demigods, the Lord killed Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu in a manner beyond the demon's imagination.

The leader of the elephants was much distressed when he was attacked by the crocodile. Although the elephant is always stronger than the crocodile, the latter is stronger than the elephant when it is in the water. And because the elephant was a great devotee of the Lord in his previous birth, he was able to chant the holy name of the Lord by dint of his past good deeds. Every living entity is always distressed in this material world because this place is such that at every step one has to meet with some kind of distress. But one who is supported by his past good deeds engages himself in the devotional service of the Lord, as confirmed in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index3bf4.html?g=2604">7.16</a>). Those who are supported by impious acts cannot be engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, even though they are distressed. This is also confirmed in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index8b11.html?g=2595">7.15</a>). The Personality of Godhead Hari appeared at once on the back of His eternal bearer, Garu&#7693;a, and delivered the elephant.</div><A NAME="25944"></A><div class="Purport">The elephant was conscious of his relation with the Supreme Lord. He addressed the Lord as <span class="Italic">&#257;di-puru&#7779;a,</span> or the original enjoyer. Both the Lord and the living beings are conscious and are therefore enjoyers, but the Lord is the original enjoyer because He is the creator of everything. In a family, both the father and his sons are undoubtedly enjoyers but the father is the original enjoyer, and the sons are subsequent enjoyers. A pure devotee knows well that everything in the universe is the property of the Lord and that a living entity can enjoy a thing as ordained by the Lord. A living being cannot even touch a thing which is not allotted to him. This idea of the original enjoyer is explained very nicely in the <span class="Italic">&#298;&#347;opani&#7779;ad.</span> One who knows this difference between the Lord and himself never accepts anything without first offering it to the Lord.</div><A NAME="25945"></A><div class="Purport">The elephant addressed the Lord as <span class="Italic">akhila-loka-n&#257;tha,</span> or the Lord of the universe, who is therefore the Lord of the elephant also. The elephant, being a pure devotee of the Lord, specifically deserved to be saved from the attack of the crocodile, and because it is a promise of the Lord that His devotee will never be vanquished, it was quite befitting that the elephant called upon the Lord to protect him, and the merciful Lord also at once responded. The Lord is the protector of everyone, but He is the first protector of one who acknowledges the superiority of the Lord instead of being so falsely proud as to deny the superiority of the Lord or to claim to be equal to Him. He is ever superior. A pure devotee of the Lord knows this difference between the Lord and himself. Therefore a pure devotee is given first preference because of his full dependence, whereas the person who denies the existence of the Lord and declares himself the Lord is called <span class="Italic">asura,</span> and as such he is given protection by the strength of limited power subject to the sanction of the Lord. Since the Lord is superior to everyone, His perfection is also superior. No one can imagine it.</div><A NAME="25946"></A><div class="Purport">The elephant addressed the Lord as <span class="Italic">t&#299;rtha-&#347;rava&#7717;,</span> or "as famous as a place of pilgrimage." People go to places of pilgrimage in order to be delivered from the reactions of unknown sinful acts. But one can be freed from all sinful reactions simply by remembering His holy name. The Lord is therefore as good as the holy places of pilgrimage. One can be free from all sinful reactions after reaching a place of pilgrimage, but one can have the same benefit at home or at any place simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord. For a pure devotee, there is no need to go to the holy place of pilgrimage. He can be delivered from all sinful acts simply by remembering the Lord in earnestness. A pure devotee of the Lord never commits any sinful acts, but because the whole world is full of the sinful atmosphere, even a pure devotee may commit a sin unconsciously, as a matter of course. One who commits sinful acts consciously cannot be worthy of being a devotee of the Lord, but a pure devotee who unconsciously does something sinful is certainly delivered by the Lord because a pure devotee remembers the Lord always.</div><A NAME="25947"></A><div class="Purport"><JD:"Destination-444">The Lord's holy name is called <span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;a-ma&#7749;gala.</span> This means that one receives everything auspicious simply by hearing the holy name.

The Lord descends on this earth and acts like others in connection with the activities of the world just to create subject matters for hearing about Him; otherwise the Lord has nothing to do in this world, nor has He any obligation to do anything.

Such literatures cannot do good to anyone; on the contrary, they agitate the young mind unnecessarily and increase the modes of passion and ignorance, leading to increasing bondage to the material conditions.

The Lord, as the proprietor of everything, could take from Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja all the land he possessed, but he did not do so because Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja possessed all those lands by king's rights. When Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was asked by Lord V&#257;mana for such small charity, Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja's spiritual master, namely &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya, objected to this proposal because he knew that V&#257;manadeva was Vi&#7779;&#7751;u Himself, pretending to be a beggar. Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja did not agree to abide by the order of his spiritual master when he understood that the beggar was Vi&#7779;&#7751;u Himself, and he at once agreed to give Him in charity the land requested. By this agreement Lord V&#257;mana covered all the lands of the universe with His first two steps and then asked Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja where to place the third step. Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was very glad to receive the Lord's remaining step upon his head, and thus Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, instead of losing everything he possessed, was blessed by the Lord's becoming his constant companion and doorman. So, by giving everything to the cause of the Lord, one does not lose anything, but he gains everything that he could never otherwise expect.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

One cannot possess all this illusory paraphernalia, created by <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> permanently. Such a possessor is more illusioned in the matter of his self-realization; therefore one should possess less or nothing, so that one may be free from artificial prestige. We are contaminated in the material world by association with the three modes of material nature. Therefore, the more one spiritually advances by devotional service to the Lord, in exchange for his temporary possessions, the more one is freed from the attachment of material illusion. To achieve this stage of life one must be firmly convinced about spiritual existence and its permanent effects. To know exactly the permanency of spiritual existence, one must voluntarily practice possessing less or only the minimum to maintain one's material existence without difficulty. One should not create artificial needs. That will help one be satisfied with the minimum. Artificial needs of life are activities of the senses. The modern advancement of civilization is based on these activities of the senses, or, in other words, it is a civilization of sense gratification. Perfect civilization is the civilization of <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;,</span> or the soul proper. The civilized man of sense gratification is on an equal level with animals because animals cannot go beyond the activities of the senses. Above the senses is the mind. The civilization of mental speculation is also not the perfect stage of life because above the mind is the intelligence, and the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> gives us information of the intellectual civilization. The Vedic literatures give different directions for the human civilization, including the civilization of the senses, of the mind, of the intelligence, and of the soul proper. The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> primarily deals with the intelligence of man, leading one to the progressive path of civilization of the spirit soul. And <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the complete human civilization dealing with the subject matter of the soul proper. As soon as a man is raised to the status of the civilization of the soul, he is fit to be promoted to the kingdom of God, which is described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as per the above verses.</div><A NAME="25996"></A><div class="Purport">The primary information of the kingdom of God informs us that there is no need of sun, moon or electricity, which are all necessary in this material world of darkness.

He was very much pleased with you, due to your intense proportion of devotional service. He also explained unto you, lucidly, the full science of devotional service, which is especially understandable by persons who are souls surrendered unto Lord V&#257;sudeva, the Personality of Godhead.</div><A NAME="26010"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="26011"></A><div class="First">The devotee and devotional service are two correlative terms. Unless one is inclined to be a devotee of the Lord, he cannot enter into the intricacies of devotional service. Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a wanted to explain the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> which is the science of devotional service, unto &#346;r&#299; Arjuna because Arjuna was not only His friend but a great devotee as well. The whole process is that all living entities, being constitutionally parts and parcels of the supreme living being, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, have proportionately minute independence of action also. So the preliminary qualification for entering into the devotional service of the Lord is that one become a willing cooperator, and as such one should voluntarily cooperate with persons who are already engaged in the transcendental devotional service of the Lord. By cooperating with such persons, the prospective candidate will gradually learn the techniques of devotional service, and with the progress of such learning one becomes proportionately free from the contamination of material association. Such a purificatory process will establish the prospective candidate in firm faith and gradually elevate him to the stage of transcendental taste for such devotional service. Thus he acquires a genuine attachment for the devotional service of the Lord, and his conviction carries him on to the point of ecstasy, just prior to the stage of transcendental love.</div><A NAME="26012"></A><div class="Purport">Such knowledge of devotional service may be divided into two sections, namely preliminary knowledge of the nature of devotional service and the secondary knowledge of its execution. <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is in relation with the Personality of Godhead, His beauty, fame, opulence, dignity, attraction and transcendental qualities which attract one towards Him for exchanges of love and affection. There is a natural affinity of the living entity for the loving service of the Lord. This affinity becomes artificially covered by the influence of material association, and <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> helps one very genuinely remove that artificial covering. Therefore it is particularly mentioned herein that <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> acts like the lamp of transcendental knowledge. These two sections of transcendental knowledge in devotional service become revealed to a person who is a soul surrendered unto V&#257;sudeva; as it is said in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index4112.html?g=2631">7.19</a>), such a great soul, fully surrendered unto the lotus feet of V&#257;sudeva, is very, very rare.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

He is the <span class="Italic">nitya,</span> or the chief eternal amongst all other eternals. He is the chief one, and all others are the dependent many. The many eternals are supported by the one eternal, and thus both the eternals are qualitatively one. Due to such oneness, both the eternals constitutionally have a complete range of sentiments, but the difference is that the sentiments of the chief eternal are different in quantity from the sentiments of the dependent eternals. When R&#257;macandra was angry and showed His red-hot eyes, the whole ocean became heated with that energy, so much so that the aquatics within the great ocean felt the heat, and the personified ocean trembled in fear and offered the Lord an easy path for reaching the enemy's city. The impersonalists will see havoc in this red-hot sentiment of the Lord because they want to see negation in perfection. Because the Lord is absolute, the impersonalists imagine that in the Absolute the sentiment of anger, which resembles mundane sentiments, must be conspicuous by absence. Due to a poor fund of knowledge, they do not realize that the sentiment of the Absolute Person is transcendental to all mundane concepts of quality and quantity. Had Lord R&#257;macandra's sentiment been of mundane origin, how could it disturb the whole ocean and its inhabitants? Can any mundane red-hot eye generate heat in the great ocean? These are factors to be distinguished in terms of the personal and impersonal conceptions of the Absolute Truth. As it is said in the beginning of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> the Absolute Truth is the source of everything, so the Absolute Person cannot be devoid of the sentiments that are reflected in the temporary mundane world. Rather, the different sentiments found in the Absolute, either in anger or in mercy, have the same qualitative influence, or, in other words, there is no mundane difference of value because these sentiments are all on the absolute plane. Such sentiments are definitely not absent in the Absolute, as the impersonalists think, making their mundane estimation of the transcendental world.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The Lord comes in His original form, with beautiful black hair. And just to expand His transcendental glories, He acts extraordinarily. No one can properly estimate how great He is.</div><A NAME="26114"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="26115"></A><div class="First">This verse is especially describing the appearance of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and His immediate expansion, Lord Baladeva. Both Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and Lord Baladeva are one Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is omnipotent, and He expands Himself in innumerable forms and energies, and the whole unit is known as the one Supreme Brahman. Such extensions of the Lord are divided into two divisions, namely personal and differential. The personal expansions are called the <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-tattvas,</span> and the differential expansions are called the <span class="Italic">j&#299;va-tattvas.</span> And in such expansional activity, Lord Baladeva is the first personal expansion of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div><A NAME="26116"></A><div class="Purport">In the <span class="Italic">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u Pur&#257;&#7751;a,</span> as well as in the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata,</span> both K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and Baladeva are mentioned as having beautiful black hair, even in Their advanced age. The Lord is called <span class="Italic">anupalak&#7779;ya-m&#257;rga&#7717;</span> or, in still more technical Vedic terms, <span class="Italic">av&#257;&#7749;-manas&#257; gocara&#7717;:</span> one who is never to be seen or realized by the limited sense perception of the people in general. In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index109a.html?g=2685">7.25</a>) it is said by the Lord, <span class="Italic">n&#257;ha&#7745; prak&#257;&#347;a&#7717; sarvasya yogam&#257;y&#257;-sam&#257;v&#7771;ta&#7717;.</span> In other words, He reserves the right of not being exposed to anyone and everyone. Only the bona fide devotees can know Him by His specific symptoms, and out of many, many such symptoms, one symptom is mentioned here in this verse, that the Lord is <span class="Italic">sita-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-ke&#347;a&#7717;,</span> or one who is observed always with beautiful black hair. Both Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and Lord Baladeva have such hair on Their heads, and thus even in advanced age They appeared like young boys sixteen years old. That is the particular symptom of the Personality of Godhead. In the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> it is stated that although He is the oldest personality among all living entities, He always looks like a new, youthful boy. That is the characteristic of a spiritual body. The material body is symptomized by birth, death, old age and diseases, but the spiritual body is conspicuous by the absence of those symptoms. Living entities who reside in the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;halokas in eternal life and bliss have the same type of spiritual body, without being affected by any signs of old age. It is described in the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (Canto Six) that the party of Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas who came to deliver Aj&#257;mila from the clutches of the party of Yamar&#257;ja appeared like youthful boys, corroborating the description in this verse. It is ascertained thus that the spiritual bodies in the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;halokas, either of the Lord or of the other inhabitants, are completely distinct from the material bodies of this world. Therefore, when the Lord descends from that world to this world, He descends in His spiritual body of <span class="Italic">&#257;tma-m&#257;y&#257;,</span> or internal potency, without any touch of the <span class="Italic">bahira&#7749;g&#257;-m&#257;y&#257;,</span> or external, material energy. The allegation that the impersonal Brahman appears in this material world by accepting a material body is quite absurd. Therefore the Lord, when He comes here, has not a material body, but a spiritual body. The impersonal <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> is only the glaring effulgence of the body of the Lord, and there is no difference in quality between the body of the Lord and the impersonal ray of the Lord, called <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti.</span></div><A NAME="26117"></A><div class="Purport">Now the question is why the Lord, who is omnipotent, comes here to diminish the burden created upon the world by the unscrupulous kingly order. Certainly the Lord does not need to come here personally for such purposes, but He actually descends to exhibit His transcendental activities in order to encourage His pure devotees, who want to enjoy life by chanting the glories of the Lord. In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index57c5.html?g=3102">9.13</a>-14) it is stated that the <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;s,</span> great devotees of the Lord, take pleasure in chanting of the activities of the Lord. All Vedic literatures are meant for turning one's attention towards the Lord and His transcendental activities. Thus the activities of the Lord, in His dealings with worldly people, create a subject matter for discussion by His pure devotees.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

All these activities are impossible for anyone other than the Lord Himself.</div><A NAME="26130"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="26131"></A><div class="First">One cannot manufacture a God by one's mental speculation or by numerical votes, as has become a practice for the less intelligent class of men. God is God eternally, and an ordinary living entity is eternally a part and parcel of God. God is one without a second, and the ordinary living entities are many without number. All such living entities are maintained by God Himself, and that is the verdict of the Vedic literatures. When K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was on the lap of His mother, the demon P&#363;tan&#257; appeared before His mother and prayed to nurture the child in her lap. Mother Ya&#347;od&#257; agreed, and the child was transferred onto the lap of P&#363;tan&#257;, who was in the garb of a respectable lady. P&#363;tan&#257; wanted to kill the child by smearing poison on the nipple of her breast. But when everything was complete, the Lord sucked her breast along with her very air of life, and the demon's gigantic body, said to be as long as six miles, fell down. But Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a did not need to expand Himself to the length of the she-demon P&#363;tan&#257;, although He was quite competent to extend Himself more than six miles long. In His V&#257;mana incarnation He posed Himself as a dwarf <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> but when He took possession of His land, promised by Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, He expanded His footstep to the top of the universe, extending over thousands and millions of miles. So it was not very difficult for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a to perform a miracle by extending His bodily feature, but He had no desire to do it because of His deep filial love for His mother, Ya&#347;od&#257;. If Ya&#347;od&#257; had seen K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in her lap extending six miles to cope with the she-demon P&#363;tan&#257;, then the natural filial love of Ya&#347;od&#257; would have been hurt because in that way Ya&#347;od&#257; would have come to know that her so-called son, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, was God Himself. And with the knowledge of the Godhood of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Ya&#347;od&#257;may&#299; would have lost the temper of her love for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as a natural mother. But as far as Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is concerned, He is God always, either as a child on the lap of His mother, or as the coverer of the universe, V&#257;manadeva. He does not require to become God by undergoing severe penances, although some men think of becoming God in that way. By undergoing severe austerities and penances, one cannot become one or equal with God, but one can attain most of the godly qualities. A living being can attain godly qualities to a large extent, but he cannot become God, whereas K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, without undergoing any type of penance, is God always, either in the lap of His mother or growing up or at any stage of growth.</div><A NAME="26132"></A><div class="Purport">So at the age of only three months He killed the &#346;aka&#7789;&#257;sura, who had remained hidden behind a cart in the house of Ya&#347;od&#257;may&#299;. And when He was crawling and was disturbing His mother from doing household affairs, the mother tied Him with a grinding pestle, but the naughty child dragged the pestle up to a pair of very high <span class="Italic">arjuna</span> trees in the yard of Ya&#347;od&#257;may&#299;, and when the pestle was stuck between the pair of trees, they fell down with a horrible sound. When Ya&#347;od&#257;may&#299; came to see the happenings, she thought that her child had been saved from the falling trees by the mercy of the Lord, without knowing that the Lord Himself, crawling in her yard, had wreaked the havoc. So that is the way of reciprocation of love affairs between the Lord and His devotees. Ya&#347;od&#257;may&#299; wanted to have the Lord as her child, and the Lord played exactly like a child in her lap, but at the same time played the part of the Almighty Lord whenever it was so required. The beauty of such pastimes was that the Lord fulfilled everyone's desire. In the case of felling the gigantic <span class="Italic">arjuna</span> trees, the Lord's mission was to deliver the two sons of Kuvera, who were condemned to become trees by the curse of N&#257;rada, as well as to play like a crawling child in the yard of Ya&#347;od&#257;, who took transcendental pleasure in seeing such activities of the Lord in the very yard of her home.</div><A NAME="26133"></A><div class="Purport">The Lord in any condition is Lord of the universe, and He can act as such in any form, gigantic or small, as He likes.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Actually there was no arrest of Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja by Varu&#7751;a because the inhabitants of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana were always engaged in thinking of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, in constant meditation on the Personality of Godhead in a particular form of <span class="Italic">samadhi,</span> or trance of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> They had no fear of the miseries of material existence.

Sacrifices recommended in the Vedic literature for satisfaction of the demigods are a sort of inducement to the sacrificers to realize the existence of higher authorities. The demigods are engaged by the Lord as controlling deities of material affairs, and according to the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> when a demigod is worshiped the process is accepted as the indirect method for worshiping the Supreme Lord. But when the Supreme Lord is worshiped directly there is no need of worshiping the demigods or offering them sacrifices as recommended in particular circumstances. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a therefore advised the inhabitants of Vrajabh&#363;mi not to offer any sacrifices to the heavenly King Indra. But Indra, not knowing Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in Vrajabh&#363;mi, was angry at the inhabitants of Vrajabh&#363;mi and tried to avenge the offense. But, competent as the Lord was, He saved the inhabitants and animals of Vrajabh&#363;mi by His personal energy and proved definitely that anyone directly engaged as a devotee of the Supreme Lord need not satisfy any other demigods, however great, even to the level of Brahm&#257;, or &#346;iva. Thus this incident definitely proved without a doubt that Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the Personality of Godhead and that He was so in all circumstances, as a child on the lap of His mother, as a boy 7 years old, and as an old man of 125 years of age.

The Lord would appear (and He does so whenever He appears) with all His associates and potencies. Therefore the rebellious souls, like the demons and demoniac men, mentioned by names like Pralamba, would be killed either by the Lord Himself or by His associates. All these affairs will be clearly explained in the Tenth Canto. But we should know well that all the above-mentioned living entities killed would attain salvation either by being merged in the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> of the Lord or being allowed to enter into the abodes of the Lord called Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;has. This has already been explained by Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva (First Canto). All persons who participated in the Battlefield of Kuruk&#7779;etra or otherwise with the Lord or with Baladeva, etc., would benefit by attaining spiritual existence according to the situation of their minds at the time of death. Those who recognized the Lord would enter Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha, and those who estimated the Lord as only a powerful being would attain salvation by merging into the spiritual existence of the impersonal <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> of the Lord. But every one of them would get release from material existence. Since such is the benefit of those who played with the Lord inimically, one can imagine what would be the position of those who devoutly served the Lord in transcendental relationship with Him.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Advancement of material comforts of the body is activity in the mode of ignorance according to the laws of material nature. Real advancement of knowledge means progress of knowledge in self-realization. But in the age of Kali the less intelligent men mistakenly consider the short lifetime of one hundred years (now factually reduced to about forty or sixty years) to be all in all. They are less intelligent because they have no information of the eternity of life; they identify with the temporary material body existing for forty years and consider it the only basic principle of life. Such persons are described as equal to the asses and bulls.

According to &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;, the Buddha incarnation mentioned in this verse appeared in a different Kali age. In the duration of life of one Manu there are more than seventy-two Kali-yugas, and in one of them the particular type of Buddha mentioned here would appear. Lord Buddha incarnates at a time when the people are most materialistic and preaches common-sense religious principles. Such <span class="Italic">ahi&#7745;s&#257;</span> is not a religious principle itself, but it is an important quality for persons who are actually religious. It is a common-sense religion because one is advised to do no harm to any other animal or living being because such harmful actions are equally harmful to he who does the harm. But before learning these principles of nonviolence one has to learn two other principles, namely to be humble and to be prideless. Unless one is humble and prideless, one cannot be harmless and nonviolent. And after being nonviolent one has to learn tolerance and simplicity of living. One must offer respects to the great religious preachers and spiritual leaders and also train the senses for controlled action, learning to be unattached to family and home, and enacting devotional service to the Lord, etc. At the ultimate stage one has to accept the Lord and become His devotee; otherwise there is no religion. In religious principles there must be God in the center; otherwise simple moral instructions are merely subreligious principles, generally known as <span class="Italic">upadharma,</span> or nearness to religious principles.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The sum and substance of such conditions is godlessness. Even the so-called saints and higher castes of the social orders, generally known as the <span class="Italic">dvija janas</span> or the twice-born, will become atheists. As such, all of them will practically forget even the holy name of the Lord, and what to speak of His activities. The higher castes of society, namely the intelligent class of men guiding the destinies of the social orders, the administrative class of men guiding the law and order of the society, and the productive class of men guiding the economic development of the society, must all be properly well versed in knowledge of the Supreme Lord, knowing factually His name, quality, pastimes, entourage, paraphernalia and personalities. The saints and the higher castes or orders of the society are judged by their proportion of knowledge in the science of God, or <span class="Italic">tattva j&ntilde;&#257;na,</span> and not by any kind of birthright or bodily designations. Such designations, without any knowledge of the science of God and practical knowledge of devotional service, are considered to be all decorations of dead bodies. And when there is too much inflation of these decorated dead bodies in society, there develop so many anomalies in the progressive, peaceful life of the human being. Because of the lack of training or culture in the upper section of the social orders, they are no more to be designated as the <span class="Italic">dvija janas,</span> or the twice-born. The significance of being twice-born has been explained in many places in these great literatures, and again one is reminded herewith that birth, executed by the sex life of the father and the mother, is called animal birth. But such animal birth and progress of life on the animal principles of eating, sleeping, fearing and mating (without any scientific culture of spiritual life) is called the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> life, or, to be more explicit, the uncultured life of the lower class of men. It is stated herein that the governmental power of society in the Kali-yuga will be passed over to the uncultured, godless laborer classes of men, and thus the <span class="Italic">n&#7771;devas</span> (or the ministers of the government) will be the <span class="Italic">v&#7771;&#7779;alas,</span> or the uncultured lower-class men of society. No one can expect any peace and prosperity in a human society full of uncultured lower classes of men. The symptoms of such uncultured social animals are already in vogue, and it is the duty of the leaders of men to take note of it and try to reform the social order by introducing the principles of twice-born men trained in the science of God consciousness. This can be done by expanding the culture of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> all over the world. In the degraded condition of human society, the Lord incarnates as the Kalki <span class="Italic">avat&#257;ra</span> and kills all the demonic without mercy.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Certainly it is not by mental speculation, nor by any attempt by dint of limited instruments of knowledge. By the limited instruments of knowledge (either the senses or the material instruments like microscopes and telescopes) one cannot even fully know the Lord's material potencies, which are manifested before our eyes. For example there are many millions and billions of planets far, far beyond the scientist's calculation. But these are only the manifestations of the Lord's material energy. What can the scientist hope to know of the spiritual potency of the Lord by such material efforts? Mental speculations, by adding some dozens of "if's" and "maybe's," cannot aid the advancement of knowledge-on the contrary, such mental speculations will only end in despair by dismissing the case abruptly and declaring the nonexistence of God. The sane person, therefore, ceases to speculate on subjects beyond the jurisdiction of his tiny brain, and as a matter of course he tries to learn to surrender unto the Supreme Lord, who alone can lead one to the platform of real knowledge. In the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads</span> it is clearly said that the Supreme Personality of Godhead can never be known simply by working very hard and taxing the good brain, nor can He be known simply by mental speculation and jugglery of words. The Lord is knowable only by one who is a surrendered soul. Herein Brahm&#257;j&#299;, the greatest of all material living beings, acknowledges this truth. Therefore, the fruitless spoiling of energy by pursuing the path of experimental knowledge must be given up. One should gain knowledge by surrendering unto the Lord and by acknowledging the authority of the persons mentioned herein. The Lord is unlimited and, by the grace of the <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;,</span> helps the surrendered soul to know Him proportionately with the advance of one's surrender.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The answer to such questions or inquiries is given herein very properly. The Personality of Godhead may not be present before one's eyes, but if one is sincere in wanting such guidance the Lord will send a bona fide person who can guide one properly back home, back to Godhead. There is no need of material qualifications for making progress on the path of spiritual realization. In the material world, when one accepts some particular type of service, he is required to possess some particular type of qualification also. Without this one is unfit for such service. But in the devotional service of the Lord the only qualification required is surrender. Surrendering oneself is in one's own hand. If one likes, he can surrender immediately, without delay, and that begins his spiritual life. The bona fide representative of God is as good as God Himself. Or, in other words, the loving representative of the Lord is more kind and more easy to approach. A sinful soul cannot approach the Lord directly, but such a sinful man can very easily approach a pure devotee of the Lord. And if one agrees to put himself under the guidance of such a devotee of the Lord, he can also understand the science of God and can also become like the transcendental pure devotee of the Lord and thus get his liberation back to Godhead, back home for eternal happiness.</div><A NAME="26370"></A><div class="Purport">So realization of the science of Godhead and relief from the unnecessary, useless struggle for existence are not at all difficult for the willing candidate.

That is certainly the ultimate phase of the supreme enjoyer, the Personality of Godhead. He is eternally void of all disturbances and fearless. He is complete consciousness as opposed to matter. Uncontaminated and without distinctions, He is the principle primeval cause of all causes and effects, in whom there is no sacrifice for fruitive activities and in whom the illusory energy does not stand.</div><A NAME="26385"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="26386"></A><div class="First">The supreme enjoyer, the Personality of Godhead, is the Supreme Brahman or the <span class="Italic">summum bonum</span> because of His being the supreme cause of all causes. The conception of impersonal Brahman realization is the first step, due to His distinction from the illusory conception of material existence. In other words, impersonal Brahman is a feature of the Absolute distinct from the material variegatedness, just as light is a conception distinct from its counterpart, darkness. But the light has its variegatedness, which is seen by those who further advance in the light, and thus the ultimate realization of Brahman is the source of the Brahman light, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the <span class="Italic">summum bonum</span> or the ultimate source of everything. Therefore, meeting the Personality of Godhead includes the realization of the impersonal Brahman as realized at first in contrast with material inebriety. The Personality of Godhead is the third step of Brahman realization. As explained in the First Canto, one must understand all three features of the Absolute-Brahman, Param&#257;tm&#257; and Bhagav&#257;n.</div><A NAME="26387"></A><div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Pratibodha-m&#257;tram</span> is just the opposite conception of material existence. In matter there are material miseries, and thus in the first realization of Brahman there is the negation of such material inebrieties, and there is a feeling of eternal existence distinct from the pangs of birth and death, disease and old age. That is the primary conception of impersonal Brahman.</div><A NAME="26388"></A><div class="Purport">The Supreme Lord is the Supreme Soul of everything, and therefore in the supreme conception affection is realized. The conception of affection is due to the relationship of soul to soul. A father is affectionate to his son because there is some relationship of nearness between the son and the father. But that sort of affection in the material world is full of inebriety. When the Personality of Godhead is met, the fullness of affection becomes manifested because of the reality of the affectionate relationship. He is not the object of affection by material tinges of body and mind, but He is the full, naked, uncontaminated object of affection for all living entities because He is the Supersoul, or Param&#257;tm&#257;, within everyone's heart. In the liberated state of affairs, the full-fledged affection for the Lord is awakened.</div><A NAME="26389"></A><div class="Purport">As such, there is an unlimited flow of everlasting happiness, without the fear of its being broken as we have experienced here in the material world. The relationship with the Lord is never broken; thus there is no grief and no fear. Such happiness is inexplicable by words, and there can be no attempt to generate such happiness by fruitive activities by arrangements and sacrifices. But we must also know that happiness, unbroken happiness exchanged with the Supreme Person, the Personality of Godhead as described in this verse, transcends the impersonal conception of the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads</span> the description is more or less negation of the material conception of things, but this is not denial of the transcendental senses of the Supreme Lord. Herein also the same is affirmed in the statements about the material elements; they are all transcendental, free from all contamination of material identification. And also the liberated souls are not devoid of senses; otherwise there cannot be any reciprocation of unhampered spiritual happiness exchanged between them in spontaneous unbroken joy. All the senses, both of the Lord and of the devotees, are without material contamination. They are so because they are beyond the material cause and effects, as clearly mentioned herein (<span class="Italic">sad-asata&#7717; param</span>). The illusory, material energy cannot work there, being ashamed before the Lord and His transcendental devotees. In the material world the sense activities are not without grief, but here it is clearly said that the senses of the Lord and the devotees are without any grief. There is a distinct difference between the material and spiritual senses. And one should understand it without denying the spiritual senses because of a material conception.</div><A NAME="26390"></A><div class="Purport">The senses in the material world are surcharged with material ignorance. In every way, the authorities have recommended purification of the senses from the material conception. In the material world the senses are manipulated for individual and personal satisfaction, whereas in the spiritual world the senses are properly used for the purpose for which they were originally meant, namely the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. Such sensual activities are natural, and therefore sense gratification there is uninterrupted and unbroken by material contamination because the senses are spiritually purified. And such satisfaction of the senses is equally shared by the transcendental reciprocators. Since the activities are unlimited and constantly increasing, there is no scope for material attempts or artificial arrangements. Such happiness of transcendental quality is called <span class="Italic">brahma-saukhyam,</span> which will he clearly described in the Fifth Canto.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Similarly, those who are poor in transcendental realization speculate on the mind or meditate by controlling the senses. But they do not know that such control of the senses and achievement of spiritual perfection are simultaneously made possible as soon as one is factually engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Person, the Personality of Godhead. It is for this reason that the great liberated souls also desire to be associated in hearing and chanting the activities of the Lord. The example of Indra is very appropriate in this connection. King Indra of heaven is the controlling deity or demigod for arranging clouds and supplying rains in the universe, and as such he does not have to take the trouble to dig a well for his personal water supply. For him, digging a well for a water supply is simply ludicrous. Similarly, those who are factually engaged in the loving service of the Lord have attained the ultimate goal of life, and for them there is no need of mental speculation to find out the true nature of God or His activities. Nor do such devotees have to meditate upon the imaginary or real identity of the Lord. Because they are factually engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, the Lord's pure devotees have already achieved the results of mental speculation and meditation. The real perfection of life is therefore to be engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

As long as the living entity is in material existence, actions performed by him are rewarded in the next life, or even in the present life. Similarly, in his spiritual life also actions are rewarded by the Lord by the five kinds of liberation. Even the impersonalist cannot achieve the desired merging into the existence of the Supreme without being favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is confirmed in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index477f.html?g=1523">4.11</a>) that the Lord awards similar results, as one desires, in one's present life.

The devotees, therefore, following their constitutional instincts, achieve the desired goal of becoming servitors, friends, fathers, mothers or conjugal lovers of the Lord. The devotional service of the Lord involves nine transcendental processes, such as hearing and chanting, and by performing such easy and natural devotional services the devotees achieve the highest perfectional results, far, far superior to merging into the existence of Brahman. The devotees are therefore never advised to indulge in speculating upon the nature of the Supreme or artificially meditating on the the void.</div><A NAME="26419"></A><div class="Purport">One should not, however, mistakenly think that after the annihilation of this present body there is no body by which one can associate with the Lord face to face.

According to the desires of the living being, the material body develops. So from the spirit soul the material body comes into existence, generated from the living force. Since the living being is eternal, he exists just like the air within the body. Air is within and without the body. Therefore when the external covering, the material body, is vanquished, the living spark, like the air within the body, continues to exist.

Fanatics or fools may consider the Lord's activities in relation with the external energy to be useless for them, and they may falsely claim to be higher participants in the internal energy of the Lord, but factually the Lord's activities in relation with the external energy and the internal energy are equally good. On the other hand, those who are not completely free from the clutches of the Lord's external energy should devoutly hear regularly about the activities of the Lord in relation with the external energy. They should not foolishly jump up to the activities of the internal energy, falsely attracted by the Lord's internal potential activities like His <span class="Italic">r&#257;sa-l&#299;l&#257;.</span> The cheap reciters of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> are very much enthusiastic about the Lord's internal potential activities, and the pseudodevotees, absorbed in material sense enjoyment, falsely jump to the stage of liberated souls and thus fall down deeply into the clutches of external energy.</div><A NAME="26480"></A><div class="Purport">Some of them think that to hear about the pastimes of the Lord means to hear about His activities with the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> or about His pastimes like lifting the Govardhana Hill, and they have nothing to do with the Lord's plenary expansions as the <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;&#257;vat&#257;ras</span> and Their pastimes of the creation, maintenance or annihilation of the material worlds. But a pure devotee knows that there is no difference between the pastimes of the Lord, either in <span class="Italic">r&#257;sa-l&#299;l&#257;</span> or in creation, maintenance or destruction of the material world. Rather, the descriptions of such activities of the Lord as the <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;&#257;vat&#257;ras</span> are specifically meant for persons who are in the clutches of the external energy. Topics like the <span class="Italic">r&#257;sa-l&#299;l&#257;</span> are meant for the liberated souls and not for the conditioned souls. The conditioned souls, therefore, must hear with appreciation and devotion the Lord's pastimes in relationship with the external energy, and such acts are as good as the hearing of <span class="Italic">r&#257;sa-l&#299;l&#257;</span> in the liberated stage.

That is the way of understanding Vedic knowledge. It comes down from the Lord by disciplic succession, and this transcendental knowledge is distributed to the world by this descending process. There is no chance, however, to receive the Vedic knowledge from mental speculators. Therefore, wherever N&#257;rada Muni goes, he represents himself as authorized by the Lord, and his appearance is as good as that of the Supreme Lord. Similarly, the disciplic succession which strictly follows the transcendental instruction is the bona fide chain of disciplic succession, and the test for such bona fide spiritual masters is that there should be no difference between the instruction of the Lord originally imparted to His devotee and that which is imparted by the authority in the line of disciplic succession.

Not only were all the pure devotees like N&#257;rada self-realized souls, but they were engaged in preaching work automatically by spiritual impetus, and thus they delivered many poor souls entangled in the material modes. They became so powerful because they sincerely followed the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> principles by regular hearing and worshiping.

The idea is that devotional service to the Lord is the only method of cleansing the heart for good.

But such difficulties are very gladly suffered by the devotees in preaching because in such activities, although apparently very severe, the devotees of the Lord feel transcendental pleasure because the Lord is satisfied. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja suffered greatly, but still he never forgot the lotus feet of the Lord. This is because a pure devotee of the Lord is so purified in his heart that he cannot leave the shelter of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in any circumstances.

The progress of culturing knowledge by the <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s</span> or the bodily gymnastics by the <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> are ultimately given up by the respective performers, but a devotee of the Lord cannot give up the service of the Lord, for he is ordered by his spiritual master. Pure devotees like N&#257;rada and Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu take up the order of the spiritual master as the sustenance of life. They do not mind what becomes of the future of their lives.

He is spiritually whole, with no difference between His body and His soul, unlike the conditioned soul.

How was the process first begun?</div><A NAME="26596"></A><div class="Purport">In the process of devotional service, the first step is to take shelter of the spiritual master and then inquire from the spiritual master all about the process. This inquiry is essential for immunity to all kinds of offenses on the path of devotional service. Even if one is fixed in devotional service like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, he must still inquire from the realized spiritual master all about this. In other words, the spiritual master must also be well versed and learned so that he may be able to answer all these inquiries from the devotees. Thus one who is not well versed in the authorized scriptures and not able to answer all such relevant inquiries should not pose as a spiritual master for the matter of material gain.

It has been described in many places before this that the Lord assumed a gigantic body, like that of K&#257;ra&#7751;odaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, from whose hair pores innumerable universes have generated. The body of Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is described as sprouting the lotus stem within which all the planets of the universe remain, and at the top of the stem is the lotus flower on which Lord Brahm&#257; is born. In the creation of the material world the Supreme Lord undoubtedly assumes a gigantic body, and living entities also get bodies, big or small, according to necessity. For example, an elephant gets a gigantic body according to its needs, and so also an ant gets its body according to its needs. Similarly, if the Personality of Godhead assumes a gigantic body to accommodate the universes or the planets of a particular universe, there is no difference in the principle of assuming or accepting a particular type of body in terms of necessity. A living being and the Lord cannot be distinguished simply by the difference in the magnitude of the body. So the answer depends on the specific significance of the body of the Lord, as distinguished from the body of the common living being.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The various actions and reactions of work in the mode of goodness are generally known as pious work with devotional service, culture of knowledge with devotional service, mystic powers with devotional service and (at last) devotional service unmixed with any other varieties of goodness.

That is the significance of the whole scientific system of four castes and four social orders. The value of such scientific divisions of human society can be ascertained only in terms of the proportionate development of devotional service to the Lord. Any person employed in government service, including the president, is a part and parcel of the entire government. Everyone is a government servant, but no one is the government himself.

Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was not to be carried away by the sentiments of the common man to accept an incarnation of the Lord very cheaply. Instead he wished to accept the incarnation of the Lord by symptoms mentioned in the Vedic literatures and confirmed by an <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya</span> like &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;. The Lord descends by His internal energy without any obligation to the laws of material nature, and thus His activities are also uncommon. The specific activities of the Lord are mentioned, and one should know that the activities of the Lord and the Lord Himself are identical due to being on the absolute plane. Thus to hear the activities of the Lord means to associate with the Lord directly, and association with the Lord directly means purification from material contamination.

Even the animals may be included in devotional service to the Lord, and the best example is set by &#346;r&#299; Vajr&#257;&#7749;gaj&#299;, or Hanum&#257;n, the great devotee of Lord &#346;r&#299; R&#257;ma. As we have already discussed, even the aborigines and cannibals can also be engaged in the devotional service of the Lord if they happen to be under the guidance of a genuine devotee of the Lord. In the <span class="Italic">Skanda Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> there is a narration that a hunter in the jungle became the most enlightened devotee of the Lord by the guidance of &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada Muni. Therefore devotional service to the Lord can be equally shared by every living being.</div><A NAME="26756"></A><div class="Purport">Religious affiliation in terms of different countries and cultural circumstances is obviously not the common religion of the human being; rather, the basic principle is devotional service. Even if a particular type of religious principle does not recognize the supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the followers still have to obey the disciplinary principles laid down by a particular leader. Such a leader of a religious sect is never the supreme leader because such a circumstantial leader comes to the position of leadership after undergoing some penance. The Supreme Personality of Godhead does not, however, require to be under disciplinary action to become leader, as we see in the activities of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div><A NAME="26757"></A><div class="Purport">The occupational duties of the castes and the orders of society, following the principles of livelihood, also depend on the principle of devotional service. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is stated that a person can achieve the highest perfection of life simply by awarding the results of his occupational duty unto the devotional service of the Lord. People following the principles of devotional service to the Lord can never be put into difficulty, and thus there cannot be any question of <span class="Italic">&#257;pad-dharma,</span> or religion in distress. As will be explained in this book by the greatest authority, &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, there is no religion save and except the devotional service of the Lord, though this may be presented in different forms.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The devotees of the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, do not directly practice the process of mystic powers, but, by the grace of the Lord, His devotee can defeat even a great <span class="Italic">yoge&#347;vara</span> like Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni, who picked a quarrel with Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ambar&#299;&#7779;a and wanted to show the wonderful achievements of his mystic powers.

Similarly, at the time of Draupad&#299;'s precarious position, when she was attacked by the Kurus who wanted to see her naked in the open assembly of the royal order, the Lord saved her from being stripped by supplying an unlimited length of sari to cover her.

One who is firmly situated in the devotional service of the Lord can very easily execute the function of conditional life. Living the conditional life is just like plying a boat in the middle of the ocean. One is completely at the mercy of the ocean, and at every moment there is every chance of being drowned in the ocean by slight agitation. If the atmosphere is all right, the boat can ply very easily, undoubtedly, but if there is some storm, fog, wind or cloud, there is every possibility of being drowned in the ocean. No one can control the whims of the ocean, however one may be materially well equipped. One who has crossed the oceans by ship may have sufficient experience of such dependence upon the mercy of the ocean. But one can ply over the ocean of material existence by the grace of the Lord very easily, without any fear of storm or fog. It all depends on the will of the Lord; no one can help if there is some unfortunate danger in the state of conditional life. The devotees of the Lord, however, cross the ocean of material existence without anxiety because a pure devotee is always protected by the Lord (Bg. <a href="index57c5.html?g=3102">9.13</a>). The Lord gives special attention to His devotees in their activities within material, conditional life (Bg. <a href="index90b5.html?g=3246">9.29</a>). Therefore everyone should take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord and be a pure devotee of the Lord by all means.</div><A NAME="26799"></A><div class="Purport">One should know, therefore, from the expert spiritual master, the advantages and disadvantages of discharging devotional service, just as Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it asked his spiritual master, &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;. According to <span class="Italic">Bhakti-ras&#257;m&#7771;ta-sindhu,</span> the science of devotional service, one should not eat more than what he requires to maintain body and soul together. Vegetable diets and milk are sufficient for maintenance of the human body, and therefore one has no need to eat anything more to satisfy the palate. One should also not accumulate money to become puffed up in the material world. One should earn his livelihood easily and honestly, for it is better to become a coolie for an honest livelihood than to become a great man in society by hook and crook. There is no harm if one becomes the richest man in the world by honest dealings, but one should not sacrifice the honest means of livelihood simply to accumulate wealth. Such an endeavor is harmful to devotional service. One should not talk nonsense. A devotee's business is to earn the favor of the Lord. Therefore a devotee should always glorify the Lord in His wonderful creations. A devotee should not decry the creation of the Lord, defying Him by saying that He has created a false world. The world is not false. Factually we have to take so many things from the world for our maintenance, so how we can say that the world is false? Similarly, how can one think of the Lord as being without form? How can one become formless and at the same time have all intelligence and consciousness, direct and indirect? So there are many things for a pure devotee to learn, and he should learn them perfectly from a bona fide personality like &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;.</div><A NAME="26800"></A><div class="Purport">The favorable conditions for discharging devotional service are that one should be very enthusiastic in serving the Lord. The Lord in His form of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu wanted the cult of devotional service to the Lord to be preached all over the world, in every nook and corner, and therefore a pure devotee's duty is to discharge this order as far as possible. Every devotee should be very enthusiastic, not only in performing his daily rituals of devotional service, but in trying to preach the cult peacefully by following in the footsteps of Lord Caitanya. If he is not superficially successful in such an attempt, he should not be deterred from the discharge of his duty. Success or failure has no meaning for a pure devotee because he is a soldier in the field. Preaching the cult of devotional service is something like declaring war against materialistic life. There are different kinds of materialists, such as the fruitive workers, the mental speculators, the mystic jugglers, and so many others. All of them are against the existence of Godhead. They would declare that they are themselves God, although in every step and in every action they are dependent on the mercy of the Lord. Therefore a pure devotee may not associate with such gangs of atheists. A strong devotee of the Lord will not be misled by such atheistic propaganda of the nondevotees, but a neophyte devotee should be very cautious about them. A devotee should see to the right discharge of devotional service under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master and should not stick only to the formalities. Under the direction of the bona fide spiritual master, one should see how much service is being executed, and not simply in the matter of rituals. A devotee should not hanker after anything, but he should be satisfied with things that may automatically come to him by the will of the Lord. That should be the principle of a devotional life. And all these principles are easily learned under the guidance of a spiritual master like &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;.

Contemporary to Vy&#257;sadeva or even prior to him there were many other great sages, such as Gautama, Ka&#7751;&#257;da, Jaimini, Kapila and A&#7779;&#7789;&#257;vakra, and all of them have presented a philosophical path by themselves. Pata&ntilde;jali is also one of them, and all these six great <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is</span> have their own way of thinking, exactly like the modern philosophers and mental speculators. The difference between the six philosophical paths put forward by the renowned sages above mentioned and that of &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, as presented in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> is that all the six sages mentioned above speak the facts according to their own thinking, but &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; presents the knowledge which comes down directly from Brahm&#257;j&#299;, who is known as <span class="Italic">&#257;tma-bh&#363;&#7717;,</span> or born of and educated by the Almighty Personality of Godhead.</div><A NAME="26859"></A><div class="Purport">Vedic transcendental knowledge descends directly from the Personality of Godhead. By His mercy, Brahm&#257;, the first living being in the universe, was enlightened, and from Brahm&#257;j&#299;, N&#257;rada was enlightened, and from N&#257;rada, Vy&#257;sa was enlightened. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; received such transcendental knowledge directly from his father, Vy&#257;sadeva. Thus the knowledge, being received from the chain of disciplic succession, is perfect. One cannot be a spiritual master in perfection unless and until one has received the same by disciplic succession. That is the secret of receiving transcendental knowledge. The six great sages mentioned above may be great thinkers, but their knowledge by mental speculation is not perfect. However perfect an empiric philosopher may be in presenting a philosophical thesis, such knowledge is never perfect because it is produced by an imperfect mind. Such great sages also have their disciplic successions, but they are not authorized because such knowledge does not come directly from the independent Supreme Personality of Godhead, N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. No one can be independent except N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a; therefore no one's knowledge can be perfect, for everyone's knowledge is dependent on the flickering mind. Mind is material and thus knowledge presented by material speculators is never transcendental and can never become perfect. Mundane philosophers, being imperfect in themselves, disagree with other philosophers because a mundane philosopher is not a philosopher at all unless he presents his own theory. Intelligent persons like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it do not recognize such mental speculators, however great they may be, but hear from the authorities like &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, who is nondifferent from the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the <span class="Italic">parampar&#257;</span> system, as is specially stressed in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span></div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

There is no use in nondevotees' meddling with the two topmost Vedic literatures, and therefore &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya did not touch <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> for commentation.

That relationship is just like a dreamer's seeing his own body working.</div><A NAME="26937"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="26938"></A><div class="First">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it's question as to how a living entity began his material life, although he is apart from the material body and mind, is perfectly answered. The spirit soul is distinct from the material conception of his life, but he is absorbed in such a material conception because of being influenced by the external energy of the Lord, called <span class="Italic">&#257;tma-m&#257;y&#257;.</span> This has already been explained in the First Canto in connection with Vy&#257;sadeva's realization of the Supreme Lord and His external energy. The external energy is controlled by the Lord, and the living entities are controlled by the external energy-by the will of the Lord. Therefore, although the living entity is purely conscious in his pure state, he is subordinate to the will of the Lord in being influenced by the external energy of the Lord. In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a>) also the same thing is confirmed; the Lord is present within the heart of every living entity, and all the living entity's consciousness and forgetfulness are influenced by the Lord.</div><A NAME="26939"></A><div class="Purport">Now the next question automatically made will be why the Lord influences the living entity to such consciousness and forgetfulness. The answer is that the Lord clearly wishes that every living entity be in his pure consciousness as a part and parcel of the Lord and thus be engaged in the loving service of the Lord as he is constitutionally made; but because the living entity is partially independent also, he may not be willing to serve the Lord, but may try to become as independent as the Lord is. All the nondevotee living entities are desirous of becoming equally as powerful as the Lord, although they are not fit to become so. The living entities are illusioned by the will of the Lord because they wanted to become like Him. Like a person who thinks of becoming a king without possessing the necessary qualification, when the living entity desires to become the Lord Himself, he is put in a condition of dreaming that he is a king. Therefore the first sinful will of the living entity is to become the Lord, and the consequent will of the Lord is that the living entity forget his factual life and thus dream of the land of utopia where he may become one like the Lord. The child cries to have the moon from the mother, and the mother gives the child a mirror to satisfy the crying and disturbing child with the reflection of the moon. Similarly, the crying child of the Lord is given over to the reflection, the material world, to lord it over as <span class="Italic">karm&#299;</span> and to give this up in frustration to become one with the Lord. Both these stages are dreaming illusions only. There is no necessity of tracing out the history of when the living entity desired this. But the fact is that as soon as he desired it, he was put under the control of <span class="Italic">&#257;tma-m&#257;y&#257;</span> by the direction of the Lord. Therefore the living entity in his material condition is dreaming falsely that this is "mine" and this is "I." The dream is that the conditioned soul thinks of his material body as "I" or falsely thinks that he is the Lord and that everything in connection with that material body is "mine." Thus only in dream does the misconception of "I" and "mine" persist life after life. This continues life after life, as long as the living entity is not purely conscious of his identity as the subordinate part and parcel of the Lord.</div><A NAME="26940"></A><div class="Purport">In his pure consciousness, however, there is no such misconceived dream, and in that pure conscious state the living entity does not forget that he is never the Lord, but that he is eternally the servitor of the Lord in transcendental love.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The external, material energy is represented by her three modes, namely goodness, passion and ignorance. So even in the material nature there is a chance of an independent choice by the living entity, and according to his choice the material energy offers him different varieties of material bodies. There are bodies, 1,100,000 worms and reptiles, 1,000,000 forms of birds, together there are 8,400,000 varieties of bodies in different planets of the universe, and the living entity is traveling by so many transmigrations according to different modes of enjoying spirit within himself. Even in one particular body the living entity changes from childhood to boyhood, from boyhood to youth, from youth to old age and from old age to another body created by his own action. The living entity creates his own body by his personal desires, and the external energy of the Lord supplies him the exact form by which he can enjoy his desires to the fullest extent. The tiger wanted to enjoy the blood of another animal, and therefore, by the grace of the Lord, the material energy supplied him the body of the tiger with facilities for enjoying blood from another animal. Similarly, a living entity desiring to get the body of a demigod in a higher planet can also get it by the grace of the Lord. And if he is intelligent enough, he can desire to get a spiritual body to enjoy the company of the Lord, and he will get it. So the minute freedom of the living entity can be fully utilized, and the Lord is so kind that He will award the living entity the same type of body he desires. The living entity's desiring is like dreaming of a golden mountain. A person knows what a mountain is, and he knows also what gold is. Out of his desire only, he dreams of a golden mountain, and when the dream is over he sees something else in his presence. He finds in his awakened state that there is neither gold nor a mountain, and what to speak of a golden mountain.</div><A NAME="26955"></A><div class="Purport">The different positions of the living entities in the material world under multifarious manifestations of bodies are due to the misconception of "mine" and "I."

In the lower state the conception of "mine" is very prominent, and in the higher state the misconception of "I" is prominent. In the animal state of life the misconception of "mine" is perceivable even in the category of cats and dogs, who fight with one another with the same misconception of "mine." In the lower stage of human life the same misconception is also prominent in the shape of "It is my body," "It is my house," "It is my family," "It is my caste," "It is my nation," "It is my country," and so on. And in the higher stage of speculative knowledge, the same misconception of "mine" is transformed into "I am," or "It is all I am," etc. There are many classes of men comprehending the same misconception of "I" and "mine', in different colors. But the real significance of "I" can be realized only when one is situated in the consciousness of "<span class="Italic">I am the eternal servitor of the Lord.</span>" This is pure consciousness, and the whole Vedic literatures teach us this conception of life.</div><A NAME="26970"></A><div class="Purport">The misconception of "I am the Lord," or "I am the Supreme," is more dangerous than the misconception of "mine." Although there are sometimes directions in the Vedic literatures to think oneself one with the Lord, that does not mean that one becomes identical with the Lord in every respect. Undoubtedly there is oneness of the living entity with the Lord in many respects, but ultimately the living entity is subordinate to the Lord, and he is constitutionally meant for satisfying the senses of the Lord. The Lord therefore asks the conditioned souls to surrender unto Him. Had the living entities not been subordinate to the supreme will, why would the living entity be asked to surrender? Had the living being been equal in all respects, then why was he put under the influence of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span>? We have already discussed many times that the material energy is controlled by the Lord. The <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index652d.html?g=3075">9.10</a>) confirms this controlling power of the Lord over the material nature. Can a living entity who claims to be as good as the Supreme Being control the material nature? The foolish "I" would reply that he will do so in the future. Even accepting that in the future one will be as good a controller of material nature as the Supreme Being, then why is one now under the control of material nature? The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> says that one can be freed from the control of the material nature by surrendering unto the Supreme Lord, but if there is no surrender, then the living entity will never be able to control the material nature. So one must also give up this misconception of "I" by practicing the way of devotional service or firmly being situated in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. A poor man without any employment or occupation may undergo so many troubles in life, but if by chance the same man gets a good service under the government, he at once becomes happy. There is no profit in denying the supremacy of the Lord, who is the controller of all energies, but one should be constitutionally situated in one's own glory, namely to be situated in the pure consciousness of being the eternal servitor of the Lord. In his conditional life the living entity is servant of the illusory <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> and in his liberated state he is the pure, unqualified servant of the Lord. To become untinged by the modes of material nature is the qualification for entering into the service of the Lord. As long as one is a servant of mental concoctions, one cannot be completely free from the disease of "I" and "mine."</div><A NAME="26971"></A><div class="Purport">The Supreme Truth is uncontaminated by the illusory energy because He is the controller of that energy. The relative truths are apt to be engrossed in illusory energy. The best purpose is served, however, when one is directly facing the Supreme Truth, as when one faces the sun. The sun overhead in the sky is full of light, but when the sun is not in the visible sky, all is in darkness. Similarly, when one is face to face with the Supreme Lord, he is freed from all illusions, and one who is not so is in the darkness of illusory <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> The <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexee26.html?g=4817">14.26</a>) confirms this as follows:</div><A NAME="26972"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">m&#257;&#7745; ca yo 'vyabhic&#257;re&#7751;a<br>bhakti-yogena sevate<br>sa gu&#7751;&#257;n samat&#299;tyait&#257;n<br>brahma-bh&#363;y&#257;ya kalpate</div></div><A NAME="26973"></A><div class="After-Verse">So the science of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> of worshiping the Lord, glorifying the Lord, hearing the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> from the right sources (not from the professional man but from a person who is <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> in life) and being always in the association of pure devotees, should be adopted in earnestness. One should not be misled by misconceptions of "I" and "mine." The <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> are fond of the conception of "mine," the <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s</span> are fond of the conception of "I," and both of them are unqualified to be free from the bondage of the illusory energy. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> and, primarily, the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> are both meant for delivering a person from the misconception of "I" and "mine," and &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva transcribed them for the deliverance of the fallen souls. The living entity has to be situated in the transcendental position where there is no more influence of time nor of the material energy. In conditioned life the living entity is subjected to the influence of time in the dream of past, present and future. The mental speculator tries to conquer the influence of time by future speculations of becoming V&#257;sudeva or the Supreme Lord himself by means of culturing knowledge and conquering over ego. But the process is not perfect. The perfect process is to accept Lord V&#257;sudeva as the Supreme in everything, and the best perfection in culturing knowledge is to surrender unto Him because He is the source of everything. Only in that conception can one get rid of the misconception of I and mine. Both <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> confirm it. &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva has specifically contributed to the illusioned living entities the science of God and the process of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> in his great literature <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> and the conditioned soul should fully take advantage of this great science.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The wrong conception of the <span class="Italic">j&#299;v&#257;tm&#257;</span> is to identify the material body with the pure soul, and the wrong conception of Param&#257;tm&#257; is to think Him on an equal level with the living entity. But both misconceptions can be removed by one stroke of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> just as in the sunlight both the sun and the world and everything within the sunlight are properly seen. In the darkness one cannot see the sun, nor himself, nor the world. But in the sunlight one can see the sun, himself and the world around him. &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; therefore says that for purification of both wrong conceptions, the Lord presented His eternal form before Brahm&#257;j&#299;, being fully satisfied by Brahm&#257;'s nondeceptive vow of discharging <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> Except for <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> any method for realization of <span class="Italic">&#257;tma-tattva,</span> or the science of <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;,</span> will prove deceptive in the long run.</div><A NAME="26988"></A><div class="Purport">In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> the Lord says that only by <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> can one know Him perfectly, and then one can enter into the science of God. Brahm&#257;j&#299; undertook great penance in performing <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> and thus he was able to see the transcendental form of the Lord. His transcendental form is one hundred percent spiritual, and one can see Him only by spiritualized vision after proper discharge of <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> or penance, in pure <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> The form of the Lord manifested before Brahm&#257; is not one of the forms with which we have experience in the material world. Brahm&#257;j&#299; did not perform such severe types of penance just to see a form of material production. Therefore the question by Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it about the form of the Lord is answered. The form of the Lord is <span class="Italic">sac-cid-&#257;nanda</span><I> <span class="Italic"></I>[Bs.</I> </span>5.1</I>]<span class="Italic"></I>,</span> or eternal, full of knowledge and full of bliss. But the material form of the living being is neither eternal, nor full of knowledge, nor blissful. That is the distinction between the form of the Lord and that of the conditioned soul. The conditioned soul, however, can regain his form of eternal knowledge and bliss simply by seeing the Lord by means of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span></div><A NAME="26989"></A><div class="Purport">The summary is that due to ignorance the conditioned soul is encaged in the temporary varieties of material forms. But the Supreme Lord has no such temporary form like the conditioned souls. He is always possessed of an eternal form of knowledge and bliss, and that is the difference between the Lord and the living entity. One can understand this difference by the process of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> Brahm&#257; was then told by the Lord the gist of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> in four original verses. Thus <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is not a creation of the mental speculators. The sound of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is transcendental, and the resonance of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is as good as that of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> Thus the topic of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the science of both the Lord and the living entity. Regular reading or hearing of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is also performance of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> and one can attain the highest perfection simply by the association of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> Both &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it attained perfection through the medium of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span></div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

By <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> only can one get the profit of human life, and not by a polished civilization of animal life.

Brahm&#257; was the only living being at that time because there was no other creation and none could be found there except himself. In the beginning of the First Canto, in the First Chapter, first verse, of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> it has already been mentioned that Brahm&#257; was initiated by the Lord from within. The Lord is within every living entity as the Supersoul, and He initiated Brahm&#257; because Brahm&#257; was willing to receive the initiation. The Lord can similarly initiate everyone who is inclined to have it.</div><A NAME="27035"></A><div class="Purport">As already stated, Brahm&#257; is the original spiritual master for the universe, and since he was initiated by the Lord Himself, the message of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is coming down by disciplic succession, and in order to receive the real message of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> one should approach the current link, or spiritual master, in the chain of disciplic succession. After being initiated by the proper spiritual master in that chain of succession, one should engage himself in the discharge of <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> in the execution of devotional service. One should not, however, think himself on the level of Brahm&#257; to be initiated directly by the Lord from inside because in the present age no one can be accepted to be as pure as Brahm&#257;. The post of Brahm&#257; to officiate in the creation of the universe is offered to the most pure living being, and unless one is so qualified one cannot expect to be treated like Brahm&#257;j&#299; directly. But one can have the same facility through unalloyed devotees of the Lord, through scriptural instructions (as revealed in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> especially), and also through the bona fide spiritual master available to the sincere soul. The Lord Himself appears as the spiritual master to a person who is sincere in heart about serving the Lord. Therefore the bona fide spiritual master who happens to meet the sincere devotee should be accepted as the most confidential and beloved representative of the Lord. If a person is posted under the guidance of such a bona fide spiritual master, it may be accepted without any doubt that the desiring person has achieved the grace of the Lord.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

And due to his correct vision, he made no distinction between the Lord and the Lord's instruction. There is no difference between the Lord and sound vibration coming from Him, even though He is not personally present. The best way of understanding is to accept such divine instruction, and Brahm&#257;, the prime spiritual master of everyone, is the living example of this process of receiving transcendental knowledge. The potency of transcendental sound is never minimized because the vibrator is apparently absent. Therefore <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> or <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> or any revealed scripture in the world is never to be accepted as an ordinary mundane sound without transcendental potency.</div><A NAME="27050"></A><div class="Purport">One has to receive the transcendental sound from the right source, accept it as a reality and prosecute the direction without hesitation.

One should be qualified enough to discern such transcendental potency, and either by discriminating or by fortunate chance if one is able to receive the transcendental sound from the bona fide spiritual master, his path of liberation is guaranteed. The disciple, however, must be ready to execute the order of the bona fide spiritual master as Lord Brahm&#257; executed the instruction of his spiritual master, the Lord Himself. Following the order of the bona fide spiritual master is the only duty of the disciple, and this completely faithful execution of the order of the bona fide spiritual master is the secret of success.</div><A NAME="27051"></A><div class="Purport">Lord Brahm&#257; controlled his two grades of senses by means of sense perception and sense organs because he had to engage such senses in the execution of the order of the Lord. Therefore controlling the senses means engaging them in the transcendental service of the Lord. The Lord's order descends in disciplic succession through the bona fide spiritual master, and thus execution of the order of the bona fide spiritual master is factual control of the senses. Such execution of penance in full faith and sincerity made Brahm&#257;j&#299; so powerful that he became the creator of the universe.

The personal abodes of the Lord, known as Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;has, are neither mythical nor material, as conceived by the impersonalists. But realization of the transcendental abodes of the Lord is possible only through devotional service, and thus the devotees enter into such abodes. There is undoubtedly trouble in executing penance. But the trouble accepted in executing <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> is transcendental happiness from the very beginning, whereas the trouble of penance in other processes of self-realization (<span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na-yoga, dhy&#257;na-yoga,</span> etc.), without any Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha realization, ends in trouble only and nothing more.

It is said that Y&#257;j&ntilde;avalkya described the transcendental abode of the Lord to G&#257;rg&#299;, and that the abode of the Lord is situated above the highest planet of the universe, namely Brahmaloka. This abode of the Lord, although described in revealed scriptures like the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> remains only a myth for the less intelligent class of men with a poor fund of knowledge. Herein the word <span class="Italic">sva-d&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;avadbhi&#7717;</span> is very significant. One who has actually realized his self realizes the transcendental form of one's self. Impersonal realization of self and the Supreme is not complete, because it is just an opposite conception of material personalities. The Personality of Godhead and the personalities of devotees of the Lord are all transcendental; they do not have material bodies. The material body is overcast with five kinds of miserable conditions, namely ignorance, material conception, attachment, hatred and absorption. As long as one is overwhelmed by those five kinds of material miseries, there is no question of entering into the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;halokas. The impersonal conception of one's self is just the negation of material personality and is far from the positive existence of personal form. The personal forms of the transcendental abode will be explained in the following verses. Brahm&#257;j&#299; also described the highest planet of the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka as Goloka V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, where the Lord resides as a cowherd boy keeping transcendental <span class="Italic">surabhi</span> cows and surrounded by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune.</div><A NAME="27067"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">cint&#257;ma&#7751;i-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-v&#7771;k&#7779;a-<br>lak&#7779;&#257;v&#7771;te&#7779;u surabh&#299;r abhip&#257;layantam<br>lak&#7779;m&#299;-sahasra-&#347;ata-sambhrama-sevyam&#257;na&#7745;<br>govindam &#257;di-puru&#7779;a&#7745; tam aha&#7745; bhaj&#257;mi</div></div><A NAME="27068"></A><div class="VerseRef">(<span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bs</B>.</span> 5.29)</div><A NAME="27069"></A><div class="After-Verse">The statement of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> <span class="Italic">yad gatv&#257; na nivartante tad dh&#257;ma parama&#7745; mama </I>[</I>Bg</I>. </I><a href="index34f4.html?g=4877">15.6</a></I>]</I>,</span> is also confirmed herewith. <span class="Italic">param</span> means transcendental Brahman.

This universe, containing billions of stars and planets, is one of the billions of such universes clustered together within the compass of the <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva.</span> And all these millions and billions of universes combined together constitute only one fourth of the magnitude of the whole creation of the Lord. There is the spiritual sky also; beyond this sky are the spiritual planets under the names of Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha, and all of them constitute three fourths of the entire creation of the Lord. God's creations are always innumerable. Even the leaves of a tree cannot be counted by a man, nor can the hairs on his head. However, foolish men are puffed up with the idea of becoming God Himself, though unable to create a hair of their own bodies. Man may discover so many wonderful vehicles of journey, but even if he reaches the moon by his much advertised spacecraft, he cannot remain there. The sane man, therefore, without being puffed up, as if he were the God of the universe, abides by the instructions of the Vedic literature, the easiest way to acquire knowledge in transcendence. So let us know through the authority of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> of the nature and constitution of the transcendental world beyond the material sky. In that sky the material qualities, especially the modes of ignorance and passion, are completely absent. The mode of ignorance influences a living entity to the habit of lust and hankering, and this means that in the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;halokas the living entities are free from these two things. As confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> in the <span class="Italic">brahma-bh&#363;ta </I>[</I>SB <a href="index2486.html?g=41459">4.30.20</a></I>]</span></I> stage of life one becomes free from hankering and lamentation. Therefore the conclusion is that the inhabitants of the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets are all <span class="Italic">brahma-bh&#363;ta</span> living entities, as distinguished from the mundane creatures who are all compact in hankering and lamentation. When one is not in the modes of ignorance and passion, one is supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness in the material world. Goodness in the material world also at times becomes contaminated by touches of the modes of passion and ignorance. In the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka, it is unalloyed goodness only.</div><A NAME="27084"></A><div class="Purport">The whole situation there is one of freedom from the illusory manifestation of the external energy. Although illusory energy is also part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, illusory energy is differentiated from the Lord. The illusory energy is not, however, false, as claimed by the monist philosophers. The rope accepted as a snake may be an illusion to a particular person, but the rope is a fact, and the snake is also a fact. The illusion of water on the hot desert may be illusion for the ignorant animal searching for water in the desert, but the desert and water are actual facts. Therefore the material creation of the Lord may be an illusion to the nondevotee, but to a devotee even the material creation of the Lord is a fact, as the manifestation of His external energy. But this energy of the Lord is not all. The Lord has His internal energy also, which has another creation known to be the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;halokas, where there is no ignorance, no passion, no illusion and no past and present. With a poor fund of knowledge one may be unable to understand the existence of such things as the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha atmosphere, but that does not nullify its existence. That spacecraft cannot reach these planets does not mean that there are no such planets, for they are described in the revealed scriptures.</div><A NAME="27085"></A><div class="Purport">As quoted by &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;, we can know from the <span class="Italic">N&#257;rada-pa&ntilde;car&#257;tra</span> that the transcendental world or Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha atmosphere is enriched with transcendental qualities. These transcendental qualities, as revealed through the devotional service of the Lord, are distinct from the mundane qualities of ignorance, passion and goodness. Such qualities are not attainable by the nondevotee class of men. In the <span class="Italic">Padma Pur&#257;&#7751;a, Uttara-kha&#7751;&#7693;a,</span> it is stated that beyond the one-fourth part of God's creation is the three-fourths manifestation. The marginal line between the material manifestation and the spiritual manifestation is the Viraj&#257; River, and beyond the Viraj&#257;, which is a transcendental current flowing from the perspiration of the body of the Lord, there is the three-fourths manifestation of God's creation. This part is eternal, everlasting, without deterioration, and unlimited, and it contains the highest perfectional stage of living conditions. In the <span class="Italic">S&#257;&#7749;khya-kaumud&#299;</span> it is stated that unalloyed goodness or transcendence is just opposite to the material modes. All living entities there are eternally associated without any break, and the Lord is the chief and prime entity. In the <span class="Italic">&#256;gama Pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> also, the transcendental abode is described as follows: The associated members there are free to go everywhere within the creation of the Lord, and there is no limit to such creation, particularly in the region of the three-fourths magnitude. Since the nature of that region is unlimited, there is no history of such association, nor is there end of it.</div><A NAME="27086"></A><div class="Purport">The conclusion may be drawn that because of the complete absence of the mundane qualities of ignorance and passion, there is no question of creation nor of annihilation. In the material world everything is created, and everything is annihilated, and the duration of life between the creation and annihilation is temporary. In the transcendental realm there is no creation and no destruction, and thus the duration of life is eternal unlimitedly. In other words, everything in the transcendental world is everlasting, full of knowledge and bliss without deterioration. Since there is no deterioration, there is no past, present and future in the estimation of time. It is clearly stated in this verse that the influence of time is conspicuous by its absence. The whole material existence is manifested by actions and reactions of elements which make the influence of time prominent in the matter of past, present and future. There are no such actions and reactions of cause and effects there, so the cycle of birth, growth, existence, transformations, deterioration and annihilation-the six material changes-are not existent there. It is the unalloyed manifestation of the energy of the Lord, without illusion as experienced here in the material world. The whole Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha existence proclaims that everyone there is a follower of the Lord. The Lord is the chief leader there, without any competition for leadership, and the people in general are all followers of the Lord. It is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> therefore, that the Lord is the chief leader and all other living entities are subordinate to Him, for only the Lord satisfies all the needs of all other living entities.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

In the conditioned life the malicious life begins from the top, namely bearing malice against the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Personality of Godhead is an established fact in all the revealed scriptures, and in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the personal feature of the Supreme Lord is especially mentioned, so much so that the last portion of the great literature has emphatically stressed that one should surrender unto the Personality of Godhead to be saved from the miseries of life. Unfortunately, persons with impious backgrounds do not believe in the Personality of Godhead, and everyone wants to become God himself without any qualification. This malicious nature in the conditioned soul continues even up to the stage when a person wants to be one with the Lord, and thus even the greatest of the empiric philosophers speculating on becoming one with the Supreme Lord cannot become a <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa</span> because the malicious mind is there. Therefore the <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa</span> stage of life can be attained only by those who are fixed in the practice of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> This <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> begins if a person has the firm conviction that simply discharging devotional service to the Lord in full transcendental love can elevate him to the highest perfectional stage of life. Brahm&#257;j&#299; believed in this art of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga;</span> he believed in the instruction of the Lord to execute <span class="Italic">tapa,</span> and he discharged the function with great penance and thus achieved the great success of seeing the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;halokas and the Lord also by personal experience. No one can reach the abode of the Supreme Lord by any mechanical means of the mind or machine, but one can reach the abode of the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;halokas simply by following the process of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> because the Lord can be realized only through the <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> process. Lord Brahm&#257;j&#299; was actually sitting on his lotus seat, and from there, by executing the process of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> in great seriousness, he could see the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;halokas with all variegatedness as well as the Lord in person and His associates.</div><A NAME="27196"></A><div class="Purport">Following in the footsteps of Lord Brahm&#257;, any person, even up to this day, can attain the same perfection by following the path of the <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa</span> as recommended herein. Lord Caitanya also approved of this method of self-realization for men in this age. One should first, with all conviction, believe in the Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and without making efforts to realize Him by speculative philosophy, one should prefer to hear about Him from the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and later from the text of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> One should hear such discourses from a person <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> and not from the professional man, or from the <span class="Italic">karm&#299;, j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;</span> or <span class="Italic">yog&#299;.</span> That is the secret of learning the science. One does not need to be in the renounced order of life; he can remain in his present condition of life, but he must search out the association of a bona fide devotee of the Lord and hear from him the transcendental message of the Lord with faith and conviction. That is the path of the <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa</span> recommended herein. Amongst various holy names of the Lord, He is also called <span class="Italic">ajita,</span> or one who can never be conquered by anyone else. Yet He can be conquered by the <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa</span> path, as practically realized and shown by the great spiritual master Lord Brahm&#257;.

This can be attained by everyone who is willing to discharge the act of devotional service to the Lord as enjoined in the revealed scriptures that are standard and accepted by the bona fide <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas,</span> spiritual masters. For example, the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> is the approved Vedic literature accepted by all the great <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas,</span> such as &#346;a&#7749;kara, R&#257;m&#257;nuja, Madhva, Caitanya, Vi&#347;van&#257;tha, Baladeva, Siddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; and many others. In that <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the Personality of Godhead, &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, asks that one always be mindful of Him, always be His devotee, always worship Him only, and always bow down before the Lord. And by doing so one is sure to go back home, back to Godhead, without any doubt. In other places also the same order is there, that one give up all other engagements and fully surrender unto the Lord without hesitation. And the Lord will give such a devotee all protection. These are the secrets of attaining the highest perfectional stage. Lord Brahm&#257; exactly followed these principles without any superiority complex, and thus he attained the highest perfectional stage of experiencing the abode of the Lord and the Lord Himself with all His paraphernalia. Impersonal realization of the effulgence of the Lord's body is not the highest perfectional stage, nor is the stage of Param&#257;tm&#257; realization. The word <span class="Italic">man&#299;&#7779;ita</span> is significant. Everyone is falsely or factually proud of his so-called learning. But the Lord says that the highest perfectional stage of learning is to know Him and His abode, devoid of all illusion.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Such penance is the internal potency of the Lord and is nondifferent from Him. Such acts of internal potency are exhibited by nonattachment for material enjoyment. The living entities are encaged in the conditions of material bondage because of their propensity for overlordship. But by engagement in the devotional service of the Lord one becomes detached from this enjoying spirit. The devotees automatically become detached from worldly enjoyment, and this detachment is the result of perfect knowledge. Therefore the penance of devotional service includes knowledge and detachment, and that is the manifestation of the transcendental potency.</div><A NAME="27273"></A><div class="Purport">One cannot enjoy material illusory prosperity if he desires to return home, back to Godhead. One who has no information of the transcendental bliss in the association of the Lord foolishly desires to enjoy this temporary material happiness. In the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta</span> it is said that if someone sincerely wants to see the Lord and at the same time wants to enjoy this material world, he is considered to be a fool only. One who wants to remain here in the material world for material enjoyment has no business entering into the eternal kingdom of God. The Lord favors such a foolish devotee by snatching all that he may possess in the material world. If such a foolish devotee of the Lord tries to recoup his position, then the merciful Lord again snatches away all that he may have possessed. By such repeated failures in material prosperity he becomes very unpopular with his family members and friends. In the material world the family members and friends honor persons who are very successful in accumulating wealth by any means. The foolish devotee of the Lord is thus put into forcible penance by the grace of the Lord, and at the end the devotee becomes perfectly happy, being engaged in the service of the Lord. Therefore penance in devotional service of the Lord, either by voluntary submission or by being forced by the Lord, is necessary for attaining perfection, and thus such penance is the internal potency of the Lord.</div><A NAME="27274"></A><div class="Purport">One cannot, however, be engaged in the penance of devotional service without being completely free from all sins. As stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> only a person who is completely free from all reactions of sins can engage himself in the worship of the Lord. Brahm&#257;j&#299; was sinless, and therefore he faithfully discharged the advice of the Lord, "<span class="Italic">tapa tapa,</span>" and the Lord, being satisfied with him, awarded him the desired result. Therefore only love and penance combined can please the Lord, and thus one is able to attain His complete mercy. He directs the sinless, and the sinless devotee attains the highest perfection of life.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Why, then, are there severe types of penance for the perfection of devotional service? An easygoing life and attainment of perfection in transcendental realization cannot go together. The Lord is more clever than any living entity; therefore He wants to see how painstaking the devotee is in devotional service. The order is received from the Lord, either directly or through the bona fide spiritual master, and to execute that order, however painstaking, is the severe type of penance. One who follows the principle rigidly is sure to achieve success in attaining the Lord's mercy.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The director is not the enjoyer of the fruits of action, for without the Lord's sanction no one can enjoy. For example, in a prohibited area a habituated drunkard puts forward his application to the director of drinking, and the director, considering his case, sanctions only a certain amount of liquor for drinking. Similarly, the whole material world is full of many drunkards, in the sense that each and every one of the living entities has something in his mind to enjoy, and everyone desires the fulfillment of his desires very strongly. The almighty Lord, being very kind to the living entity, as the father is kind to the son, fulfills the living entity's desire for his childish satisfaction. With such desires in mind, the living entity does not actually enjoy, but he serves the bodily whims unnecessarily, without profit. The drunkard does not derive any profit out of drinking, but because he has become a servant of the drinking habit and does not wish to get out of it, the merciful Lord gives him all facilities to fulfill such desires.</div><A NAME="27304"></A><div class="Purport">The impersonalists recommend that one should become desireless, and others recommend banishing desires altogether. That is impossible; no one can banish desires altogether because desiring is the living symptom. Without having desires a living entity would be dead, which he is not. Therefore, living conditions and desire go together. perfection of desires may be achieved when one desires to serve the Lord, and the Lord also desires that every living entity banish all personal desires and cooperate with His desires. That is the last instruction of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> Brahm&#257;j&#299; agreed to this proposal, and therefore he is given the responsible post of creating generations in the vacant universe. Oneness with the Lord therefore consists of dovetailing one's desires with the desires of the Supreme Lord. That makes for the perfection of all desires.</div><A NAME="27305"></A><div class="Purport">The Lord, as the Supersoul in the heart of every living being, knows what is in the mind of each living entity, and no one can do anything without the knowledge of the Lord within.

By a combination of such potential energies of the Lord there is the manifestation of creation, maintenance and annihilation in due course of time and by different agents like Brahm&#257;, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and Mahe&#347;vara. Brahm&#257; creates, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u maintains, and Lord &#346;iva destroys. But all such agents and creative energies are emanations from the Lord, and as such there is nothing except the Lord, or the one supreme source of different diversities. The exact example is the spider and spider's web. The web is created by the spider, and it is maintained by the spider, and as soon as the spider likes, the whole thing is wound up within the spider. The spider is covered within the web. If an insignificant spider is so powerful as to act according to its will, why can't the Supreme Being act by His supreme will in the creation, maintenance and destruction of the cosmic manifestations? By the grace of the Lord, a devotee like Brahm&#257;, or one in his chain of disciplic succession, can understand the almighty Personality of Godhead eternally engaged in His transcendental pastimes in the region of different energies.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

To be instrumental to the direct will of the Lord is the natural constitutional position of the living entity, whereas to be an instrument in the hands of the illusory energy of the Lord is material bondage for the living entity. In that conditioned state, the living entity speculates on the Absolute Truth and His different activities.

Pure devotees of the Lord are therefore not proud of their definite progress, whereas the nondevotee speculator is in the darkness of illusory energy and is very much proud of his misleading knowledge based on speculation without any definite path.

Every living being is eternally related with the Personality of Godhead in one of five different transcendental humors, namely <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;nta, d&#257;sya, sakhya, v&#257;tsalya</span> and <span class="Italic">m&#257;dhurya.</span> We have already discussed these five kinds of humors in relationship with the Personality of Godhead. It is clearly exhibited herein that Lord Brahm&#257; is related to the Personality of Godhead in the transcendental humor of friendship. A pure devotee may be related with the Lord in any one of the transcendental humors, even in the humor of parenthood, but the devotee of the Lord is always a transcendental servitor. No one is equal to or greater than the Lord. That is the version of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> Brahm&#257;j&#299;, although eternally related with the Lord in the transcendental humor of friendship, and although entrusted with the most exalted post of creating different grades of living entities, is still conscious of his position, that he is neither the Supreme Lord nor supremely powerful. It is possible that some extremely powerful personality, within or without the universe, may sometimes show more power than the Lord Himself. Still the pure devotee knows that this power is a <span class="Italic">vibh&#363;ti</span> delegated by the Lord, and such a delegated powerful living entity is never independent. &#346;r&#299; Hanum&#257;nj&#299; crossed the Indian Ocean by jumping over the sea, and Lord &#346;r&#299; R&#257;macandra engaged Himself in marching over the bridge, but this does not mean that Hanum&#257;nj&#299; was more powerful than the Lord. Sometimes the Lord gives extraordinary powers to His devotee, but the devotee knows always that the power belongs to the Personality of Godhead and that the devotee is only an instrument. The pure devotee is never puffed up like the nondevotee class of men who falsely think that they are God. It is astonishing to see how a person who is being kicked by the laws of the Lord's illusory energy at every step can falsely think of becoming one with the Lord. Such thinking is the last snare of the illusory energy offered to the conditioned soul. The first illusion is that he wants to become Lord of the material world by accumulating wealth and power, but when he is frustrated in that attempt he wants to be one with the Lord. So both becoming the most powerful man in the material world and desiring to become one with the Lord are different illusory snares. And because the pure devotees of the Lord are surrendered souls, they are above the illusory snares of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> Because Lord Brahm&#257; is a pure devotee, even though the first dominating deity in the material world and therefore able to do many wonderful things, he would never, like the nondevotee with a poor fund of knowledge, have the audacity to think of becoming one with the Lord. People with a poor fund of knowledge should take lessons from Brahm&#257; when they are puffed up with the false notion of becoming God.</div><A NAME="27374"></A><div class="Purport">Factually Lord Brahm&#257; does not create the living entities. In the beginning of the creation he is empowered to give different bodily shapes to the living entities according to their work during the last millennium. Brahm&#257;j&#299;'s duty is just to wake the living entities from their slumber and to engage them in their proper duty. The different grades of living entities are not created by Brahm&#257;j&#299; by his capricious whims, but he is entrusted with the task of giving the living entities different grades of body so that they can work accordingly. And still he is conscious that he is only instrumental, so that he may not think of himself as the Supreme Powerful Lord.</div><A NAME="27375"></A><div class="Purport">Devotees of the Lord are engaged in the specific duty offered by the Lord, and such duties are successfully carried out without hindrance because they are ordained by the Lord. The credit of success goes not to the doer but to the Lord. But persons with a poor fund of knowledge take the credit of success into their own accounts and give nothing to the credit of the Lord. That is the symptom of the nondevotee class of men.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The necessary paraphernalia for that process is being explained by Me. You may take it up carefully.</div><A NAME="27389"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="27390"></A><div class="First">Lord Brahm&#257; is the topmost devotee of the Lord within the universe, and therefore the Personality of Godhead replied to his four principal inquiries in four important statements, which are known as the original <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> in four verses. These were Brahm&#257;'s questions: (1) What are the forms of the Lord both in matter and in transcendence? (2) How are the different energies of the Lord working? (3) How does the Lord play with His different energies? (4) How may Brahm&#257; be instructed to discharge the duty entrusted to Him? The prelude to the answers is this verse under discussion, wherein the Lord informs Brahm&#257; that knowledge of Him, the Supreme Absolute Truth, as it is stated in the revealed scriptures, is very subtle and cannot be understood unless one is self-realized by the grace of the Lord. The Lord says that Brahm&#257; may take the answers as He explains them. This means that transcendental knowledge of the absolute Supreme Being can be known if it is made known by the Lord Himself. By the mental speculation of the greatest mundane thinkers, the Absolute Truth cannot be understood. The mental speculators can reach up to the standard of impersonal Brahman realization, but, factually, complete knowledge of transcendence is beyond the knowledge of impersonal Brahman. Thus it is called the supreme confidential wisdom. Out of many liberated souls, someone may be qualified to know the Personality of Godhead. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is also said by the Lord Himself that out of many hundreds of thousands of people, one may try for perfection in human life, and out of many liberated souls, one may know Him as He is. Therefore, the knowledge of the Personality of Godhead may be attained by devotional service only. <span class="Italic">Rahasyam</span> means devotional service. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a instructed Arjuna in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> because He found Arjuna to be a devotee and friend. Without such qualifications, one cannot enter into the mystery of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> Therefore, one cannot understand the Personality of Godhead unless one becomes a devotee and discharges devotional service. This mystery is <span class="Italic">love of Godhead.</span> Therein lies the main qualification for knowing the mystery of the Personality of Godhead. And to attain the stage of transcendental love of Godhead, regulative principles of devotional service must be followed. The regulative principles are called <span class="Italic">vidhi-bhakti,</span> or the devotional service of the Lord, and they can be practiced by a neophyte with his present senses. Such regulative principles are mainly based on hearing and chanting of the glories of the Lord. And such hearing and chanting of the glories of the Lord can be made possible in the association of devotees only. Lord Caitanya therefore recommended five main principles for attaining perfection in the devotional service of the Lord. The first is association with devotees (hearing); second is chanting the glories of the Lord; third, hearing <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> from the pure devotee; fourth, residing in a holy place connected with the Lord; and fifth, worshiping the Deity of the Lord with devotion. Such rules and regulations are parts of devotional service. So, as requested by Lord Brahm&#257;, the Personality of Godhead will explain all about the four questions put forward by Brahm&#257;, and others also which are parts and parcels of the same questions.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Even in the material world, the father of many sons discloses the secret of his position to the pet sons. The father discloses the confidence unto the son whom he thinks worthy. An important man in the social order can be known by his mercy only. Similarly, one must be very dear to the Lord in order to know the Lord. The Lord is unlimited; no one can know Him completely, but one's advancement in the transcendental loving service of the Lord can make one eligible to know the Lord. Here we can see that the Lord is sufficiently pleased with Brahm&#257;j&#299;, and therefore He offers His causeless mercy to him so that Brahm&#257;j&#299; may have the factual realization of the Lord by His mercy only.</div><A NAME="27405"></A><div class="Purport">In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> also it is said that a person cannot know the Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead simply by dint of mundane education or intellectual gymnastics. One can know the Supreme Truth if one has unflinching faith in the bona fide spiritual master as well as in the Lord. Such a faithful person, even though illiterate in the mundane sense, can know the Lord automatically by the mercy of the Lord. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> also, it is said that the Lord reserves the right of not being exposed to everyone, and He keeps Himself concealed from the faithless by His <span class="Italic">yoga-m&#257;y&#257;</span> potency.</div><A NAME="27406"></A><div class="Purport">To the faithful the Lord reveals Himself in His form, quality and pastimes. The Lord is not formless, as wrongly conceived by the impersonalist, but His form is not like one that we have experienced.

The mundane wranglers make mundane conceptions of the form of the Lord. It is said in the revealed scriptures that the Lord has no mundane form; therefore persons with a poor fund of knowledge conclude that He must be formless. They cannot distinguish between the mundane form and the spiritual form. According to them, without a mundane form one must be formless. This conclusion is also mundane because formlessness is the opposite conception of form. Negation of the mundane conception does not establish a transcendental fact. In the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> it is said that the Lord has a transcendental form and that He can utilize any one of His senses for any purpose. For example, He can eat with His eyes, and He can see with His leg. In the mundane conception of form, one cannot eat with one's eyes or see with his leg. That is the difference between the mundane body and the spiritual body of <span class="Italic">sac-cid-&#257;nanda</span><I> <span class="Italic"></I>[Bs.</I> </span>5.1</I>]<span class="Italic"></I>.</span> A spiritual body is not formless; it is a different type of body, of which we cannot conceive with our present mundane senses.

Some of the transcendental bodies of the Lord are blackish, and some of them are whitish. Some of them are reddish, and some are yellowish. Some of them are four-handed and some of them two-handed. Some of them are like the fish, and some are like the lion. All these different transcendental bodies of the Lord, without any differential category, are disclosed to the devotees of the Lord by the mercy of the Lord, and thus the impersonalists' false arguments claiming the formlessness of the Supreme Truth do not appeal to a devotee of the Lord, even though such a devotee may not be very advanced in devotional service.</div><A NAME="27409"></A><div class="Purport">The Lord has unlimited numbers of transcendental qualities, and one of them is His affection for His unalloyed devotee. In the history of the mundane world we can appreciate His transcendental qualities. The Lord incarnates Himself for the protection of His devotees and for the annihilation of the faithless. His activities are in relationship with His devotees. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is full of such activities of the Lord in relationship with His devotees, and the nondevotees have no knowledge of such pastimes. The Lord lifted the Govardhana Hill when He was only seven years old and protected His pure devotees at V&#7771;nd&#257;vana from the wrath of Indra, who was overflooding the place with rain. Now this lifting of the Govardhana Hill by a seven-year-old boy may be unbelievable for the faithless, but for the devotees it is absolutely believable. The devotee believes in the almighty potency of the Lord, while the faithless say that the Lord is almighty but do not believe it. Such men with a poor fund of knowledge do not know that the Lord is the Lord eternally and that one cannot become the Lord by meditation for millions of years or by mental speculation for billions of years.</div><A NAME="27410"></A><div class="Purport">The impersonal interpretation of the mundane wranglers is completely refuted in this verse because it is clearly stated here that the Supreme Lord has His qualities, form, pastimes and everything that a person has. All these descriptions of the transcendental nature of the Personality of Godhead are factual realizations by the devotee of the Lord, and by the causeless mercy of the Lord they are revealed to His pure devotee, and to no one else.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Nor was there the material nature, the cause of this creation. That which you see now is also I, the Personality of Godhead, and after annihilation what remains will also be I, the Personality of Godhead.</div><A NAME="27423"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="27424"></A><div class="First">We should note very carefully that the Personality of Godhead is addressing Lord Brahm&#257; and specifying with great emphasis Himself, pointing out that it is He, the Personality of Godhead, who existed before the creation, it is He only who maintains the creation, and it is He only who remains after the annihilation of the creation. Brahm&#257; is also a creation of the Supreme Lord. The impersonalist puts forth the theory of oneness in the sense that Brahm&#257;, also being the same principle of "I" because he is an emanation from the I, the Absolute Truth, is identical with the Lord, the principle of I, and that there is thus nothing more than the principle of I, as explained in this verse. Accepting the argument of the impersonalist, it is to be admitted that the Lord is the creator I and that the Brahm&#257; is the created I. Therefore there is a difference between the two "I's," namely the predominator I and the predominated I. Therefore there are still two I's, even accepting the argument of the impersonalist. But we must note carefully that these two I's are accepted in the Vedic literature (<span class="Italic">Ka&#7789;hopani&#7779;ad</span>) in the sense of quality. The <span class="Italic">Ka&#7789;hopani&#7779;ad</span> says:</div><A NAME="27425"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">nityo nity&#257;n&#257;&#7745; cetana&#347; cetan&#257;n&#257;m<br>eko bah&#363;n&#257;&#7745; yo vidadh&#257;ti k&#257;m&#257;n</div></div><A NAME="27426"></A><div class="After-Verse">The creator "I" and the created "I" are both accepted in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> as qualitatively one because both of them are <span class="Italic">nityas</span> and <span class="Italic">cetanas.</span> But the singular "I" is the creator "I," and the created "I's" are of plural number because there are many "I's" like Brahm&#257; and those generated by Brahm&#257;. It is the simple truth. The father creates or begets a son, and the son also creates many other sons, and all of them may be one as human beings, but at the same time from the father, the son and the grandsons are all different. The son cannot take the place of the father, nor can the grandsons. Simultaneously the father, the son and the grandson are one and different also. As human beings they are one, but as relativities they are different. Therefore the relativities of the creator and the created or the predominator and the predominated have been differentiated in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> by saying that the predominator "I" is the feeder of the predominated "I's," and thus there is a vast difference between the two principles of "I."</div><A NAME="27427"></A><div class="Purport">In another feature of this verse, no one can deny the personalities of both the Lord and Brahm&#257;. Therefore in the ultimate issue both the predominator and predominated are persons. This conclusion refutes the conclusion of the impersonalist that in the ultimate issue everything is impersonal. This impersonal feature stressed by the less intelligent impersonalist school is refuted by pointing out that the predominator "I" is the Absolute Truth and that He is a person. The predominated "I," Brahm&#257;, is also a person, but he is not the Absolute. For realization of one's self in spiritual psychology it may be convenient to assume oneself to be the same principle as the Absolute Truth, but there is always the difference of the predominated and the predominator, as clearly pointed out here in this verse, which is grossly misused by the impersonalists. Brahm&#257; is factually seeing face to face his predominator Lord, who exists in His transcendental eternal form, even after the annihilation of the material creation. The form of the Lord, as seen by Brahm&#257;, existed before the creation of Brahm&#257;, and the material manifestation with all the ingredients and agents of material creation are also energetic expansions of the Lord, and after the exhibition of the Lord's energy comes to a close, what remains is the same Personality of Godhead. Therefore the form of the Lord exists in all circumstances of creation, maintenance and annihilation. The Vedic hymns confirm this fact in the statement <span class="Italic">v&#257;sudevo v&#257; idam agra &#257;s&#299;n na brahm&#257; na ca &#347;a&#7749;kara eko n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a &#257;s&#299;n na brahm&#257; ne&#347;&#257;na,</span> etc. Before the creation there was none except V&#257;sudeva. There was neither Brahm&#257; nor &#346;a&#7749;kara. Only N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a was there and no one else, neither Brahm&#257; nor &#298;&#347;&#257;na. &#346;r&#299;p&#257;da &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya also confirms in his comments on the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> that N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, or the Personality of Godhead, is transcendental to all creation, but that the whole creation is the product of <span class="Italic">avyakta.</span> Therefore the difference between the created and the creator is always there, although both the creator and created are of the same quality.</div><A NAME="27428"></A><div class="Purport">The other feature of the statement is that the supreme truth is Bhagav&#257;n, or the Personality of Godhead. The Personality of Godhead and His kingdom have already been explained. The kingdom of Godhead is not void as conceived by the impersonalists. The Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets are full of transcendental variegatedness, including the four-handed residents of those planets, with great opulence of wealth and prosperity, and there are even airplanes and other amenities required for high-grade personalities. Therefore the Personality of Godhead exists before the creation, and He exists with all transcendental variegatedness in the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;halokas. The Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;halokas, also accepted in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as being of the <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana</span> nature, are not annihilated even after the annihilation of the manifested cosmos. Those transcendental planets are of a different nature altogether, and that nature is not subjected to the rules and regulations of material creation, maintenance or annihilation. The existence of the Personality of Godhead implies the existence of the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;halokas, as the existence of a king implies the existence of a kingdom.</div><A NAME="27429"></A><div class="Purport">In various places in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> and in other revealed scriptures the existence of the Personality of Godhead is mentioned.

The same confirmation is also in the <span class="Italic">K&#257;&#347;&#299;-kha&#7751;&#7693;a</span> of the <span class="Italic">Skanda Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> in connection with <span class="Italic">dhruva-carita.</span> It is said there:</div><A NAME="27435"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">na cyavante 'pi yad-bhakt&#257;<br>mahaty&#257;&#7745; pralay&#257;padi<br>ato 'cyuto 'khile loke<br>sa eka&#7717; sarvago 'vyaya&#7717;</div></div><A NAME="27436"></A><div class="After-Verse">Even the devotees of the Personality of Godhead are not annihilated during the period of the entire annihilation of the material world, not to speak of the Lord Himself.

The activities of Brahm&#257; and other demigods during the maintenance of the creation are to be understood as the activities of the Lord. The king, or the head executive of a state, may not be seen in the government offices, for he may be engaged in royal comforts. Yet it should be understood that everything is being done under his direction and everything is at his command. The Personality of Godhead is never formless. In the material world He may not be visible in His personal form to the less intelligent class of men, and therefore He may sometimes be called formless. But actually He is always in His eternal form in His Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets as well as in other planets of the universes as different incarnations. The example of the sun is very appropriate in this connection. The sun in the night may not be visible to the eyes of men in the darkness, but the sun is visible wherever it has risen. That the sun is not visible to the eyes of the inhabitants of a particular part of the earth does not mean that the sun has no form.</div><A NAME="27438"></A><div class="Purport">In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>B&#7771;had-&#257;ra&#7751;yaka Upani&#7779;ad</span></B> (1.4.1) there is the hymn <span class="Italic">&#257;tmaivedam agra &#257;s&#299;t puru&#7779;a-vidha&#7717;.</span> This <span class="Italic">mantra</span> indicates the Supreme Personality of Godhead (K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a) even before the appearance of the <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a</span> incarnation. In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index8146.html?g=4985">15.18</a>) it is said that Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is Puru&#7779;ottama because He is the supreme <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a,</span> transcendental even to the <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a-ak&#7779;ara</span> and the <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a-k&#7779;ara.</span> The <span class="Italic">ak&#7779;ara-puru&#7779;a,</span> or the Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, throws His glance over <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti,</span> or material nature, but the Puru&#7779;ottama existed even before that. The <span class="Italic">B&#7771;had-&#257;ra&#7751;yaka Upani&#7779;ad</span> therefore confirms the statement of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> that Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the Supreme Person (Puru&#7779;ottama).</div><A NAME="27439"></A><div class="Purport">In some of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> it is also said that in the beginning only the impersonal Brahman existed. However, according to this verse, the impersonal Brahman, which is the glowing effulgence of the body of the Supreme Lord, may be called the immediate cause, but the cause of all causes, or the remote cause, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord's impersonal feature is existent in the material world because by material senses or material eyes the Lord cannot be seen or perceived. One has to spiritualize the senses before one can expect to see or perceive the Supreme Lord. But He is always engaged in His personal capacity, and He is eternally visible to the inhabitants of Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka, eye to eye. Therefore He is materially impersonal, just as the executive head of the state may be impersonal in the government offices, although he is not impersonal in the government house. Similarly, the Lord is not impersonal in His abode, which is always <span class="Italic">nirasta-kuhakam,</span> as stated in the very beginning of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> Therefore both the impersonal and personal features of the Lord are acceptable, as mentioned in the revealed scriptures. This Personality of Godhead is very emphatically explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> in connection with the verse <span class="Italic">brahma&#7751;o hi prati&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;ham</span> (Bg. <a href="index3746.html?g=4826">14.27</a>). Therefore in all ways the confidential part of spiritual knowledge is realization of the Personality of Godhead, and not His impersonal Brahman feature. One should therefore have his ultimate aim of realization not in the impersonal feature but in the personal feature of the Absolute Truth. The example of the sky within the pot and the sky outside the pot may be helpful to the student for his realization of the all-pervading quality of the cosmic consciousness of the Absolute Truth. But that does not mean that the individual part and parcel of the Lord becomes the Supreme by a false claim. It means only that the conditioned soul is a victim of the illusory energy in her last snare. To claim to be one with the cosmic consciousness of the Lord is the last trap set by the illusory energy, or <span class="Italic">daiv&#299; m&#257;y&#257;.</span> Even in the impersonal existence of the Lord, as it is in the material creation, one should aspire for personal realization of the Lord, and that is the meaning of <span class="Italic">pa&#347;c&#257;d aha&#7745; yad etac ca yo 'va&#347;i&#7779;yeta so 'smy aham.</span></div><A NAME="27440"></A><div class="Purport">Brahm&#257;j&#299; also accepted the same truth when he was instructing N&#257;rada.

This very confidential instruction to the pure devotees of the Lord was also given to Arjuna and to Brahm&#257; in the beginning of the creation. The demigods like Brahm&#257;, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, Mahe&#347;vara, Indra, Candra and Varu&#7751;a are undoubtedly different forms of the Lord for execution of different functions; the different elemental ingredients of material creation, as well as the multifarious energies, also may be of the same Personality of Godhead, but the root of all of them is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. One should be attached to the root of everything rather than bewildered by the branches and leaves. That is the instruction given in this verse.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

And as such, whenever there is forgetfulness of this prime relation with the Lord, and whenever things are accepted as real without being related to the Lord, that conception is called a product of the illusory energy of the Lord. Because nothing can exist without the Lord, it should be known that the illusory energy is also an energy of the Lord. The right conclusion of dovetailing everything in relationship with the Lord is called <span class="Italic">yoga-m&#257;y&#257;,</span> or the energy of union, and the wrong conception of detaching a thing from its relationship with the Lord is called the Lord's <span class="Italic">daiv&#299; m&#257;y&#257;,</span> or <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-m&#257;y&#257;.</span> Both the <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;s</span> also have connections with the Lord because nothing can exist without being related to Him. As such, the wrong conception of detaching relationships from the Lord is not false but illusory.</div><A NAME="27458"></A><div class="Purport">Misconceiving one thing for another thing is called illusion. For example, accepting a rope as a snake is illusion, but the rope is not false. The rope, as it exists in the front of the illusioned person, is not at all false, but the acceptance is illusory. Therefore the wrong conception of accepting this material manifestation as being divorced from the energy of the Lord is illusion, but it is not false. And this illusory conception is called the reflection of the reality in the darkness of ignorance. Anything that appears as apparently not being "produced out of My energy" is called <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> The conception that the living entity is formless or that the Supreme Lord is formless is also illusion. In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index6a29.html?g=493">2.12</a>) it was said by the Lord in the midst of the battlefield that the warriors standing in front of Arjuna, Arjuna himself, and even the Lord had all existed before, they were existing on the Battlefield of Kuruk&#7779;etra, and they would all continue to be individual personalities in the future also, even after the annihilation of the present body and even after being liberated from the bondage of material existence. In all circumstances, the Lord and the living entities are individual personalities, and the personal features of both the Lord and living beings are never abolished; only the influence of the illusory energy, the reflection of light in the darkness, can, by the mercy of the Lord, be removed. In the material world, the light of the sun is also not independent, nor is that of the moon. The real source of light is the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti,</span> which diffuses light from the transcendental body of the Lord, and the same light is reflected in varieties of light: the light of the sun, the light of the moon, the light of fire, or the light of electricity. So the identity of the self as being unconnected with the Supreme Self, the Lord, is also illusion, and the false claim "<span class="Italic">I am the Supreme</span>" is the last illusory snare of the same <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> or the external energy of the Lord.</div><A NAME="27459"></A><div class="Purport">The <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra</span> in the very beginning affirms that everything is born from the Supreme, and thus, as explained in the previous verse, all individual living entities are born from the energy of the supreme living being, the Personality of Godhead. Brahm&#257; himself was born from the energy of the Lord, and all other living entities are born from the energy of the Lord through the agency of Brahm&#257;; none of them has any existence without being dovetailed with the Supreme Lord.</div><A NAME="27460"></A><div class="Purport">The independence of the individual living entity is not real independence, but is just the reflection of the real independence existing in the Supreme Being, the Lord. The false claim of supreme independence by the conditioned souls is illusion, and this conclusion is admitted in this verse.</div><A NAME="27461"></A><div class="Purport">Persons with a poor fund of knowledge become illusioned, and therefore the so-called scientists, physiologists, empiric philosophers, etc., become dazzled by the glaring reflection of the sun, moon, electricity, etc., and deny the existence of the Supreme Lord, putting forward theories and different speculations about the creation, maintenance and annihilation of everything material. The medical practitioner may deny the existence of the soul in the physiological bodily construction of an individual person, but he cannot give life to a dead body, even though all the mechanisms of the body exist even after death. The psychologist makes a serious study of the physiological conditions of the brain, as if the construction of the cerebral lump were the machine of the functioning mind, but in the dead body the psychologist cannot bring back the function of the mind. These scientific studies of the cosmic manifestation or the bodily construction independent of the Supreme Lord are different reflective intellectual gymnastics only, but at the end they are all illusion and nothing more. All such advancement of science and knowledge in the present context of material civilization is but an action of the covering influence of the illusory energy. The illusory energy has two phases of existence, namely the covering influence and the throwing influence. By the throwing influence the illusory energy throws the living entities into the darkness of ignorance, and by the covering influence she covers the eyes of men with a poor fund of knowledge about the existence of the Supreme Person who enlightened the supreme individual living being, Brahm&#257;. The identity of Brahm&#257; with the Supreme Lord is never claimed herein, and therefore such a foolish claim by the man with a poor fund of knowledge is another display of the illusory energy of the Lord. The Lord says in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index22da.html?g=5141">16.18</a>-20) that demoniac persons who deny the existence of the Lord are thrown more and more into the darkness of ignorance, and thus such demoniac persons transmigrate life after life without any knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div><A NAME="27462"></A><div class="Purport">The sane man, however, is enlightened in the disciplic succession from Brahm&#257;j&#299;, who was personally instructed by the Lord, or in the disciplic succession from Arjuna, who was personally instructed by the Lord in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> He accepts this statement of the Lord:</div><A NAME="27463"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">aha&#7745; sarvasya prabhavo<br>matta&#7717; sarva&#7745; pravartate<br>iti matv&#257; bhajante m&#257;&#7745;<br>budh&#257; bh&#257;va-samanvit&#257;&#7717;</div></div><A NAME="27464"></A><div class="VerseRef">(Bg. <a href="index58fa.html?g=3360">10.8</a>)</div><A NAME="27465"></A><div class="After-Verse">The Lord is the original source of all emanations, and everything that is created, maintained and annihilated exists by the energy of the Lord.

In the medical science of the ancient sages, known as the <span class="Italic">&#256;yur-veda,</span> there is definite acceptance of the Lord s supremacy in the following words:</div><A NAME="27467"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">jagad-yoner anicchasya<br>cid-&#257;nandaika-r&#363;pi&#7751;a&#7717;<br>pu&#7745;so 'sti prak&#7771;tir nity&#257;<br>praticch&#257;yeva bh&#257;svata&#7717;</div></div><A NAME="27468"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">acetan&#257;pi caitanya-<br>yogena param&#257;tmana&#7717;<br>akarod vi&#347;vam akhilam<br>anityam n&#257;&#7789;ak&#257;k&#7771;tim</div></div><A NAME="27469"></A><div class="After-Verse">There is one Supreme Person who is the progenitor of this cosmic manifestation and whose energy acts as <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti,</span> or the material nature, dazzling like a reflection. By such illusory action of <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti,</span> even dead matter is caused to move by the cooperation of living energy of the Lord, and the material world appears like a dramatic performance to the ignorant eyes. The ignorant person, therefore, may even be a scientist or physiologist in the drama of <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti,</span> while the sane person knows <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti</span> as the illusory energy of the Lord. By such a conclusion, as confirmed by the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> it is clear that the living entities are also a display of the Lord's superior energy (<span class="Italic">par&#257; prak&#7771;ti</span>), just as the material world is a display of the Lord's inferior energy (<span class="Italic">apar&#257; prak&#7771;ti</span>). The superior energy of the Lord cannot be as good as the Lord, although there is very little difference between the energy and the possessor of the energy, or the fire and the heat. Fire is possessed of heat, but heat is not fire. This simple thing is not understood by the man with a poor fund of knowledge who falsely claims that the fire and heat are the same. This energy of the fire (namely heat) is explained here as a reflection, and not directly fire. Therefore the living energy represented by the living entities is the reflection of the Lord, and never the Lord Himself. Being the reflection of the Lord, the existence of the living entity is dependent on the Supreme Lord, who is the original light. This material energy may be compared to darkness, as actually it is darkness, and the activities of the living entities in the darkness are reflections of the original light. The Lord should be understood by the context of this verse. Nondependence of both the energies of the Lord is explained as <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> or illusion. No one can make a solution of the darkness of ignorance simply by the reflection of light. <JD:"Destination-497">Similarly, no one can come out of material existence simply by the reflected light of the common man; one has to receive the light from the original light itself. The reflection of sunlight in the darkness is unable to drive out the darkness, but the sunlight outside the reflection can drive out the darkness completely. In darkness no one can see the things in a room. Therefore a person in the dark is afraid of snakes and scorpions, although there may not be such things. But in the light the things in the room can be clearly seen, and the fear of snakes and scorpions is at once removed. Therefore one has to take shelter of the light of the Lord, as in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> or the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> and not the reflective personalities who have no touch with the Lord. No one should hear <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> or <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> from a person who does not believe in the existence of the Lord. Such a person is already doomed, and any association with such a doomed person makes the associater also doomed.</div><A NAME="27470"></A><div class="Purport">According to the <span class="Italic">Padma Pur&#257;&#7751;a,</span> within the material compass there are innumerable material universes, and all of them are full of darkness. Any living being, beginning from the Brahm&#257;s (there are innumerable Brahm&#257;s in innumerable universes) to the insignificant ant, are all born in darkness, and they require factual light from the Lord to see Him directly, just as the sun can be seen only by the direct light of the sun. No lamp or man-made torchlight, however powerful it may be, can help one see the sun. The sun reveals itself. Therefore the action of different energies of the Lord, or the Personality of Godhead Himself, can be realized by the light manifested by the causeless mercy of the Lord. The impersonalists say that God cannot be seen. God can be seen by the light of God and not by man-made speculations. Here this light is specifically mentioned as <span class="Italic">vidy&#257;t,</span> which is an order by the Lord to Brahm&#257;. This direct order of the Lord is a manifestation of His internal energy, and this particular energy is the means of seeing the Lord face to face. Not only Brahm&#257; but anyone who may be graced by the Lord to see such merciful direct internal energy can also realize the Personality of Godhead without any mental speculation.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

In the developed stage of consciousness, the human being can study both physiological and physical science, but the basic principles of such sciences are nothing but the material elements and nothing more. The body of the human being and the body of the mountain, as also the bodies of the demigods, including Brahm&#257;, are all of the same ingredients-earth, water, etc.-and at the same time the elements are beyond the body. The elements were created first, and therefore they entered into the bodily construction later, but in both circumstances they entered the cosmos and also did not enter. Similarly, the Supreme Lord, by His different energies, namely the internal and external, is within everything in the manifested cosmos, and at the same time He is outside of everything, situated in the kingdom of God (Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka) as described before.

Herein lies the mystery of His transcendental knowledge. This mystery is transcendental love of Godhead, and one who is surcharged with such transcendental love of Godhead can without difficulty see the Personality of Godhead in every atom and every movable or immovable object. And at the same time he can see the Personality of Godhead in His own abode, Goloka, enjoying eternal pastimes with His eternal associates, who are also expansions of His transcendental existence. This vision is the real mystery of spiritual knowledge, as stated by the Lord in the beginning (<span class="Italic">sarahasya&#7745; tad-a&#7749;ga&#7745; ca</span>). This mystery is the most confidential part of the knowledge of the Supreme, and it is impossible for the mental speculators to discover by dint of intellectual gymnastics. The mystery can be revealed through the process recommended by Brahm&#257;j&#299; in his <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span></B> (5.38) as follows:</div><A NAME="27491"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">prem&#257;&ntilde;jana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena<br>santa&#7717; sadaiva h&#7771;daye&#7779;u vilokayanti<br>ya&#7745; &#347;y&#257;masundaram acintya-gu&#7751;a-svar&#363;pa&#7745;<br>govindam &#257;di-puru&#7779;a&#7745; tam aha&#7745; bhaj&#257;mi</div></div><A NAME="27492"></A><div class="After-Verse"><JD:"Destination-498">"I worship the original Personality of Godhead, Govinda, whom the pure devotees, their eyes smeared with the ointment of love of Godhead, always observe within their hearts. This Govinda, the original Personality of Godhead, is &#346;y&#257;masundara with all transcendental qualities."</div><A NAME="27493"></A><div class="Purport">Therefore, although He is present in every atom, the Supreme Personality of Godhead may not be visible to the dry speculators; still the mystery is unfolded before the eyes of the pure devotees because their eyes are anointed with love of Godhead. And this love of Godhead can be attained only by the practice of transcendental loving service of the Lord, and nothing else. The vision of the devotees is not ordinary; it is purified by the process of devotional service. In other words, as the universal elements are both within and without, similarly the Lord's name, form, quality, pastimes, entourage, etc., as they are described in the revealed scriptures or as performed in the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;halokas, far, far beyond the material cosmic manifestation, are factually being televised in the heart of the devotee. The man with a poor fund of knowledge cannot understand, although by material science one can see things far away by means of television. Factually, the spiritually developed person is able to have the television of the kingdom of God always reflected within his heart. That is the mystery of knowledge of the Personality of Godhead.</div><A NAME="27494"></A><div class="Purport">The Lord can award anyone and everyone liberation (<span class="Italic">mukti</span>) from the bondage of material existence, yet He rarely awards the privilege of love of Godhead, as confirmed by N&#257;rada (<span class="Italic">mukti&#7745; dadh&#257;ti karhicit sma na bhakti-yogam</span>). This transcendental devotional service of the Lord is so wonderful that the occupation keeps the deserving devotee always rapt in psychological activities, without deviation from the absolute touch. Thus love of Godhead, developed in the heart of the devotee, is a great mystery. Brahm&#257;j&#299; previously told N&#257;rada that the desires of Brahm&#257;j&#299; are never unfulfilled because he is always absorbed in the transcendental loving service of the Lord; nor has he any desire in his heart save and except the transcendental service of the Lord. That is the beauty and mystery of the process of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> As the Lord's desire is infallible because He is <span class="Italic">acyuta,</span> similarly the desires of the devotees in the transcendental service of the Lord are also <span class="Italic">acyuta,</span> infallible. This is very difficult, however, for the layman to understand without knowledge of the mystery of devotional service, as it is very difficult to know the potency of touchstone. As touchstone is rarely found, a pure devotee of the Lord is also rarely to be seen, even amongst millions of liberated souls (<span class="Italic">ko&#7789;i&#7779;v api mah&#257;mune</span>). Out of all kinds of perfections attained by the process of knowledge, <span class="Italic">yoga</span> perfection in devotional service is the highest of all and the most mysterious also, even more mysterious than the eight kinds of mystic perfection attained by the process of yogic performances. In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexc83c.html?g=5979">18.64</a>) the Lord therefore advised Arjuna about this <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga:</span></div><A NAME="27495"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">sarva-guhyatama&#7745; bh&#363;ya&#7717;<br>&#347;&#7771;&#7751;u me parama&#7745; vaca&#7717;</div></div><A NAME="27496"></A><div class="After-Verse">"Just hear from Me again about the most confidential part of the instructions in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span>" The same was confirmed by Brahm&#257;j&#299; to N&#257;rada in the following words:</div><A NAME="27497"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">ida&#7745; bh&#257;gavata&#7745; n&#257;ma<br>yan me bhagavatoditam<br>sa&#7749;graho 'ya&#7745; vibh&#363;t&#299;n&#257;&#7745;<br>tvam etad vipul&#299;kuru</div></div><A NAME="27498"></A><div class="After-Verse">Brahm&#257;j&#299; said to N&#257;rada, "Whatever I have spoken to you about the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> was explained to me by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and I am advising you to expand these topics nicely so that people may easily understand the mysterious <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> by transcendental loving service to the Lord." It is to be noted here that the mystery of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> was disclosed to Brahm&#257;j&#299; by the Lord Himself.

Everyone is searching after self-realization in different ways-by <span class="Italic">karma-yoga,</span> by <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na-yoga,</span> by <span class="Italic">dhy&#257;na-yoga,</span> by <span class="Italic">r&#257;ja-yoga,</span> by <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> etc. To engage in self-realization is the responsibility of every living entity developed in consciousness. One who is developed in consciousness certainly makes inquiries into the mystery of the self, of the cosmic situation and of the problems of life, in all spheres and fields-social, political, economic, cultural, religious, moral, etc.-and in their different branches. But here the goal of all such inquiries is explained.</div><A NAME="27513"></A><div class="Purport">The <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra</span> philosophy begins with this inquiry about life, and the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> answers such inquiries up to this point, or the mystery of all inquiries. Lord Brahm&#257; wanted to be perfectly educated by the Personality of Godhead, and here is the answer by the Lord, finished in four nutshell verses, from <span class="Italic">aham eva</span> to this verse, <span class="Italic">et&#257;vad eva.</span> This is the end of all self-realization processes. Men do not know that the ultimate goal of life is Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, due to being bewildered by the glaring reflection in the darkness, and as such everyone is entering into the darkest region of material existence, driven by the uncontrolled senses. The whole material existence has sprung up because of sense gratification, desires based principally on the sex desire, and the result is that in spite of all advancement of knowledge, the final goal of all the activities of the living entities is sense gratification. But here is the real goal of life, and everyone should know it by inquiries put before a bona fide spiritual master expert in the science of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> or from a living personality of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> life. Everyone is engaged in various kinds of scriptural inquiries, but the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> gives answers to all of the various students of self-realization: this ultimate objective of life is not to be searched out without great labor or perseverance. One who is imbued with such sincere inquiries must ask the bona fide spiritual master in the disciplic succession from Brahm&#257;j&#299;, and that is the direction given here. Because the mystery was disclosed before Brahm&#257;j&#299; by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the mystery of all such inquiries regarding self-realization must be put before such a spiritual master, who is directly the representative of the Lord, acknowledged in that disciplic succession. Such a bona fide spiritual master is able to clear up the whole thing by evidence from the revealed scriptures, both direct and indirect. Although everyone is free to consult the revealed scriptures in this connection, one still requires the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, and that is the direction in this verse. The bona fide spiritual master is the most confidential representative of the Lord, and one must receive direction from the spiritual master in the same spirit that Brahm&#257;j&#299; received it from the Personality of Godhead, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The bona fide spiritual master in that bona fide chain of disciplic succession never claims to be the Lord Himself, although such a spiritual master is greater than the Lord in the sense that he can deliver the Lord by his personally realized experience. The Lord is not to be found simply by education or by a good fertile brain, but surely He can be found by the sincere student through the transparent medium of the bona fide spiritual master.</div><A NAME="27514"></A><div class="Purport">The revealed scriptures give directions directly to this end, but because the bewildered living entities are blinded by the glaring reflection in the darkness, they are unable to find the truth of the revealed scriptures.

Undoubtedly the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> is accepted as one of the most brilliant stars in the horizon of the spiritual sky, yet the interpretations of this great book of knowledge have so grossly been distorted that every student of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> is still in the same darkness of glaring material reflections.

Even if they are adopted, there is every chance of discrepancies in discharging the particular type of functions. But adoption of the transcendental devotional service of the Lord has no limit, nor is there fear of falling down. The process automatically reaches the final stage by the grace of the Lord. In the preliminary stage of devotional service there is an apparent requisite for knowledge, but in the higher stage there is no necessity of such knowledge.

There are many grammarians and nondevotee material wranglers who have tried to present false interpretations of these four verses of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> but the Lord Himself advised Brahm&#257;j&#299; not to be deviated from the fixed conclusion the Lord had taught him. The Lord was the teacher of the nucleus of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> in four verses, and Brahm&#257; was the receiver of the knowledge. Misinterpretation of the word <span class="Italic">aham</span> by the word jugglery of the impersonalist should not disturb the mind of the strict followers of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the text of the Personality of Godhead and His unalloyed devotees, who are also known as the <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavatas,</span> and any outsider should have no access to this confidential literature of devotional service. But unfortunately the impersonalist, who has no relation to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, sometimes tries to interpret <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> by his poor fund of knowledge in grammar and dry speculation. Therefore, the Lord warns Brahm&#257; (and, through Brahm&#257;, all future devotees of the Lord in the disciplic succession of Brahm&#257;) that one should never be misled by the conclusion of the so-called grammarians or by other men with a poor fund of knowledge, but must always fix the mind properly, via the <span class="Italic">parampar&#257;</span> system. No one should try to give a new interpretation by dint of mundane knowledge. And the first step, therefore, in pursuance of the system of knowledge received by Brahm&#257;, is to approach a bona fide <span class="Italic">guru</span> who is the representative of the Lord following the <span class="Italic">parampar&#257;</span> system. No one should try to squeeze out his own meaning by imperfect mundane knowledge. The <span class="Italic">guru,</span> or the bona fide spiritual master, is competent to teach the disciple in the right path with reference to the context of all authentic Vedic literature. He does not attempt to juggle words to bewilder the student. The bona fide spiritual master, by his personal activities, teaches the disciple the principles of devotional service. Without personal service, one would go on speculating like the impersonalists and dry speculators life after life and would be unable to reach the final conclusion. By following the instructions of the bona fide spiritual master in conjunction with the principles of revealed scriptures, the student will rise to the plane of complete knowledge, which will be exhibited by development of detachment from the world of sense gratification. The mundane wranglers are surprised that one can detach himself from the world of sense gratification, and thus any attempt to be fixed in God realization appears to them to be mysticism. This detachment from the sensory world is called the <span class="Italic">brahma-bh&#363;ta </I>[</I>SB <a href="index2486.html?g=41459">4.30.20</a></I>]</span></I> stage of realization, the preliminary stage of transcendental devotional life (<span class="Italic">par&#257; bhakti&#7717;</span>).

Therefore the whole process of God consciousness is meant to rectify the conditional activities of the senses and to re-engage them in the direct service of the Lord. Lord Brahm&#257; thus engaged his senses in the Lord by re-creating the conditioned living entities to act in the re-created universe. This material universe is thus created and annihilated by the will of the Lord. It is created to give the conditioned soul a chance to act to return home, back to Godhead, and servants like Brahm&#257;j&#299;, N&#257;radaj&#299;, Vy&#257;saj&#299; and their company become busy with the same purpose of the Lord: to reclaim the conditioned souls from the field of sense gratification and return them to the normal stage of engaging the senses in service of the Lord. Instead of doing so, i.e. converting the actions of the senses, the impersonalists began to make the conditioned souls sense-less, and the Lord also senseless. That is improper treatment for the conditioned souls. The diseased condition of the senses may be treated by curing the defect, but not uprooting the senses altogether. When there is some disease in the eyes, the eyes may be cured to see properly. Plucking out the eyes is no treatment. Similarly, the whole material disease is based on the process of sense gratification, and liberation from the diseased condition is re-engagement of the senses to see the beauty of the Lord, hear His glories, and act on His account. Thus Brahm&#257;j&#299; created the universal activities again.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

As Brahm&#257;j&#299; received the knowledge directly from the Lord by satisfying Him fully, similarly one has to receive the transcendental knowledge from the spiritual master by satisfying him. The spiritual master's satisfaction is the means of assimilating transcendental knowledge. One cannot understand transcendental knowledge simply by becoming a grammarian.

Such relationship between the disciple and the spiritual master is eternal. One who is now the disciple is the next spiritual master. And one cannot be a bona fide and authorized spiritual master unless one has been strictly obedient to his spiritual master. Brahm&#257;j&#299;, as a disciple of the Supreme Lord, received the real knowledge and imparted it to his dear disciple N&#257;rada, and similarly N&#257;rada, as spiritual master, handed over this knowledge to Vy&#257;sa and so on. Therefore the so-called formal spiritual master and disciple are not facsimiles of Brahm&#257; and N&#257;rada or N&#257;rada and Vy&#257;sa. The relationship between Brahm&#257; and N&#257;rada is reality, while the so-called formality is the relation between the cheater and cheated. It is clearly mentioned herewith that N&#257;rada is not only well behaved, meek and obedient, but also self-controlled. One who is not self-controlled, specifically in sex life, can become neither a disciple nor a spiritual master. One must have disciplinary training in controlling speaking, anger, the tongue, the mind, the belly and the genitals. One who has controlled the particular senses mentioned above is called a <span class="Italic">gosv&#257;m&#299;.</span> Without becoming a <span class="Italic">gosv&#257;m&#299;</span> one can become neither a disciple nor a spiritual master. The so-called spiritual master without sense control is certainly the cheater, and the disciple of such a so-called spiritual master is the cheated.</div><A NAME="27696"></A><div class="Purport">One should not think of Brahm&#257;j&#299; as a dead great-grandfather, as we have experience on this planet. He is the oldest great-grandfather, and he is still living, and N&#257;rada is also living. The age of the inhabitants of the Brahmaloka planet is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> The inhabitants of this small planet earth can hardly calculate even the duration of one day of Brahm&#257;.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

In the four verses it is first said that the Lord existed before the creation, and thus the beginning of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> includes the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta</span> aphorism <span class="Italic">janm&#257;dy asya</I> [SB </I><a href="index4dab.html?g=6120">1.1.1</a></I>]</I>.</span> <span class="Italic">Janm&#257;dy asya</span> is the beginning, yet the four verses in which it is said that the Lord is the root of everything that be, beginning from the creation up to the supreme abode of the Lord, naturally explain the ten characteristics. One should not misunderstand by wrong interpretations that the Lord spoke only four verses and that therefore all the rest of the 17,994 verses are useless. The ten characteristics, as will be explained in the next chapter, require so many verses just to explain them properly. Brahm&#257;j&#299; had also advised N&#257;rada previously that he should expand the idea he had heard from Brahm&#257;j&#299;. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu instructed this to &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; in a nutshell, but the disciple R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; expanded this very elaborately, and the same subject was further expanded by J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; and even further by &#346;r&#299; Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura. We are just trying to follow in the footsteps of all these authorities. So <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is not like ordinary fiction or mundane literature. It is unlimited in strength, and however one may expand it according to one's own ability, <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> still cannot be finished by such expansion. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> being the sound representation of the Lord, is simultaneously explained in four verses and in four billion verses all the same, inasmuch as the Lord is smaller than the atom and bigger than the unlimited sky. Such is the potency of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span></div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

But because the devotees are <span class="Italic">bhakti-yog&#299;s,</span> they do not undertake the trouble to meditate upon the impersonal Brahman; as indicated here, they meditate on <span class="Italic">brahma paramam,</span> or the Supreme Brahman. Brahman realization begins from the impersonal effulgence, but by further progress of such meditation, manifestation of the Supreme Soul, Param&#257;tm&#257; realization, takes place. And progressing further, realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is fixed. &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada Muni, as the spiritual master of Vy&#257;sadeva, knew very well the position of Vy&#257;sadeva, and thus he certified the qualities of &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva as fixed in the Absolute Truth with great vow, etc. N&#257;rada advised meditation upon the transcendental activities of the Lord. Impersonal Brahman has no activities, but the Personality of Godhead has many activities, and all such activities are transcendental, without any tinge of material quality.

The Vedic conclusion is transcendental light, whereas the non-Vedic conclusion is material darkness.

The ingredients for creation and the subordinate creator, Brahm&#257;, are first created by Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u in His first and second incarnations. The first <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a</span> incarnation is Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and the second <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a</span> incarnation is the Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, from whom Brahm&#257; is created. The third <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a avat&#257;ra</span> is the K&#7779;&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, who lives as the Supersoul of everything in the universe and maintains the creation generated by Brahm&#257;. &#346;iva is one of the many sons of Brahm&#257;, and he annihilates the creation. Therefore the original creator of the universe is Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and He is also the maintainer of the created beings by His causeless mercy. As such, it is the duty of all conditioned souls to acknowledge the victory of the Lord and thus become pure devotees and live peacefully in this world, where miseries and dangers are always in existence. The conditioned souls, who take this material creation as the place for satisfaction of the senses and thus are illusioned by the external energy of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, remain again to be subjected to the laws of material nature, creation and destruction.</div><A NAME="27808"></A><div class="Purport">In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is said that beginning from the topmost planet of this universe down to the lowest planet, P&#257;t&#257;laloka, all are destructible, and the conditioned souls may travel in space either by good or bad work or by modern spacecraft, but they are sure to die everywhere, although the duration of life in different planets is different. The only means to attain eternal life is to go back home, back to Godhead, where there is no more rebirth as in the material planets. The conditioned souls, being unaware of this very simple fact because of forgetting their relationship with the Lord of Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha, try to plan out a permanent life in this material world. Being illusioned by the external energy, they thus become engaged in various types of economic and religious development, forgetting that they are meant for going back home, back to Godhead. This forgetfulness is so strong due to the influence of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> that the conditioned souls do not at all want to go back to Godhead. By sense enjoyment they become victims of birth and death repeatedly and thus spoil human lives which are chances for going back to Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. The directive scriptures made by the Manus in different ages and millenniums are called <span class="Italic">sad-dharma,</span> good guidance for the human beings, who should take advantage of all the revealed scriptures for their own interest, to make life's successful termination. The creation is not false, but it is a temporary manifestation just to give a chance for the conditioned souls to go back to Godhead. The desire to go back to Godhead and functions performed in that direction form the right path of work. When such a regulative path is accepted, the Lord gives all protection to His devotees by His causeless mercy, while the nondevotees risk their own activities to bind themselves in a chain of fruitive reactions. The word <span class="Italic">sad-dharma</span> is significant in this connection. <span class="Italic">Sad-dharma,</span> or duty performed for going back to Godhead and thus becoming His unalloyed devotee, is the only pious activity; all others may pretend to be pious, but actually they are not. It is for this reason only that the Lord advises in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> that one give up all so-called religious activities and completely engage in the devotional service of the Lord to become free from all anxieties due to the dangerous life of material existence. To work situated in <span class="Italic">sad-dharma</span> is the right direction of life. One's aim of life should be to go back home, back to Godhead, and not be subjected to repeated births and deaths in the material world by getting good or bad bodies for temporary existence. Herein lies the intelligence of human life, and one should desire the activities of life in that way.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The merciful Lord, out of His causeless mercy, descends to various planets in the material world and acts for the salvation of the conditioned souls.

Most of them are ever liberated, or <span class="Italic">nitya-muktas,</span> while some of them are ever conditioned. The ever-conditioned souls are apt to develop a mentality of lording over the material nature, and therefore the material cosmic creation is manifested to give the ever-conditioned souls two kinds of facilities. One facility is that the conditioned soul can act according to his tendency to lord it over the cosmic manifestation, and the other facility gives the conditioned soul a chance to come back to Godhead. So after the winding up of the cosmic manifestation, most of the conditioned souls merge into the existence of the Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u Personality of Godhead, lying in His mystic slumber, to be created again in the next creation. But some of the conditioned souls, who follow the transcendental sound in the form of Vedic literatures and are thus able to go back to Godhead, attain spiritual and original bodies after quitting the conditional gross and subtle material bodies. The material conditional bodies develop out of the living entities' forgetfulness of their relationship with Godhead, and during the course of the cosmic manifestation, the conditioned souls are given a chance to revive their original status of life with the help of revealed scriptures, so mercifully compiled by the Lord in His different incarnations. Reading or hearing of such transcendental literatures helps one become liberated even in the conditional state of material existence. All the Vedic literatures aim at devotional service to the Personality of Godhead, and as soon as one is fixed upon this point, he at once becomes liberated from conditional life. The material gross and subtle forms are simply due to the conditioned soul's ignorance and as soon as he is fixed in the devotional service of the Lord, he becomes eligible to be freed from the conditioned state. This devotional service is transcendental attraction for the Supreme on account of His being the source of all pleasing humors.

In the First Canto of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> this truth is indicated in the questions and answers by S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; and great sages like &#346;aunaka, and in the First and Second Chapters of the canto this is explained.

But still apparently there are divisions of the controller and controlled. For example, in the food-controlling department the controller of food is a person made of the same ingredients as the person who is controlled. Similarly, each and every individual in the material world is controlled by the higher demigods. For example, we have our senses, but the senses are controlled by superior controlling deities. We cannot see without light, and the supreme controller of light is the sun. The sun-god is in the sun planet, and we, the individual human beings or any other being on this earth, are all controlled by the sun-god as far as our eyes are concerned. Similarly, all the senses we have are controlled by the superior demigods, who are also as much living entities as we are, but one is empowered while the other is controlled. The controlled living entity is called the adhy&#257;tmic person, and the controller is called the adhidaivic person. All these positions in the material world are due to different fruitive activities. Any individual living being can become the sun-god or even Brahm&#257; or any other god in the upper planetary system by a higher grade of pious work, and similarly one becomes controlled by the higher demigods by lower grades of fruitive activities. So every individual living entity is subject to the supreme control of the Param&#257;tm&#257;, who puts everyone in different positions of the controller and the controlled.</div><A NAME="27870"></A><div class="Purport">That which distinguishes the controller and controlled, i.e. the material body, is called the adhibhautic <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a.</span> The body is sometimes called <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a,</span> as confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> in the following hymn: <span class="Italic">sa v&#257; e&#7779;a puru&#7779;o 'nna-rasamaya&#7717;.</span> This body is called the <span class="Italic">anna-rasa</span> embodiment. This body depends on food. The living entity which <span class="Italic">is</span> embodied does not eat anything, however, because the owner is spirit in essence. The material body requires replacement of matter for the wearing and tearing of the mechanical body. Therefore the distinction between the individual living entity and controlling planetary deities is in the <span class="Italic">anna-rasamaya</span> body. The sun may have a gigantic body, and the man may have a smaller body, but all these visible bodies are made of matter; nonetheless, the sun-god and the individual person, who are related as the controller and the controlled, are the same spiritual parts and parcels of the Supreme Being, and it is the Supreme Being who places different parts and parcels in different positions. And thus the conclusion is that the Supreme Person is the shelter of all.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

In the absence of one, another is not understood. But the Supreme Being who sees every one of them as the shelter of the shelter is independent of all, and therefore He is the supreme shelter.</div><A NAME="27883"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="27884"></A><div class="First">There are innumerable living entities, one dependent on the other in the relationship of the controlled and the controller. But without the medium of perception, no one can know or understand who is the controlled and who is the controller. For example, the sun controls the power of our vision, we can see the sun because the sun has its body, and the sunlight is useful only because we have eyes. Without our having eyes, the sunlight is useless, and without sunlight the eyes are useless. Thus they are interdependent, and none of them is independent. Therefore the natural question arises concerning who made them interdependent. The one who has made such a relationship of interdependence must be ultimately completely independent. As stated in the beginning of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> the ultimate source of all interdependent objectives is the complete independent subject. This ultimate source of all interdependence is the Supreme Truth or Param&#257;tm&#257;, the Supersoul, who is not dependent on anything else. He is <span class="Italic">sv&#257;&#347;ray&#257;&#347;raya&#7717;.</span> He is only dependent on His self, and thus He is the supreme shelter of everything. Although Param&#257;tm&#257; and Brahman are subordinate to Bhagav&#257;n, because Bhagav&#257;n is Puru&#7779;ottama or the Superperson, He is the source of the Supersoul also. In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index8146.html?g=4985">15.18</a>) Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says that He is the Puru&#7779;ottama and the source of everything, and thus it is concluded that &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the ultimate source and shelter of all entities, including the Supersoul and Supreme Brahman. Even accepting that there is no difference between the Supersoul and the individual soul, the individual soul is dependent on the Supersoul for being liberated from the illusion of material energy. The individual is under the clutches of illusory energy, and therefore although qualitatively one with the Supersoul, he is under the illusion of identifying himself with matter. And to get out of this illusory conception of factual life, the individual soul has to depend on the Supersoul to be recognized as one with Him. In that sense also the Supersoul is the supreme shelter. And there is no doubt about it.</div><A NAME="27885"></A><div class="Purport">The individual living entity, the <span class="Italic">j&#299;va,</span> is always dependent on the Supersoul, Param&#257;tm&#257;, because the individual soul forgets his spiritual identity whereas the Supersoul, Param&#257;tm&#257;, does not forget His transcendental position. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> these separate positions of the <span class="Italic">j&#299;va-&#257;tm&#257;</span> and the Param&#257;tm&#257; are specifically mentioned.

Some may argue, why not then relish the transcendental <span class="Italic">l&#299;l&#257;</span> of the Lord as exhibited in the land of Mathur&#257; and V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, which are sweeter than anything in the world? &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura replies that the pastimes of the Lord in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana are meant to be relished by advanced devotees of the Lord. Neophyte devotees will misunderstand such supreme transcendental activities of the Lord, and therefore the Lord's pastimes in the material sphere related to creation, maintenance and destruction are verily relishable by the <span class="Italic">pr&#257;k&#7771;ta,</span> or mundane devotees of the Lord. As the <span class="Italic">yoga</span> system mainly based on bodily exercises is meant for the person who is too much attached to the bodily conception of existence, similarly the Lord's pastimes related to the creation and destruction of the material world are for those who are too materially attached. For such mundane creatures the functions of the body and the functions of the cosmic world through physical laws in relationship with the Lord are also therefore included in understanding of the lawmaker, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The scientists explain the material functions by so many technological terms of material law, but such blind scientists forget the lawmaker. The <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> points out the lawmaker. One should not be amazed by the mechanical arrangement of the complicated engine or dynamo, but one should praise the engineer who creates such a wonderful working machine. That is the difference between the devotee and the nondevotee. Devotees are always full with praising the Lord, who directs the physical laws. In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index652d.html?g=3075">9.10</a>) the direction of the Lord upon the material nature is described as follows:</div><A NAME="27903"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">may&#257;dhyak&#7779;e&#7751;a prak&#7771;ti&#7717;<br>s&#363;yate sacar&#257;caram<br>hetun&#257;nena kaunteya<br>jagad viparivartate</div></div><A NAME="27904"></A><div class="After-Verse">"The material nature full of physical laws is one of My different energies; therefore it is neither independent nor blind. Because I am transcendentally all-powerful, simply by My glancing over material nature, the physical laws of nature work so wonderfully. The actions and reactions of the physical laws work on that account, and thus the material world is created, maintained and annihilated again and again."</div><A NAME="27905"></A><div class="Purport">Men with a poor fund of knowledge, however, become astonished by studying the physical laws both within the construction of the individual body and within the cosmic manifestation, and foolishly they decry the existence of God, taking it for granted that the physical laws are independent, without any metaphysical control. The <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexa12b.html?g=3084">9.11</a>) replies to this foolishness in the following words:</div><A NAME="27906"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">avaj&#257;nanti m&#257;&#7745; m&#363;&#7693;h&#257;<br>m&#257;nu&#7779;&#299;&#7745; tanum &#257;&#347;ritam<br>para&#7745; bh&#257;vam aj&#257;nanto<br>mama bh&#363;ta-mahe&#347;varam</div></div><A NAME="27907"></A><div class="After-Verse">"The foolish men <span class="Italic">[m&#363;&#7693;h&#257;&#7717;]</span> do not know the Personality of Godhead in His eternal form of bliss and knowledge." The foolish man thinks of the transcendental body of the Lord as something like his own, and therefore he cannot think of the unlimited controlling power of the Lord, who is not visible in the acting of the physical laws. The Lord is, however, visible to the naked eyes of people in general when He descends Himself by His own personal potency. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a incarnated Himself as He is and played very wonderful parts as the Lord Himself, and the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> concerns such wonderful actions and knowledge. Yet foolish men will not accept Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as the Supreme Lord. Generally they consider the infinitesimal and infinite features of the Lord because they themselves are unable to become either the infinitesimal or the infinite, but one should know that the infinite and infinitesimal sizes of the Lord are not His highest glories. The most wonderful manifestation of the Lord's power is exhibited when the infinite Lord becomes visible to our eyes as one of us. Yet His activities are different from those of the finite beings. Lifting a mountain at the age of seven years and marrying sixteen thousand wives in the prime of His youth are some of the examples of His infinite energy, but the <span class="Italic">m&#363;&#7693;has,</span> after seeing them or hearing about them, decry them as legendary and take the Lord as one of them. They cannot understand that the Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, although in the form of a human being by His own potency, is still the Supreme Lord with full potency as the supreme controller.</div><A NAME="27908"></A><div class="Purport">When, however, the <span class="Italic">m&#363;&#7693;has</span> give submissive and aural reception to the messages of the Lord as in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> or in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> through the channel of disciplic succession, such <span class="Italic">m&#363;&#7693;has</span> also become devotees of the Lord by the grace of His pure devotees.

The enjoyer and the enjoyed both participate in enjoyment, but, deluded by the illusory energy, the living entities want to become the enjoyer like the Lord, although they are not meant for such enjoyment. The <span class="Italic">j&#299;vas,</span> the living entities, are mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as the Lord's superior nature, or <span class="Italic">par&#257; prak&#7771;ti,</span> and so also it is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u Pur&#257;&#7751;a.</span> Therefore the living entities are never the <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;as,</span> or the factual enjoyers. As such, the spirit of enjoyment by the living entity in the material world is false. In the spiritual world the living entities are pure in nature, and therefore they are associates in the enjoyment of the Supreme Lord. In the material world the spirit of enjoyment of the living entities by dint of their own actions (<span class="Italic">karma</span>) gradually fades by the laws of nature, and thus the illusory energy dictates in the ears of the conditioned souls that they should become one with the Lord. This is the last snare of the illusory energy. When the last illusion is also cleared off by the mercy of the Lord, the living entity again becomes reinstated in his original position and thus becomes actually liberated. For this attainment of liberation from the material clutches, the Lord creates the material world, maintains it for some time (one thousand years of His measurement, as stated in the previous verse), and then again annihilates it by His will. The living entities are therefore completely dependent on the mercy of the Lord, and all their so-called enjoyments by scientific improvement are crushed into dust when the Lord desires.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

It is to be understood, therefore, that the activities of the sense organs are controlled by the will of the Supreme. The senses are, so to speak, offering a license for the conditioned souls, who are to use them properly under the control of the controlling deity deputed by the Supreme Lord. One who violates such controlling regulations has to be punished by degradation to a lower status of life. Consider, for example, the tongue and its controlling deity, Varu&#7751;a. The tongue is meant for eating, and men, animals and birds each have their different tastes because of different licenses. The taste of human beings and that of the swine are not on the same level. The controlling deity, however, awards or certifies a particular type of body when the particular living entity develops a taste in terms of different modes of nature. If the human being develops taste without discrimination, as does the swine, then the controlling deity is certainly certified for the next term to award him the body of a swine. The swine accepts any kind of foodstuff, including stools, and a human being who has developed such indiscriminate taste must be prepared for a degraded life in the next life. Such a life is also God's grace because the conditioned soul desired a body like that for perfectly tasting a particular type of foodstuff. If a man gets the body of a swine it must be considered the grace of the Lord because the Lord awards the facility. After death the next body is offered by superior control, not blindly. A human being, therefore, must be on his guard as to what sort of body he is going to have in the next life. An irresponsible life of indiscrimination is risky, and that is the declaration of all scriptures.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

He can simply think of doing something independently, but he cannot act independently. This independence in thinking is there by the grace of the Lord, but the thinking can be given shape by the grace of the Lord, and therefore the common saying is that man proposes and God disposes. The whole explanation is on the subject of the absolute dependence of the living entities and absolute independence of the Supreme Lord.

No one, therefore, can claim any proprietorship of the senses. The living entity is controlled by the senses, the senses are controlled by the demigods, and the demigods are the servants of the Supreme Lord. That is the arrangement in the system of creation. The whole thing is controlled ultimately by the Supreme Lord, and there is no independence either of the material nature or of the living entity. The illusioned living entity who claims to be the lord of his senses is under the clutches of the external energy of the Lord.

Men are moving by cars and rails on the roads, by subways within the earth and by planes in the sky for the purpose of business success. But in all these movements the real purpose is to earn wealth for comfortable life. For this comfortable life the scientist is engaged, the artist is engaged, the engineer is engaged, the technician is engaged, all in different branches of human activity. But they do not know how to make the activities purposeful to fulfill the mission of human life.

But such a wrong conception of life cannot give anyone the desired peace of mind, and thus in spite of all advancement in knowledge by use of the resources of nature, no one is happy in this material civilization.

The woman is the object of sexual pleasure, and both the sense perception of sexual pleasure and the woman are controlled by the Praj&#257;pati, who is under the control of the Lord's genitals. The impersonalist must know from this verse that the Lord is not impersonal, for He has His genitals, on which all the pleasurable objects of sex depend. No one would have taken the trouble to maintain children if there were no taste of heavenly nectar by means of sexual intercourse. This material world is created to give the conditioned souls a chance for rejuvenation for going back home, back to Godhead, and therefore generation of the living being is necessary for upkeep of the purpose of creation. Sexual pleasure is an impetus for such action, and as such one can even serve the Lord in the act of such sexual pleasure. The service is counted when the children born of such sexual pleasure are properly trained in God consciousness. The whole idea of material creation is to revive the dormant God consciousness of the living entity. In forms of life other than the human form, sexual pleasure is prominent without any motive of service for the mission of the Lord. But in the human form of life the conditioned soul can render service to the Lord by creating progeny suitable for the attainment of salvation. One can beget hundreds of children and enjoy the celestial pleasure of sexual intercourse, provided he is able to train the children in God consciousness. Otherwise begetting children is on the level of the swine. Rather, the swine is more expert than the human being because the swine can beget a dozen piglets at a time, whereas the human being can give birth to only one at a time. So one should always remember that the genitals, sexual pleasure, the woman and the offspring are all related in the service of the Lord, and one who forgets this relationship in the service of the Supreme Lord becomes subjected to the threefold miseries of material existence by the laws of nature. Perception of sexual pleasure is there even in the body of the dog, but there is no sense of God consciousness. The human form of life is distinct from that of the dog by the perception of God consciousness.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

When, therefore, the Supersoul is situated in the heart of the conditioned soul, the requisite mind is manifested in the conditioned soul, and he becomes conscious of his occupation as one is conscious of his duty after waking up from slumber. Therefore the material mind of the living entity develops when the Supersoul sits on his heart, after which the mind, the controlling deity (moon), and then the activities of the mind (namely thinking, feeling and willing) all take place.

Mind is the instrument for feeling different material experiences, but intelligence is deliberative and can change everything for the better. The intelligent person, therefore, can attain salvation from the illusion of material existence by proper use of intelligence. An intelligent person can detect the awkward position of material existence and thus begin to inquire as to what he is, why he is subjected to different kinds of miseries, and how to get rid of all miseries, and thus, by good association, an advanced intelligent person can turn towards the better life of self-realization. It is advised, therefore, that an intelligent person associate with the great sages and saints who are on the path of salvation. By such association, one can receive instructions which are able to slacken the conditioned soul's attachment for matter, and thus the intelligent man gradually gets rid of the illusion of matter and false ego and is promoted to the real life of eternity, knowledge and bliss.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

All these are emanations from the Personality of Godhead as His external energy. These coverings are just like the covering of clouds for the sun. The cloud is a creation of the sun, yet it actually covers the eyes so that one cannot see the sun. The sun cannot be covered by the clouds. The cloud can at utmost extend a few hundreds of miles in the sky, but the sun is far greater than millions of miles. So a hundred-mile covering is not competent to cover millions of miles. Therefore, one of the various energies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot, of course, cover the Lord. But these coverings are created by Him to cover the eyes of the conditioned souls who want to lord it over the material nature. Actually the conditioned souls are covered by the illusory creative cloud of matter, and the Lord reserves the right of not being exposed to their eyes. Because they have no eyes of transcendental vision and because they cannot see the Personality of Godhead, they therefore deny the existence of the Lord and the transcendental form of the Lord.

Anything which has a beginning, interim and end is called material. The material world is begun from the Lord, and thus the form of the Lord, before the beginning of the material world, is certainly transcendental to the finest, or the finer material conception. The ether in the material world is considered to be the finest. Finer than the ether is mind, intelligence, and false ego. But all eight of the outward coverings are explained as outer coverings of the Absolute Truth. The Absolute Truth is therefore beyond the expression and speculation of the material conception. He is certainly transcendental to all material conceptions. This is called <span class="Italic">nirvi&#347;e&#7779;a&#7751;am.</span> One should not, however, misunderstand <span class="Italic">nirvi&#347;e&#7779;a&#7751;am</span> as being without any transcendental qualifications. <span class="Italic">Vi&#347;e&#7779;a&#7751;am</span> means qualities. Therefore <span class="Italic">nir</span> added to it means that he has no material qualities or variegatedness. This nullifying expression is described in four transcendental qualifications, namely unmanifested, transcendental, eternal, and beyond the conception of mind or word. Beyond the limits of words means negation of the material conception. Unless one is transcendentally situated, it is not possible to know the transcendental form of the Lord.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

On the one hand they worship the Lord in His <span class="Italic">vi&#347;va-r&#363;pa,</span> or all-pervading universal form, and on the other they think of the Lord's unmanifested, indescribable, subtle form. The theories of pantheism and monism are respectively applicable to these two conceptions of the Supreme as gross and subtle, but both of them are rejected by the learned pure devotees of the Lord because they are aware of the factual position. This is very clearly mentioned in the Eleventh Chapter of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> which records Arjuna's experience of the <span class="Italic">vi&#347;va-r&#363;pa</span> of the Supreme Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div><A NAME="28267"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">ad&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;a-p&#363;rva&#7745; h&#7771;&#7779;ito 'smi d&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;v&#257;<br>bhayena ca pravyathita&#7745; mano me<br>tad eva me dar&#347;aya deva r&#363;pa&#7745;<br>pras&#299;da deve&#347;a jagan-niv&#257;sa</div></div><A NAME="28268"></A><div class="VerseRef">(Bg. <a href="index544a.html?g=4049">11.45</a>)</div><A NAME="28269"></A><div class="After-Verse">Arjuna, as a pure devotee of the Lord, never previously saw the contemplated universal form of the Lord (<span class="Italic">vi&#347;va-r&#363;pa</span>), but when he did see it, his curiosities were satisfied. But he was not happy to see such a form of the Lord because of his attachment as a pure devotee. He was afraid to see the gigantic form of the Lord. He therefore prayed to the Lord to assume His four-handed N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a form, which alone could please Arjuna. Undoubtedly the Lord has the supreme potency to exhibit Himself in multifarious forms, but the pure devotees of the Lord are interested in His forms as eternally exhibited in the abode of the Lord, known as the <span class="Italic">trip&#257;d-vibh&#363;ti</span> or kingdom of God. The Lord in the <span class="Italic">trip&#257;d-vibh&#363;ti</span> abode exhibits Himself in two forms, either with four hands or with two hands. The <span class="Italic">vi&#347;va-r&#363;pa</span> exhibited in the material manifestation has unlimited hands and unlimited dimensions with everything unlimited. The pure devotees of the Lord worship Him in His Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha forms as N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Sometimes the same Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha forms of the Lord are in the material world also by His grace as &#346;r&#299; R&#257;ma, &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, &#346;r&#299; Narasi&#7745;hadeva, etc., and thus the pure devotees also worship them. Usually the features shown in the material world have no existence in the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets, and thus they are not accepted by the pure devotees. What the pure devotees worship from the very beginning are eternal forms of the Lord existing in the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets. The nondevotee impersonalists imagine the material forms of the Lord, and ultimately they merge in the impersonal <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> of the Lord, whereas the pure devotees of the Lord are worshipers of the Lord both in the beginning and also in the perfect stage of salvation, eternally. The worship of the pure devotee never stops, whereas the worship of the impersonalist stops after his attainment of salvation, when he merges in the impersonal form of the Lord known as the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti.</span> Therefore the pure devotees of the Lord are described here as <span class="Italic">vipa&#347;cita,</span> or the learned who are in the knowledge of the Lord perfectly.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

One should be intelligent enough to know His activities in truth and not be biased to conclude that He descends to the material world by accepting a form created by material nature. Any form accepted from the material nature has its affection for everything done in the material world. A conditioned soul who accepts a material form for undergoing a certain term of material activities is subjected to the laws of matter. But here in this verse it is clearly stated that although the forms and activities of the Lord appear to be the same as those of a conditioned soul, they are supernatural and impossible for the conditioned soul. He, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is always unaffected by such activities. In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexa9b3.html?g=1550">4.14</a>) the Lord says:</div><A NAME="28284"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">na m&#257;&#7745; karm&#257;&#7751;i limpanti<br>na me karma-phale sp&#7771;h&#257;<br>iti m&#257;&#7745; yo 'bhij&#257;n&#257;ti<br>karmabhir na sa badhyate</div></div><A NAME="28285"></A><div class="After-Verse">The Lord is never affected by the activities which He apparently performs by His different incarnations and personalities, nor does He have any desire to achieve success by fruitive activities. The Lord is full by His different potencies of wealth, strength, fame, beauty, knowledge and renunciation, and thus He has no reason for physical exertion like the conditioned soul. Therefore an intelligent person who can distinguish between the transcendental activities of the Lord and the activities of the conditioned souls is also not bound by the reactions of activities. The Lord as Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, Brahm&#257; and &#346;iva conducts the three modes of material nature. From Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is born Brahm&#257;, and from Brahm&#257; is born &#346;iva. Sometimes Brahm&#257; is a separated part of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and sometimes Brahm&#257; is Vi&#7779;&#7751;u Himself. Thus Brahm&#257; creates the different species of life all over the universe, which means that the Lord creates the whole manifestation either by Himself or through the agency of His authorized deputies.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Although every living being is seen to come out of the mother's body, it is still a fact that the mother is not the ultimate cause of such a birth. The father is the ultimate cause of birth. Without the father's seed, no mother can give birth to a child. Therefore the living beings in different varieties of forms and positions within the innumerable universes are all born of the seeds of the Almighty Father, the Personality of Godhead, and only to the man with a poor fund of knowledge they appear to be born of the material nature.

The intelligent person should not try to be promoted from third-class prison life to first-class prison life, but should try to be released from the prison altogether. One may be promoted to first-class prisoner, but the same first-class prisoner is again degraded to a third-class prisoner in the next term. One should try to be free from prison life and go back home, back to Godhead. That is the real goal for all types of living entities.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

O King, even a particular mode of nature, being mixed with the other two, is divided into three, and thus each kind of living creature is influenced by the other modes and acquires its habits also.</div><A NAME="28330"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="28331"></A><div class="First">The living entities individually are being conducted by a particular mode of nature, but at the same time there is every chance of their being influenced by the other two. Generally, all conditioned souls in the material encagement are influenced by the mode of passion because every one of them is trying to lord it over the material nature to fulfill his individual desire. But in spite of the individual mode of passion, there is always the chance of being influenced by the other modes of nature by association. If one is in good association he can develop the mode of goodness, and if in bad association he may develop the mode of darkness or ignorance. Nothing is stereotyped. One can change his habit by good or bad association, and one has to become intelligent enough to discriminate between good and bad. The best association is the service of the devotees of the Lord, and by that association one can become the highest qualified man by the grace of the Lord's pure devotees. As we have already seen in the life of &#346;r&#299;la N&#257;rada Muni, he became the topmost devotee of the Lord simply by the association of pure devotees of the Lord. By birth he was the son of a maidservant and had no knowledge of his father and no academic education, even of the lowest status. But simply by associating with the devotees and by eating the remnants of their foodstuff, he gradually developed the transcendental qualities of the devotees. By such association, his taste for chanting and hearing the transcendental glories of the Lord became prominent, and because the glories of the Lord are nondifferent from the Lord, he got direct association with the Lord by means of sound representation. Similarly, there is the life of Aj&#257;mila (Sixth Canto), who was the son of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> and was educated and trained properly in the discharge of the duties of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> but who in spite of all this, because he contacted the bad association of a prostitute, was put into the path of the lowest quality of <span class="Italic">ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la,</span> or the last position for a human being. Therefore the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> always recommends the association of the <span class="Italic">mahat,</span> or the great soul, for opening the gate of salvation. To associate with persons engaged in lording it over the material world means to enter into the darkest region of hell. One should try to raise himself by the association of the great soul. That is the way of the perfection of life.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

His transcendental position is always unchanged. He is the eternal form of knowledge and bliss, and He executes His almighty will by His different energies. As such, He is never the subject of reactions for any of His acts. He is transcendental to all such conceptions of actions and reactions. Even if He is visible in the material world, the exhibition is only of His internal energy, for He is above the good and bad conceptions of this material world. In the material world the fish or the hog may be considered lower than the man, but when the Lord appears as a fish or hog, He is neither of them in the material conception. It is His causeless mercy that He appears in every society or species of life, but He is never to be considered one of them. Conceptions of the material world such as good and bad, lower and upper, important and insignificant, are estimations of the material energy, and the Supreme Lord is transcendental to all such conceptions. The words <span class="Italic">para&#7745; bh&#257;vam,</span> or transcendental nature, can never be compared to the material conception. We should not forget that the potencies of the Almighty Lord are always the same and do not decrease because the Lord assumes the form of a lower animal. There is no difference between Lord &#346;r&#299; R&#257;ma, Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and His incarnations as a fish and hog. He is all-pervading and simultaneously localized at any and every place. But the foolish person with a poor fund of knowledge, for want of that <span class="Italic">para&#7745; bh&#257;vam</span> of the Lord, cannot understand how the Supreme Lord can take the form of a man or a fish. One compares everything to one's own standard of knowledge, as the frog in the well considers the sea to be like the well. The frog in the well cannot even think of the sea, and when such a frog is informed of the greatness of the sea, it takes the conception of the sea as being a little greater than the well. As such, one who is foolish about the transcendental science of the Lord will find it difficult to understand how Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u can equally manifest Himself in every society of living entities.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The foolish conditioned soul who has taken this temporary world as a permanent settlement has to learn intelligently why such creation and destruction take place. The fruitive actors in the material world are very enthusiastic in the creation of big enterprises, big houses, big empires, big industries and so many big, big things out of the energy and ingredients supplied by the material agent of the Supreme Lord. With such resources, and at the cost of valuable energy, the conditioned soul creates, satisfies his whims, but unwillingly has to depart from all his creations and enter into another phase of life to create again and again. To give hope to such foolish conditioned souls who waste their energy in this temporary material world, the Lord gives information that there is another nature, which is eternally existent without being occasionally created or destroyed, and that the conditioned soul can understand what he should do and how his valuable energy may be utilized. Instead of wasting his energy in matter, which is sure to be destroyed in due course by the supreme will, the conditioned soul should utilize his energy in the devotional service of the Lord so that he can be transferred to the other, eternal nature, where there is no birth, no death, no creation, no destruction, but permanent life instead, full of knowledge and unlimited bliss. The temporary creation is thus exhibited and destroyed just to give information to the conditioned soul who is attached to temporary things.

Gross materialists without any knowledge of Brahman, Param&#257;tm&#257; or Bhagav&#257;n conclude material nature to be the ultimate cause of the material manifestation, and the modern scientist also shares this view that the material nature is the ultimate cause of all the manifestations of the material world. This view is refuted by all Vedic literature.

Therefore inert matter cannot be the ultimate cause of the creation, maintenance and destruction of the material world. Superficially material nature appears to be the cause of creation, maintenance and destruction, but material nature is set into motion for creation by the supreme conscious being, the Personality of Godhead. He is the background of all creation, maintenance and destruction, and this is confirmed in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index652d.html?g=3075">9.10</a>):</div><A NAME="28396"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">may&#257;dhyak&#7779;e&#7751;a prak&#7771;ti&#7717;<br>s&#363;yate sa-car&#257;caram<br>hetun&#257;nena kaunteya<br>jagad viparivartate</div></div><A NAME="28397"></A><div class="After-Verse">The material nature is one of the energies of the Lord, and she can work under the direction of the Lord (<span class="Italic">adhyak&#7779;e&#7751;a</span>).

Although it appears to the layman that the mother gives birth to the child, the experienced man knows that the father gives birth to the child. The material nature therefore produces the moving and standing manifestations of the material world after being contacted by the supreme father, and not independently. Considering material nature to be the cause of creation, maintenance, etc., is called "the logic of nipples on the neck of a goat."

The example of electrification is quite appropriate. A piece of iron is certainly not fire, but when the iron is made red-hot, certainly it has the quality of fire through its burning capacity. Matter is compared to the piece of iron, and it is electrified or made red-hot by the glance or manipulation of the supreme consciousness of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Only by such electrification is the energy of matter displayed in various actions and reactions. Therefore the inert matter is neither efficient nor the material cause of the cosmic manifestation. &#346;r&#299; Kapiladeva has said:</div><A NAME="28401"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">yatholmuk&#257;d visphuli&#7749;g&#257;d<br>dh&#363;m&#257;d v&#257;pi sva-sambhav&#257;t<br>apy &#257;tmatven&#257;bhimat&#257;d<br>yath&#257;gni&#7717; p&#7771;thag ulmuk&#257;t</div></div><A NAME="28402"></A><div class="VerseRef">(<span class="Ref_Italic">SB</span> <a href="indexfe49.html?g=27452">3.28.40</a>)</div><A NAME="28403"></A><div class="After-Verse">The original fire, its flame, its sparks and its smoke are all one, for fire is still fire yet is different from the flame, flame is different from sparks, and sparks are different from the smoke. In every one of them, namely in the flames, in the sparks and in the smoke, the integrity of fire is present, yet all of them are differently situated with different positions. The cosmic manifestation is compared to the smoke because when smoke passes over the sky so many forms appear, resembling many known and unknown manifestations. The sparks are compared to living entities, and the flames are compared to material nature (<span class="Italic">pradh&#257;na</span>). One must know that each and every one of them is effective simply because of being empowered by the quality of the original fire. Therefore all of them, namely the material nature, the cosmic manifestation and the living entities, are but different energies of the Lord (fire). Therefore those who accept the material nature as the cosmic manifestation's original cause (<span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti,</span> the cause of creation according to S&#257;&#7749;khya philosophy) are not correct in their conclusion. The material nature has no separate existence without the Lord.

There are two classes of men, namely those too addicted to the gross body and the material world, and others, on the higher level, who are interested more in transcendental knowledge. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> gives facility to everyone, both to the materialist and to the transcendentalist. By hearing <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> in the matter of the Lord's glorious activities both in the material world and in the transcendental world, men can derive equal benefit. The materialists are more interested in the physical laws and how they are acting, and they see wonders in those physical glamors. Sometimes, due to physical glamors, they forget the glories of the Lord. They should know definitely that physical activities and their wonders are all initiated by the Lord. The rose in the garden gradually takes its shape and color to become beautiful and sweet not by a blind physical law, although it appears like that. Behind that physical law is the direction of the complete consciousness of the Supreme Lord, otherwise things cannot take shape so systematically. The artist draws a picture of a rose very nicely with all attention and artistic sense, and yet it does not become as perfect as the real rose. If that is the real fact, how can we say that the real rose has taken its shape without intelligence behind the beauty? This sort of conclusion is due to a poor fund of knowledge. One must know from the above description of creation and annihilation that the supreme consciousness, being omnipresent, can take care of everything with perfect attention. That is the fact of the omnipresence of the Supreme Lord. Persons, still more foolish than the gross materialists, however, claim to be transcendentalists and claim to have such supreme all-pervading consciousness, but offer no proof. Such foolish persons cannot know what is going on behind the next wall, yet they are falsely proud of possessing the cosmic, all-pervading consciousness of the Supreme Person. For them also, hearing of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is a great help. It will open their eyes to see that simply by claiming supreme consciousness one does not become supremely conscious. One has to prove in the physical world that he has such supreme consciousness. The <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is</span> of Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya, however, were above the gross materialists and the false transcendentalists, and thus they were always anxious to know the real truth in transcendental matters, as discussed by authorities.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>
