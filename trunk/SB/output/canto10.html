<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The summary of the First Chapter is as follows. This chapter describes how Ka&#7745;sa, frightened by hearing an omen about his being killed by the eighth son of Devak&#299;, killed Devak&#299;&rsquo;s sons one after another.</div>
</div><A NAME="120687"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">When &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; finished describing the dynasty of Yadu, as well as the dynasties of the moon-god and sun-god, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it requested him to describe Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who appeared with Baladeva in the Yadu dynasty, and how K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a performed His activities within this world. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is transcendental, the King said, and therefore to understand His activities is the occupation of liberated persons. Hearing of <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-l&#299;l&#257;</span> is the boat by which to achieve the ultimate goal of life. Except for an animal killer or one who is following a policy of suicide, every intelligent person must strive to understand K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and His activities.</div>
</div><A NAME="120688"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was the only worshipable Deity for the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas. When Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was in the womb of his mother, Uttar&#257;, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a saved him from the attack of the <span class="Italic">brahma-&#347;astra.</span> Now Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it asked &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; how His Lordship Baladeva, the son of Rohi&#7751;&#299;, could have appeared in the womb of Devak&#299;. Why did K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a transfer Himself from Mathur&#257; to V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, King Par&#299;k&#7779;it asked, and how did He live there with His family members? What did K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a do in Mathur&#257; and V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, and why did He kill His maternal uncle Ka&#7745;sa? For how many years did K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a reside in Dv&#257;rak&#257;, and how many queens did He have? Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it asked &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; all these questions. He also requested &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; to describe other activities of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a about which he could not inquire.</div>
</div><A NAME="120689"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">When &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; began to speak about K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it forgot the fatigue brought about by his fasting. Enthusiastic to describe K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; said, &ldquo;Like the waters of the Ganges, descriptions of the activities of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a can purify the entire universe. The speaker, the inquirer and the audience all become purified.&rdquo;</div>
</div><A NAME="120690"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Once when the entire world was overburdened by the increasing military power of demons in the form of kings, mother earth assumed the shape of a cow and approached Lord Brahm&#257; for relief, Sympathetic to mother earth&rsquo;s lamentation, Brahm&#257;, accompanied by Lord &#346;iva and other demigods, took the cow-shaped mother earth to the shore of the milk ocean, where he offered prayers to please Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, who lay there on an island in transcendental ecstasy. Brahm&#257; thereafter understood the advice of Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, who informed him that He would appear on the surface of the earth to mitigate the burden created by the demons. The demigods, along with their wives, should appear there as associates of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in the family of Yadu to increase the sons and grandsons in that dynasty. By the will of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Anantadeva would appear first, as Balar&#257;ma, and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s potency, <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;,</span> would also appear. Brahm&#257; informed mother earth about all this, and then he returned to his own abode.</div>
</div><A NAME="120691"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">After marrying Devak&#299;, Vasudeva was returning home with her on a chariot driven by Ka&#7745;sa, her brother, when an ominous voice addressed Ka&#7745;sa, warning him that Devak&#299;&rsquo;s eighth son would kill him. Upon hearing this omen, Ka&#7745;sa was immediately ready to kill Devak&#299;, but Vasudeva diplomatically began to instruct him. Vasudeva stressed that it would not be good for Ka&#7745;sa to kill his younger sister, especially at the time of her marriage. Anyone who possesses a material body must die, Vasudeva advised him. Every living entity lives in a body for some time and then transmigrates to another body, but one is unfortunately misled into accepting the body as the soul. If a person under this mistaken conception wants to kill another body, he is condemned as hellish.</div>
</div><A NAME="120692"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Because Ka&#7745;sa was not satisfied by Vasudeva&rsquo;s instructions, Vasudeva devised a plan. He offered to bring Ka&#7745;sa all of Devak&#299;&rsquo;s children so that Ka&#7745;sa could kill them. Why then should Ka&#7745;sa kill Devak&#299; now? Ka&#7745;sa was satisfied by this proposal. In due course of time, when Devak&#299; gave birth to a child, Vasudeva brought the newborn baby to Ka&#7745;sa, who, upon seeing Vasudeva&rsquo;s magnanimity, was struck with wonder. When Vasudeva gave Ka&#7745;sa the child, Ka&#7745;sa, showing some intelligence, said that since he was to be killed by the eighth child, why should he kill the first? Although Vasudeva did not trust him, Ka&#7745;sa requested Vasudeva to take the child back. Later, however, after N&#257;rada approached Ka&#7745;sa and disclosed to him that the demigods were appearing in the Yadu and V&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;i dynasties and conspiring to kill him, Ka&#7745;sa decided to kill all the children born in these families, and he also decided that any child born from the womb of Devak&#299; must be killed. Thus he arrested and imprisoned both Devak&#299; and Vasudeva and killed six of their sons, one after another. N&#257;rada had also informed Ka&#7745;sa that in his previous birth Ka&#7745;sa was K&#257;lanemi, a demon killed by Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Consequently, Ka&#7745;sa became a great enemy to all the descendants of the <span class="Italic">yadu-va&#7745;&#347;a,</span> the Yadu dynasty. He even arrested and imprisoned his own father, Ugrasena, for Ka&#7745;sa wanted to enjoy the kingdom alone.</div>

<div class="First">At the end of the Ninth Canto, Twenty-fourth Chapter, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; summarized the activities of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. He spoke of how K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a had personally appeared to reduce the burden on the earth, how He had manifested His pastimes as a householder, and how, soon after His birth, He had transferred Himself to His Vrajabh&#363;mi-l&#299;l&#257;.

Therefore, to encourage &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; to continue speaking about K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and give further details, he thanked &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; for having described the activities of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in brief. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; had said:</div>

In V&#7771;nd&#257;vana the Lord killed many demons, and afterward He returned to Dv&#257;rak&#257;, where according to Vedic principles He married many wives who were the best of women, begot through them hundreds of sons, and performed sacrifices for His own worship to establish the principles of householder life.&rdquo; (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="index9f83.html?g=75206">9.24.66</a>)</div>
<div class="Purport">The Yadu dynasty belonged to the family descending from Soma, the moon-god. Although the planetary systems are so arranged that the sun comes first, before the moon, Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja gave more respect to the dynasty of the moon-god, the <span class="Italic">soma-va&#7745;&#347;a,</span> because in the Y&#257;dava dynasty, descending from the moon, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a had appeared. There are two different <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> families of the royal order, one descending from the king of the moon planet and the other descending from the king of the sun. Whenever the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears, He generally appears in a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> family because He comes to establish religious principles and the life of righteousness. According to the Vedic system, the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> family is the protector of the human race. When the Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared as Lord R&#257;macandra, He appeared in the <span class="Italic">s&#363;rya-va&#7745;&#347;a,</span> the family descending from the sun-god, and when He appeared as Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, He did so in the Yadu dynasty, or <span class="Italic">yadu-va&#7745;&#347;a,</span> whose descent was from the moon-god. In the Ninth Canto, Twenty-fourth Chapter, of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> there is a long list of the kings of the <span class="Italic">yadu-va&#7745;&#347;a.</span> All the kings in both the <span class="Italic">soma-va&#7745;&#347;a</span> and <span class="Italic">s&#363;rya-va&#7745;&#347;a</span> were great and powerful, and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it praised them very highly (<span class="Italic">r&#257;j&ntilde;&#257;&#7745; cobhaya-va&#7745;&#347;y&#257;n&#257;&#7745; carita&#7745; param&#257;dbhutam</span>). Nonetheless, he wanted to hear more about the <span class="Italic">soma-va&#7745;&#347;a</span> because that was the dynasty in which K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a had appeared.</div>
<div class="Purport">The supreme abode of the Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, is described in <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> as the abode of <span class="Italic">cint&#257;ma&#7751;i:</span> <span class="Italic">cint&#257;ma&#7751;i-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-v&#7771;k&#7779;a-lak&#7779;&#257;v&#7771;te&#7779;u surabh&#299;r abhip&#257;layantam</I> [Bs. </span></I>5.29</I>]<span class="Italic"></I>.</span> The V&#7771;nd&#257;vana-dh&#257;ma on this earth is a replica of that same abode.

The manifested world can be seen in the form of many stars and planets such as the sun and moon, but beyond this is the unmanifested, which is imperceptible to those who are embodied. And beyond this unmanifested matter is the spiritual kingdom, which is described in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as supreme and eternal. That kingdom is never annihilated. Although material nature is subject to repeated creation and annihilation, that spiritual nature remains as it is eternally. In the Tenth Canto of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> that spiritual nature, the spiritual world, is described as V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, Goloka V&#7771;nd&#257;vana or Vraja-dh&#257;ma.

A Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is <span class="Italic">niv&#7771;tta-t&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a;</span> that is, he has no material purpose, for his only purpose is to preach K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. So-called scholars, philosophers and politicians exploit the importance of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> by distorting its meaning for their own purposes. Therefore this verse warns that <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-kath&#257;</span> should be recited by a person who is <span class="Italic">niv&#7771;tta-t&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</span> &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; epitomizes the proper reciter for <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> and Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, who purposefully left his kingdom and family prior to meeting death, epitomizes the person fit to hear it. A qualified reciter of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> gives the right medicine (<span class="Italic">bhavau&#7779;adhi</span>) for the conditioned souls. The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is therefore trying to train qualified preachers to recite <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> and <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> throughout the entire world, so that people in general in all parts of the world may take advantage of this movement and thus be relieved of the threefold miseries of material existence.</div>
<div class="Purport">The instructions of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and the descriptions of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> are so pleasing that almost anyone suffering from the threefold miseries of material existence will desire to hear the glories of the Lord from these books and thus benefit on the path of liberation. Two classes of men, however, will never be interested in hearing the message of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span>&mdash;those who are determined to commit suicide and those determined to kill cows and other animals for the satisfaction of their own tongues. Although such persons may make a show of hearing <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> at a <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata-sapt&#257;ha,</span> this is but another creation of the <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s,</span> who cannot derive any benefit from such a performance. The word <span class="Italic">pa&#347;u-ghn&#257;t</span> is important in this connection. <span class="Italic">pa&#347;u-ghna</span> means &ldquo;butcher.&rdquo; Persons fond of performing ritualistic ceremonies for elevation to the higher planetary systems must offer sacrifices (<span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;as</span>) by killing animals. Lord Buddhadeva therefore rejected the authority of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> because his mission was to stop animal sacrifices, which are recommended in Vedic ritualistic ceremonies.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">Anyone who is not K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious and who therefore does not engage in the service of the Lord is also <span class="Italic">pa&#347;u-ghna,</span> for he is willingly drinking poison. Such a person cannot be interested in <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-kath&#257;</span> because he still has a desire for material sense gratification; he is not <span class="Italic">niv&#7771;tta-t&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</span> As it is said, <span class="Italic">traivargik&#257;s te puru&#7779;&#257; vimukh&#257; hari-medhasa&#7717;.</span> Those interested in <span class="Italic">trivarga</span>&mdash;that is, in <span class="Italic">dharma, artha</span> and <span class="Italic">k&#257;ma</span>&mdash;are religious for the sake of achieving a material position with which to gain better facilities for sense gratification. Such persons are killing themselves by willingly keeping themselves in the cycle of birth and death. They cannot be interested in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purport">For <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-kath&#257;,</span> topics about K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, there must be a speaker and a hearer, both of whom can be interested in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness if they are no longer interested in material topics. One can actually see how this attitude automatically develops in persons who are K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious. Although the devotees of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement are quite young men, they no longer read materialistic newspapers, magazines and so on, for they are no longer interested in such topics (<span class="Italic">niv&#7771;tta-tar&#7779;ai&#7717;</span>). They completely give up the bodily understanding of life. For topics concerning Uttama&#347;loka, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the spiritual master speaks, and the disciple hears with attention. Unless both of them are free from material desires, they cannot be interested in topics of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. The spiritual master and disciple do not need to understand anything more than K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a because simply by understanding K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and talking about K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, one becomes a perfectly learned person (<span class="Italic">yasmin vij&ntilde;&#257;te sarvam eva&#7745; vij&ntilde;&#257;ta&#7745; bhavati</span>). The Lord sits within everyone&rsquo;s heart, and by the grace of the Lord the devotee receives instructions directly from the Lord Himself, who says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">sarvasya c&#257;ha&#7745; h&#7771;di sannivi&#7779;&#7789;o<br>matta&#7717; sm&#7771;tir j&ntilde;&#257;nam apohana&#7745; ca<br>vedai&#347; ca sarvair aham eva vedyo<br>ved&#257;nta-k&#7771;d veda-vid eva c&#257;ham</div>
</div><A NAME="120771"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;I am seated in everyone&rsquo;s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness. By all the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> I am to be known; indeed, I am the compiler of <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta,</span> and I am the knower of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span>&rdquo; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness is so exalted that one who is perfectly situated in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, under the direction of the spiritual master, is fully satisfied by reading <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-kath&#257;</span> as found in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and similar Vedic literatures. Since merely talking about K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is so pleasing, we can simply imagine how pleasing it is to render service to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>
<div class="Purport">When discourses on <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-kath&#257;</span> take place between a liberated spiritual master and his disciple, others also sometimes take advantage of hearing these topics and also benefit. These topics are the medicine to stop the repetition of birth and death. The cycle of repeated birth and death, by which one takes on different bodies again and again, is called <span class="Italic">bhava</span> or <span class="Italic">bhava-roga.</span> If anyone, willingly or unwillingly, hears <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-kath&#257;,</span> his <span class="Italic">bhava-roga,</span> the disease of birth and death, will certainly stop. Therefore <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-kath&#257;</span> is called <span class="Italic">bhavau&#7779;adha,</span> the remedy to stop the repetition of birth and death. <span class="Italic">Karm&#299;s,</span> or persons attached to material sense enjoyment, generally cannot give up their material desires, but <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-kath&#257;</span> is such a potent medicine that if one is induced to hear <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-k&#299;rtana,</span> he will certainly be freed from this disease. A practical example is Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, who at the end of his <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> was fully satisfied. When the Lord wanted to give Dhruva a benediction, Dhruva refused it. <span class="Italic">Sv&#257;min k&#7771;t&#257;rtho&rsquo;smi vara&#7745; na y&#257;ce.</span> &ldquo;My dear Lord,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am fully satisfied. I do not ask for any benediction for material sense gratification.&rdquo; We actually see that even young boys and girls in the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement have given up their long practice of bad habits like illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. Because K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness is so potent that it gives them full satisfaction, they are no longer interested in material sense gratification.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;For one who has accepted the boat of the lotus feet of the Lord, who is the shelter of the cosmic manifestation and is famous as Mur&#257;ri, or the enemy of the Mura demon, the ocean of the material world is like the water contained in a calf&rsquo;s hoofprint.

<div class="Purport">One who seeks shelter at the lotus feet of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is immediately protected by the Lord. As the Lord promises in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index3a32.html?g=5997">18.66</a>), <span class="Italic">aha&#7745; tv&#257;&#7745; sarva-p&#257;pebhyo mok&#7779;ayi&#7779;y&#257;mi m&#257; &#347;uca&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;I shall deliver you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.&rdquo; By taking shelter of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, one comes under the safest protection. Thus when the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas took shelter at the lotus feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, all of them were on the safe side of the Battlefield of Kuruk&#7779;etra. Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, therefore, felt obliged to think of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in the last days of his life. This is the ideal result of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness: <span class="Italic">ante n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a-sm&#7771;ti&#7717;.</span> If at the time of death one can remember K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, one&rsquo;s life is successful. Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, therefore, because of his many obligations to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, intelligently decided to think of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a constantly during the last days of his life. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a had saved the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it&rsquo;s grandfathers, on the Battlefield of Kuruk&#7779;etra, and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a had saved Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it himself when he was attacked by the <span class="Italic">brahm&#257;stra</span> of A&#347;vatth&#257;m&#257;. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a acted as the friend and worshipable Deity of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ava family. Moreover, apart from Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s personal contact with the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the Supersoul of all living entities, and He gives everyone liberation, even if one is not a pure devotee. Ka&#7745;sa, for example, was not at all a devotee, yet K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, after killing him, gave him salvation. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness is beneficial to everyone, whether one is a pure devotee or a nondevotee. This is the glory of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. Considering this, who will not take shelter at the lotus feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is described in this verse as <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;-manu&#7779;ya</span> because He descends exactly like a human being.

I therefore wrapped a dead snake over his shoulder, and that is why I was cursed by the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> boy. Now, however, I am quite fit. I am not at all disturbed by my hunger and thirst.&rdquo; This indicates that although on the material platform there are disturbances from hunger and thirst, on the spiritual platform there is no such thing as fatigue.</div>

This is <span class="Italic">dharmasya gl&#257;ni,</span> deviation from the goal of life. Human life is meant for attaining the highest perfection of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, but when people are godless and the presidents or kings are unnecessarily puffed up with military power, their business is to fight and increase the military strength of their different states. Nowadays, therefore, it appears that every state is busy manufacturing atomic weapons to prepare for a third world war. Such preparations are certainly unnecessary; they reflect the false pride of the heads of state. The real business of a chief executive is to see to the happiness of the mass of people by training them in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness in different divisions of life. <span class="Italic">C&#257;tur-var&#7751;ya&#7745; may&#257; s&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;a&#7745; gu&#7751;a-karma-vibh&#257;ga&#347;a&#7717;</span> (Bg. <a href="indexd112.html?g=1541">4.13</a>).

Instead, however, rogues and thieves in the guise of protectors arrange for a voting system, and in the name of democracy they come to power by hook or crook and exploit the citizens. Even long, long ago, <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> persons devoid of God consciousness, became the heads of state, and now this is happening again. The various states of the world are preoccupied with arranging for military strength. Sometimes they spend sixty-five percent of the government&rsquo;s revenue for this purpose. But why should people&rsquo;s hard-earned money be spent in this way? Because of the present world situation, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a has descended in the form of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement.

<div class="Translation">While in trance, Lord Brahm&#257; heard the words of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u vibrating in the sky. Thus he told the demigods: O demigods, hear from me the order of K&#7779;&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Supreme Person, and execute it attentively without delay.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">It appears that the words of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be heard in trance by competent persons. Modern science gives us telephones, by which one can hear sound vibrations from a distant place. Similarly, although other persons cannot hear the words of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, Lord Brahm&#257; is able to hear the Lord&rsquo;s words within himself. This is confirmed in the beginning of <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="index4dab.html?g=6120">1.1.1</a>): <span class="Italic">tene brahma h&#7771;d&#257; ya &#257;di-kavaye.</span> <span class="Italic">&#256;di-kavi</span> is Lord Brahm&#257;. In the beginning of the creation, Lord Brahm&#257; received the instructions of Vedic knowledge from Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u through the medium of the heart (<span class="Italic">h&#7771;d&#257;</span>). The same principle is confirmed herewith. While Brahm&#257; was in trance, he was able to hear the words of K&#7779;&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and he carried the Lord&rsquo;s message to the demigods. Similarly, in the beginning, Brahm&#257; first received the Vedic knowledge from the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the core of the heart. In both instances the same process was used in transmitting the message to Lord Brahm&#257;. In other words, although Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u was invisible even to Lord Brahm&#257;, Lord Brahm&#257; could hear Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&rsquo;s words through the heart. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is invisible even to Lord Brahm&#257;, yet He descends on this earth and becomes visible to people in general. This is certainly an act of His causeless mercy, but fools and nondevotees think that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is an ordinary historical person. Because they think that the Lord is an ordinary person like them, they are described as <span class="Italic">m&#363;&#7693;ha</span> (<span class="Italic">avaj&#257;nanti m&#257;&#7745; m&#363;&#7693;h&#257;&#7717;</span>). The causeless mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is neglected by such demoniac persons, who cannot understand the instructions of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and who therefore misinterpret them.</div>

<div class="First">In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexe89d.html?g=1505">4.9</a>) the Lord says, <span class="Italic">tyaktv&#257; deha&#7745; punar janma naiti m&#257;m eti:</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexe89d.html?g=1505">4.9</a>] after giving up the material body, the devotee of the Lord returns home, back to Godhead. This means that the devotee is first transferred to the particular universe where the Lord is at that time staying to exhibit His pastimes. There are innumerable universes, and the Lord is appearing in one of these universes at every moment. Therefore His pastimes are called <span class="Italic">nitya-l&#299;l&#257;,</span> eternal pastimes. The Lord&rsquo;s appearance as a child in the house of Devak&#299; takes place continuously in one universe after another. Therefore, the devotee is first transferred to that particular universe where the pastimes of the Lord are current. As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> even if a devotee does not complete the course of devotional service, he enjoys the happiness of the heavenly planets, where the most pious people dwell, and then takes birth in the house of a <span class="Italic">&#347;uci</span> or <span class="Italic">&#347;r&#299;m&#257;n,</span> a pious <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> or a wealthy <span class="Italic">vai&#347;ya</span> (<span class="Italic">&#347;uc&#299;n&#257;&#7745; &#347;r&#299;mat&#257;&#7745; gehe yoga-bhra&#7779;&#7789;o &rsquo;bhij&#257;yate</span>). Thus a pure devotee, even if unable to execute devotional service completely, is transferred to the upper planetary system, where pious people reside. From there, if his devotional service is complete, such a devotee is transferred to the place where the Lord&rsquo;s pastimes are going on. Herein it is said, <span class="Italic">sambhavantu sura-striya&#7717;.</span> <span class="Italic">Sura-str&#299;,</span> the women of the heavenly planets, were thus ordered to appear in the Yadu dynasty in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana to enrich the pastimes of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. These <span class="Italic">sura-str&#299;,</span> when further trained to live with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, would be transferred to the original Goloka V&#7771;nd&#257;vana. During Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s pastimes within this world, the <span class="Italic">sura-str&#299;</span> were to appear in different ways in different families to give pleasure to the Lord, just so that they would be fully trained before going to the eternal Goloka V&#7771;nd&#257;vana.

<div class="Translation">Since that time, the city of Mathur&#257; had been the capital of all the kings of the Yadu dynasty. The city and district of Mathur&#257; are very intimately connected with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, for Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a lives there eternally.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">It is understood that Mathur&#257; City is the transcendental abode of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a; it is not an ordinary material city, for it is eternally connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. V&#7771;nd&#257;vana is within the jurisdiction of Mathur&#257;, and it still continues to exist. Because Mathur&#257; and V&#7771;nd&#257;vana are intimately connected with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a eternally, it is said that Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a never leaves V&#7771;nd&#257;vana (<span class="Italic">v&#7771;nd&#257;vana&#7745; parityajya padam eka&#7745; na gacchati</span>). At present, the place known as V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, in the district of Mathur&#257;, continues its position as a transcendental place, and certainly anyone who goes there becomes transcendentally purified. Navadv&#299;pa-dh&#257;ma is also intimately connected with Vrajabh&#363;mi. &#346;r&#299;la Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura therefore says:</div>
<div class="Centered-Verse-in-purp">&#347;r&#299; gau&#7693;a-ma&#7751;&#7693;ala-bh&#363;mi,     yeb&#257; j&#257;ne cint&#257;ma&#7751;i,<br>t&#257;&rsquo;ra haya vrajabh&#363;me v&#257;sa</div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Vrajabh&#363;mi&rdquo; refers to Mathur&#257;-V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, and Gau&#7693;a-ma&#7751;&#7693;ala-bh&#363;mi includes Navadv&#299;pa. These two places are nondifferent. Therefore, anyone living in Navadv&#299;pa-dh&#257;ma, knowing K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu to be the same personality, lives in Vrajabh&#363;mi, Mathur&#257;-V&#7771;nd&#257;vana. The Lord has made it convenient for the conditioned soul to live in Mathur&#257;, V&#7771;nd&#257;vana and Navadv&#299;pa and thus be directly connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Simply by living in these places, one can immediately come in contact with the Lord. There are many devotees who vow never to leave V&#7771;nd&#257;vana and Mathur&#257;. This is undoubtedly a good vow, but if one leaves V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, Mathur&#257; or Navadv&#299;pa-dh&#257;ma for the service of the Lord, he is not disconnected from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. At any rate, we must understand the transcendental importance of Mathur&#257;-V&#7771;nd&#257;vana and Navadv&#299;pa-dh&#257;ma. Anyone who executes devotional service in these places certainly goes back home, back to Godhead, after giving up his body. Thus the words <span class="Italic">mathur&#257; bhagav&#257;n yatra nitya&#7745; sannihito hari&#7717;</span> are particularly important. A devotee should fully utilize this instruction to the best of his ability. Whenever the Supreme Lord personally appears, He appears in Mathur&#257; because of His intimate connection with this place. Therefore although Mathur&#257; and V&#7771;nd&#257;vana are situated on this planet earth, they are transcendental abodes of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation">Devak&#299;&rsquo;s father, King Devaka, was very much affectionate to his daughter. Therefore, while she and her husband were leaving home, he gave her a dowry of four hundred elephants nicely decorated with golden garlands. He also gave ten thousand horses, eighteen hundred chariots, and two hundred very beautiful young maidservants, fully decorated with ornaments.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The system of giving a dowry to one&rsquo;s daughter has existed in Vedic civilization for a very long time. Even today, following the same system, a father who has money will give his daughter an opulent dowry. A daughter would never inherit the property of her father, and therefore an affectionate father, during the marriage of his daughter, would give her as much as possible. A dowry, therefore, is never illegal according to the Vedic system. Here, of course, the gift offered as a dowry by Devaka to Devak&#299; was not ordinary. Because Devaka was a king, he gave a dowry quite suitable to his royal position. Even an ordinary man, especially a high-class <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a, k&#7779;atriya</span> or <span class="Italic">vai&#347;ya,</span> is supposed to give his daughter a liberal dowry. Immediately after the marriage, the daughter goes to her husband&rsquo;s house, and it is also a custom for the brother of the bride to accompany his sister and brother-in-law to exhibit affection for her. This system was followed by Ka&#7745;sa. These are all old customs in the society of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma,</span> which is now wrongly designated as Hindu. These long-standing customs are nicely described here.</div>

Before, he had been so affectionate that he was acting as his sister&rsquo;s chariot driver, but as soon as he heard that his self-interest or his life was at risk, he forgot all affection for her and immediately became a great enemy.

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.&rdquo; (Bg. <a href="indexf962.html?g=502">2.13</a>) A person or an animal is not the material body; rather, the material body is the covering of the living being. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> compares the body to a dress and elaborately explains how one changes dresses one after another. The same Vedic knowledge is confirmed here. The living being, the soul, is constantly changing bodies one after another. Even in the present life, the body changes from childhood to boyhood, from boyhood to youth, and from youth to old age; similarly, when the body is too old to continue, the living being gives up this body and, by the laws of nature, automatically gets another body according to his fruitive activities, desires and ambitions. The laws of nature control this sequence, and therefore as long as the living entity is under the control of the external, material energy, the process of bodily change takes place automatically, according to one&rsquo;s fruitive activities. Vasudeva therefore wanted to impress upon Ka&#7745;sa that if he committed this sinful act of killing a woman, in his next life he would certainly get a material body still more conditioned to the sufferings of material existence. Thus Vasudeva advised Ka&#7745;sa not to commit sinful activities.</div>
<div class="Purport">One who commits sinful activities because of ignorance, <span class="Italic">tamo-gu&#7751;a,</span> obtains a lower body. <span class="Italic">K&#257;ra&#7751;a&#7745; gu&#7751;a-sa&#7749;go &rsquo;sya sad-asad-yoni janmasu</span> (Bg. <a href="index4913.html?g=4477">13.22</a>). There are hundreds and thousands of different species of life. Why are there higher and lower bodies? One receives these bodies according to the contaminations of material nature. If in this life one is contaminated by the mode of ignorance and sinful activities (<span class="Italic">du&#7779;k&#7771;t&#299;</span>), in the next life, by the laws of nature, one will certainly get a body full of suffering. The laws of nature are not subservient to the whimsical desires of the conditioned soul.

<div class="First">This is the process of the soul&rsquo;s transmigration from one body to another. At the time of death, according to his mental condition, the living being is carried by the subtle body, consisting of mind, intelligence and ego, to another gross body. When higher authorities have decided what kind of gross body the living entity will have, he is forced to enter such a body, and thus he automatically gives up his previous body. Dull-minded persons who do not have the intelligence to understand this process of transmigration take for granted that when the gross body is finished, one&rsquo;s life is finished forever. Such persons have no brains with which to understand the process of transmigration. At the present moment there is great opposition to the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a movement, which is being called a &ldquo;brainwashing&rdquo; movement. But actually the so-called scientists, philosophers and other leaders in the Western countries have no brains at all. The Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a movement is trying to elevate such foolish persons by enlightening their intelligence so that they will take advantage of the human body. Unfortunately, because of gross ignorance, they regard the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a movement as a brainwashing movement. They do not know that without God consciousness one is forced to continue transmigrating from one body to another. Because of their devilish brains, they will next be forced to accept an abominable life and practically never be able to liberate themselves from the conditional life of material existence. How this transmigration of the soul takes place is very clearly explained in this verse.</div>

<div class="Translation">Having experienced a situation by seeing or hearing about it, one contemplates and speculates about that situation, and thus one surrenders to it, not considering his present body. Similarly, by mental adjustments one dreams at night of living under different circumstances, in different bodies, and forgets his actual position. Under this same process, one gives up his present body and accepts another [tath&#257; deh&#257;ntara-pr&#257;pti&#7717;].</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Transmigration of the soul is very clearly explained in this verse. One sometimes forgets his present body and thinks of his childhood body, a body of the past, and of how one was playing, jumping, talking and so on. When the material body is no long workable, it becomes dust: &ldquo;For dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.&rdquo; But when the body again mixes with the five material elements&mdash;earth, water, fire, air and ether&mdash;the mind continues to work. The mind is the subtle substance in which the body is created, as we actually experience in our dreams and also when we are awake in contemplation. One must understand that the process of mental speculation develops a new type of body that does not actually exist. If one can understand the nature of the mind (<span class="Italic">manorathena</span>) and its thinking, feeling and willing, one can very easily understand how from the mind different types of bodies develop.</div>
<div class="Purport">The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, therefore, offers a process of transcendental activities wherein the mind is fully absorbed in affairs pertaining to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The presence of the soul is perceived by consciousness, and one must purify his consciousness from material to spiritual, or, in other words, to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. That which is spiritual is eternal, and that which is material is temporary. Without K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, one&rsquo;s consciousness is always absorbed in temporary things.

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.&rdquo; One must learn the secret of success from the Vedic literatures, especially when the cream of Vedic knowledge is presented by <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as it is.</div>
<div class="Purport">Because the mind is ultimately controlled by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the word <span class="Italic">apasm&#7771;ti&#7717;</span> is significant. Forgetfulness of one&rsquo;s own identity is called <span class="Italic">apasm&#7771;ti&#7717;.</span> This <span class="Italic">apasm&#7771;ti&#7717;</span> can be controlled by the Supreme Lord, for the Lord says, <span class="Italic">matta&#7717; sm&#7771;tir j&ntilde;&#257;nam apohana&#7745; ca:</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a></I>]</I> &ldquo;From Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.&rdquo; Instead of allowing one to forget one&rsquo;s real position, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a can revive one&rsquo;s original identity at the time of one&rsquo;s death, even though the mind may be flickering. Although the mind may work imperfectly at the time of death, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a gives a devotee shelter at His lotus feet. Therefore when a devotee gives up his body, the mind does not take him to another material body (<span class="Italic">tyaktv&#257; deha&#7745; punar janma naiti m&#257;m eti</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexe89d.html?g=1505">4.9</a>]); rather, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a takes the devotee to that place where He is engaged in His pastimes (<span class="Italic">m&#257;m eti</span>), as we have already discussed in previous verses. One&rsquo;s consciousness, therefore, must always be absorbed in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and then one&rsquo;s life will be successful. Otherwise the mind will carry the soul to another material body. The soul will be placed in the semen of a father and discharged into the womb of a mother. The semen and ovum create a particular type of body according to the form of the father and mother, and when the body is mature, the soul emerges in that body and begins a new life. This is the process of transmigration of the soul from one body to another (<span class="Italic">tath&#257; deh&#257;ntara-pr&#257;pti&#7717;</span>). Unfortunately, those who are less intelligent think that when the body disappears, everything is finished. The entire world is being misled by such fools and rascals. But as stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexd7ba.html?g=565">2.20</a>), <span class="Italic">na hanyate hanyam&#257;ne &#347;ar&#299;re.</span> The soul does not die when the body is destroyed. Rather, the soul takes on another body.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">At the time of death, according to the thinking, feeling and willing of the mind, which is involved in fruitive activities, one receives a particular body. In other words, the body develops according to the activities of the mind. Changes of body are due to the flickering of the mind, for otherwise the soul could remain in its original, spiritual body.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">One can very easily understand that the mind is constantly flickering, changing in the quality of its thinking, feeling and willing. This is explained by Arjuna in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexd494.html?g=2338">6.34</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">ca&ntilde;cala&#7745; hi mana&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a<br>pram&#257;thi balavad d&#7771;&#7693;ham<br>tasy&#257;ha&#7745; nigraha&#7745; manye<br>v&#257;yor iva sudu&#7779;karam</div>
</div><A NAME="121272"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">The mind is <span class="Italic">ca&ntilde;cala,</span> flickering, and it changes very strongly. Therefore Arjuna admitted that controlling the mind is not at all possible; this would be as difficult as controlling the wind. For example, if one were in a boat moving according to the wind on a river or the sea, and the wind were uncontrollable, the tilting boat would be very much disturbed and extremely difficult to control. It might even capsize. Therefore, in the <span class="Italic">bhava-samudra,</span> the ocean of mental speculation and transmigration to different types of bodies, one must first control the mind.</div>
<div class="Purport">By regulative practice one can control the mind, and this is the purpose of the <span class="Italic">yoga</span> system (<span class="Italic">abhy&#257;sa-yoga-yuktena</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index4cd5.html?g=2805">8.8</a>]). But there is a chance of failure with the <span class="Italic">yoga</span> system, especially in this age of Kali, because the <span class="Italic">yoga</span> system uses artificial means. If the mind is engaged in <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> however, by the grace of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a one can very easily control it. Therefore &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu has recommended, <span class="Italic">harer n&#257;ma harer n&#257;ma harer n&#257;maiva kevalam</I></span> [Adi </I><a href="indexd751.html?g=93741">17.21</a></I>]</I><span class="Italic">.</span> One should chant the holy name of the Lord constantly, for the holy name of the Lord is nondifferent from Hari, the Supreme Person.</div>
<div class="Purport">By chanting the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra</span> constantly, one can fix the mind on the lotus feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (<span class="Italic">sa vai mana&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-pad&#257;ravindayo&#7717;</span>) and in this way achieve the perfection of <span class="Italic">yoga.</span> Otherwise, the flickering mind will hover on the platform of mental speculation for sense enjoyment, and one will have to transmigrate from one type of body to another because the mind is trained only in relation to the material elements, or, in other words, to sense gratification, which is false. <span class="Italic">M&#257;y&#257;-sukh&#257;ya bharam udvahato vim&#363;&#7693;h&#257;n</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="index65eb.html?g=57220">7.9.43</a>). Rascals (<span class="Italic">vim&#363;&#7693;h&#257;n</span>), being controlled by mental speculation, make huge arrangements by which to enjoy life temporarily, but they must give up the body at the time of death, when everything is taken away by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s external energy (<span class="Italic">m&#7771;tyu&#7717; sarva-hara&#347; c&#257;ham</span>). At that time, whatever one has created in this life is lost, and one must automatically accept a new body by the force of material nature. In this life one may have constructed a very tall skyscraper, but in the next life, because of one&rsquo;s mentality, one may have to accept a body like that of a cat, a dog, a tree or perhaps a demigod. Thus the body is offered by the laws of material nature. <span class="Italic">K&#257;ra&#7751;a&#7745; gu&#7751;a-sa&#7749;go &rsquo;sya sad-asad-yoni janmasu</span> (Bg. <a href="index4913.html?g=4477">13.22</a>). The spirit soul takes birth in higher and lower species of life only because of his association with the three qualities of material nature.</div>

<div class="Purport">In conclusion, the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement offers the topmost welfare activity for human society. The saner section of human society must therefore take this movement very seriously for the benefit of all humanity.

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">When the luminaries in the sky, such as the moon, the sun and the stars, are reflected in liquids like oil or water, they appear to be of different shapes&mdash;sometimes round, sometimes long, and so on&mdash;because of the movements of the wind. Similarly, when the living entity, the soul, is absorbed in materialistic thoughts, he accepts various manifestations as his own identity because of ignorance. In other words, one is bewildered by mental concoctions because of agitation from the material modes of nature.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This verse gives a very good example by which to understand the different positions of the eternal spiritual soul in the material world and how the soul takes on different bodies (<span class="Italic">deh&#257;ntara-pr&#257;pti&#7717;</span>). The moon is stationary and is one, but when it is reflected in water or oil, it appears to take different shapes because of the movements of the wind. Similarly, the soul is the eternal servant of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but when put into the material modes of nature, it takes different bodies, sometimes as a demigod, sometimes a man, a dog, a tree and so on. By the influence of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> the illusory potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entity thinks that he is this person, that person, American, Indian, cat, dog, tree or whatever. This is called <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> When one is freed from this bewilderment and understands that the soul does not belong to any shape of this material world, one is situated on the spiritual platform (<span class="Italic">brahma-bh&#363;ta</span>).</div>
<div class="Purport">This realization is sometimes explained as <span class="Italic">nir&#257;k&#257;ra,</span> or formlessness. This formlessness, however, does not mean that the soul has no form. The soul has form, but the external, agitating form he has acquired because of material contamination is false. Similarly, God is also described as <span class="Italic">nir&#257;k&#257;ra,</span> which means that God has no material form but is <span class="Italic">sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha</span><I> <span class="Italic"></I>[</I>Bs. </span>5.1</I>]<span class="Italic"></I>.</span> The living entity is part and parcel of the supreme <span class="Italic">sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha,</span> but his material forms are temporary, or illusory. Both the living entity and the Supreme Lord have original, spiritual forms (<span class="Italic">sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha</span>), but the Lord, the Supreme, does not change His form. The Lord appears as He is, whereas the living entity appears because material nature forces him to accept different forms. When the living entity receives these different forms, he identifies with them, and not with his original, spiritual form. As soon as the living entity returns to his original, spiritual form and understanding, he immediately surrenders to the supreme form, the Personality of Godhead. This is explained in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index4112.html?g=2631">7.19</a>). <span class="Italic">Bah&#363;n&#257;&#7745; janman&#257;m ante j&ntilde;&#257;nav&#257;n m&#257;&#7745; prapadyate.</span> When the living entity, after many, many births in different forms, returns to his original form of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, he immediately surrenders unto the lotus feet of the supreme form, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. This is liberation. As the Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexc2a1.html?g=5889">18.54</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">brahma-bh&#363;ta&#7717; prasann&#257;tm&#257;<br>na &#347;ocati na k&#257;&#7749;k&#7779;ati<br>sama&#7717; sarve&#7779;u bh&#363;te&#7779;u<br>mad-bhakti&#7745; labhate par&#257;m</div>
</div><A NAME="121293"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me.&rdquo; Surrender unto the supreme form is the result of <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> This <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> or understanding of one&rsquo;s own position, is the complete liberation. As long as one is under an impersonal understanding of the Absolute Truth, he is not in pure knowledge, but must still struggle for pure knowledge. <span class="Italic">Kle&#347;o &rsquo;dhikataras te&#7779;&#257;m avyakt&#257;sakta-cetas&#257;m</span> (Bg. <a href="index3958.html?g=4186">12.5</a>). Although one may be spiritually advanced, if one is attached to the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth one must still work very hard, as indicated by the words <span class="Italic">kle&#347;o &rsquo;dhikatara&#7717;,</span> which mean &ldquo;greater suffering.&rdquo; A devotee, however, easily attains his original position as a spiritual form and understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His original form.</div>
<div class="Purport">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself explains the forms of the living entities in the Second Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> where He clearly says to Arjuna that He, Arjuna and all other living entities, who were previously in their original forms, are separate individual identities. They were individuals in the past, they are now situated in individuality, and in the future they will all continue to maintain their individual forms. The only difference is that the conditioned living entity appears in various material forms, whereas K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appears in His original, spiritual form. Unfortunately, those who are not advanced in spiritual knowledge think that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is like one of them and that His form is like their material forms. <span class="Italic">Avaj&#257;nanti m&#257;&#7745; m&#363;&#7693;h&#257; m&#257;nu&#7779;&#299;&#7745; tanum &#257;&#347;ritam</span> (Bg. <a href="indexa12b.html?g=3084">9.11</a>). K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is never puffed up by material knowledge and is therefore called <span class="Italic">acyuta,</span> whereas the living entities fall down and are agitated by material nature. This is the difference between the Supreme Lord and the living entities.</div>
<div class="Purport">In this connection it is to be noted that Vasudeva, who was situated in a transcendental position, advised Ka&#7745;sa not to commit further sinful activities. Ka&#7745;sa, a representative of the demons, was always ready to kill K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, or God, whereas Vasudeva represents a transcendentally situated person to whom K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is born (V&#257;sudeva is the son of Vasudeva). Vasudeva wanted his brother-in-law Ka&#7745;sa to refrain from the sinful act of killing his sister, since the result of being agitated by material nature would be that Ka&#7745;sa would have to accept a body in which to suffer again and again. Elsewhere in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="index404a.html?g=42765">5.5.4</a>), &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva also says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">na s&#257;dhu manye yata &#257;tmano &rsquo;yam<br>asann api kle&#347;ada &#257;sa deha&#7717;</div>
</div><A NAME="121297"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">As long as the living entity is entangled in the fruitive activities of so-called happiness and distress, he will receive a particular type of body in which to endure the three kinds of suffering due to material nature (<span class="Italic">tri-t&#257;pa-yantra&#7751;&#257;</span>). An intelligent person, therefore, must free himself from the influence of the three modes of material nature and revive his original, spiritual body by engaging in the service of the Supreme Person, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. As long as one is materially attached, one must accept the process of birth, death, old age and disease. One is therefore advised that an intelligent person, instead of being entangled in so-called good and bad fruitive activities, should engage his life in advancing in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness so that instead of accepting another material body (<span class="Italic">tyaktv&#257; deha&#7745; punar janma naiti</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexe89d.html?g=1505">4.9</a>]), he will return home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="First">Since the eighth son of Devak&#299; was to kill Ka&#7745;sa, one might ask what the need was for Vasudeva to deliver the first-born child.

Ka&#7745;sa, being an <span class="Italic">asura,</span> did not believe that the eighth child would kill him; he took it for granted that he might be killed by any of the children of Devak&#299;. Vasudeva, therefore, to save Devak&#299;, promised to give Ka&#7745;sa every child, whether male or female. From another point of view, Vasudeva and Devak&#299; were very pleased when they understood that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, would come as their eighth son. Vasudeva, a pure devotee of the Lord, was eager to see K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appear as his child from the eighth pregnancy of Devak&#299;. Therefore he wanted to deliver all the children quickly so that the eighth turn would come and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a would appear.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The word <span class="Italic">samatvam</span> is very significant in this verse. <span class="Italic">Samatvam</span> refers to one who is always equipoised, unaffected by either happiness or distress. Vasudeva was so steadily equipoised that he did not seem in the least agitated when delivering his first-born child into the hands of Ka&#7745;sa to be killed. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index9ace.html?g=886">2.56</a>) it is said, <span class="Italic">du&#7717;khe&#7779;v anudvigna-man&#257;&#7717; sukhe&#7779;u vigata-sp&#7771;ha&#7717;.</span> In the material world, one should not be very eager to be happy, nor should one be very much disturbed by material distress.

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;O son of Kunt&#299;, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons.

Even those who externally helped the activities of Ka&#7745;sa belonged to the higher planetary systems. The imprisonment and release of Vasudeva and the killing of various demons were all manifestations of the pastimes of the Lord, and because the devotees would be pleased to see these activities personally, they were all invited to take birth as friends and relatives of these families.

<div class="Translation">Once the great saint N&#257;rada approached Ka&#7745;sa and informed him of how the demoniac persons who were a great burden on the earth were going to be killed. Thus Ka&#7745;sa was placed into great fear and doubt.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">It has already been discussed that mother earth implored Lord Brahm&#257; to give her relief from the distress created by the burdensome demons and that Lord Brahm&#257; informed her that Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself was going to appear. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexb53f.html?g=1496">4.8</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">paritr&#257;&#7751;&#257;ya s&#257;dh&#363;n&#257;&#7745;<br>vin&#257;&#347;&#257;ya ca du&#7779;k&#7771;t&#257;m<br>dharma-sa&#7745;sth&#257;pan&#257;rth&#257;ya<br>sambhav&#257;mi yuge yuge</div>

<div class="After-Verse">Whenever there is a burden created by the demons and whenever the innocent devotees are distressed by demoniac rulers, the Lord appears in due course of time to kill the demons with the assistance of His real representatives, who are technically called demigods. In the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads</span> it is stated that the demigods are different parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As it is the duty of the parts of the body to serve the whole, it is the duty of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s devotees to serve K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as He wants. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s business is to kill the demons, and therefore this should be a devotee&rsquo;s business also. Because the people of Kali-yuga are fallen, however, &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, out of kindness for them, did not bring any weapon to kill them. Rather, by spreading K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, love of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, He wanted to kill their nefarious, demoniac activities. This is the purpose of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement. Unless the demoniac activities on the surface of the world are diminished or vanquished, no one can be happy. The program for the conditioned soul is fully described in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> and one simply has to follow these instructions to become happy. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu has therefore prescribed:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">harer n&#257;ma harer n&#257;ma<br>harer n&#257;maiva kevalam<br>kalau n&#257;sty eva n&#257;sty eva<br>n&#257;sty eva gatir anyath&#257;<br></I> [Adi </I><a href="indexd751.html?g=93741">17.21</a></I>]</I></div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">After the departure of the great saint N&#257;rada, Ka&#7745;sa thought that all the members of the Yadu dynasty were demigods and that any of the children born from the womb of Devak&#299; might be Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Fearing his death, Ka&#7745;sa arrested Vasudeva and Devak&#299; and chained them with iron shackles. Suspecting each of the children to be Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, Ka&#7745;sa killed them one after another because of the prophecy that Vi&#7779;&#7751;u would kill him.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">&#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;, in his notes on this verse, has mentioned how N&#257;rada Muni gave Ka&#7745;sa this information. This incident is described in the <span class="Italic">Hari-va&#7745;&#347;a.</span> N&#257;rada Muni went to see Ka&#7745;sa by providence, and Ka&#7745;sa received him very well. N&#257;rada, therefore, informed him that any one of the sons of Devak&#299; might be Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Because Vi&#7779;&#7751;u was to kill him, Ka&#7745;sa should not spare any of Devak&#299;&rsquo;s children, N&#257;rada Muni advised. N&#257;rada&rsquo;s intention was that Ka&#7745;sa, by killing the children, would increase his sinful activities so that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a would soon appear to kill him. Upon receiving the instructions of N&#257;rada Muni, Ka&#7745;sa killed all the children of Devak&#299; one after another.</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">ajana-&#347;a&#7749;kay&#257;</span> indicates that Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u never takes birth (<span class="Italic">ajana</span>) and that He therefore appeared as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, taking birth just like a human being (<span class="Italic">m&#257;nu&#7779;&#299;&#7745; tanum &#257;&#347;ritam</span>). Ka&#7745;sa attempted to kill all the babies born of Devak&#299; and Vasudeva, although he knew that if Vi&#7779;&#7751;u were born, He would not be killed. Actually it came to pass that when Vi&#7779;&#7751;u appeared as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Ka&#7745;sa could not kill Him; rather, as foretold, it was He who killed Ka&#7745;sa. One should know in truth how K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who takes His birth transcendentally, acts to kill the demons but is never killed. When one perfectly understands K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in this way, through the medium of <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra,</span> one becomes immortal.

<div class="First">We have seen in the history of India that Aurangzeb killed his brother and nephews and imprisoned his father to fulfill political ambitions. There have been many similar instances, and Ka&#7745;sa was the same type of king. Ka&#7745;sa did not hesitate to kill his nephews and imprison his sister and his father. For demons to do such things is not astonishing. Nonetheless, although Ka&#7745;sa was a demon, he was aware that Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u cannot be killed, and thus he attained salvation. Even partial understanding of the activities of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u makes one eligible for salvation. Ka&#7745;sa knew a little about K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&mdash;that He could not be killed&mdash;and therefore he attained salvation although he thought of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, as an enemy.

</div><A NAME="121617"></A>
<div class="Purport">Regarding transmigration of the soul, &#346;r&#299;la Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya gives the following notes. When one is awake, whatever one sees or hears is impressed upon the mind, which later works in dreams to show one different experiences, although in dreams one appears to accept a different body. For example, when one is awake one does business and talks with customers, and similarly in dreams one meets various customers, talks about business and gives quotations. Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya says, therefore, that dreams take place according to what one sees, hears and remembers. When one reawakens, of course, one forgets the body of the dream. This forgetfulness is called <span class="Italic">apasm&#7771;ti.</span> Thus we are changing bodies because we are sometimes dreaming, sometimes awake and sometimes forgetful. Forgetfulness of our previously created body is called death, and our work in the present body is called life. After death, one cannot remember the activities of one&rsquo;s previous body, whether imaginary or factual.</div>
<div class="Purport">The agitated mind is compared to agitated water reflecting the sun and the moon. Actually the sun and moon reflected on the water do not exist there; nonetheless, they are reflected according to the movements of the water. Similarly, when our minds are agitated, we wander in different material atmospheres and receive different types of bodies. This is described in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as <span class="Italic">gu&#7751;a-sa&#7749;ga.</span> <span class="Italic">K&#257;ra&#7751;a&#7745; gu&#7751;a-sa&#7749;go &rsquo;sya.</span> Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya says, <span class="Italic">gu&#7751;a-nubaddha&#7717; san.</span> And &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu says, <span class="Italic">brahm&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a bhramite kona bh&#257;gyav&#257;n j&#299;va</span> (Cc. <span class="Ref_Italic">Madhya</span> <a href="index9884.html?g=124149">19.151</a>). The living entity rotates up and down throughout the universe, sometimes in the upper planetary system, sometimes in the middle and lower planetary systems, sometimes as a man, sometimes a god, a dog, a tree and so on. This is all due to the agitation of the mind. The mind must therefore be steadily fixed. As it is said, <span class="Italic">sa vai mana&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-pad&#257;ravindayo&#7717;.</span> One should fix one&rsquo;s mind at the lotus feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and then one will become free from agitation. This is the instruction of the <span class="Italic">Garu&#7693;a Pur&#257;&#7751;a,</span> and in the <span class="Italic">N&#257;rad&#299;ya Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> the same process is described. As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> <span class="Italic">y&#257;nti deva-vrat&#257; dev&#257;n </I>[Bg. </I><a href="index0567.html?g=3210">9.25</a></I>]</I>.</span> The agitated mind goes to different planetary systems because it is attached to different kinds of demigods, but one does not go to the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by worshiping the demigods, for this is not supported by any Vedic literature. Man is the architect of his own fortune. In this human life one has the facility with which to understand one&rsquo;s real situation, and one can decide whether to wander around the universe forever or return home, back to Godhead. This is also confirmed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">apr&#257;pya m&#257;&#7745; nivartante m&#7771;tyu-sa&#7745;s&#257;ra-vartmani</span>).</div>
<div class="Purport">There is no such thing as chance. When a tree is burning in a forest fire and although the nearest tree is spared a distant tree catches fire, this may appear to be chance. Similarly, one may seem to get different types of bodies by chance, but actually one receives these bodies because of the mind. The mind flickers between accepting and rejecting, and according to the acceptance and rejection of the mind, we receive different types of bodies, although we superficially seem to obtain these bodies by chance. Even if we accept the theory of chance, the immediate cause for the change of body is the agitation of the mind.</div>
<div class="Purport">Notes on <span class="Italic">a&#7745;&#347;a.</span> This chapter describes that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appeared <span class="Italic">a&#7745;&#347;ena,</span> with His parts and parcels or His partial manifestation. In this connection, &#346;r&#299;dhara Sv&#257;m&#299; says that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is one hundred percent Bhagav&#257;n (<span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;as tu bhagav&#257;n svayam</span>). Because of our imperfections, however, we cannot appreciate K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in fullness, and therefore whatever K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a exhibited when present on earth was but a partial manifestation of His opulence. Again, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appeared with His plenary expansion Baladeva. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, however, is full; there is no question of His appearing partially. In the <span class="Italic">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-to&#7779;a&#7751;&#299;,</span> &#346;r&#299;la San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299; says that to accept that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was partially manifested would contradict the statement <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;as tu bhagav&#257;n svayam.</span> &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; says that the word <span class="Italic">a&#7745;&#347;ena</span> means that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appeared with all His plenary expansions. The words <span class="Italic">a&#7745;&#347;ena vi&#7779;&#7751;o&#7717;</span> do not mean that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is a partial representative of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Rather, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appeared in fullness, and He manifests Himself partially in the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;halokas. In other words, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is a partial representation of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is not a partial representation of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. In the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta, &#256;di-l&#299;l&#257;,</span> Chapter Four, this subject matter is explained very clearly. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura also notes that no one can describe K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in fullness. Whatever descriptions we find in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> are partial explanations of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. In conclusion, therefore, the word <span class="Italic">a&#7745;&#347;ena</span> indicates that Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is a partial representation of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, not that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is a partial representation of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u.</div>
<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299;la San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299;&rsquo;s <span class="Italic">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-to&#7779;a&#7751;&#299;</span> has explained the word <span class="Italic">dharma-&#347;&#299;lasya.</span> The exact meaning of <span class="Italic">dharma-&#347;&#299;la</span> is &ldquo;an unadulterated devotee.&rdquo; Real <span class="Italic">dharma</span> consists of full surrender to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (<span class="Italic">sarva-dharm&#257;n parityajya m&#257;m eka&#7745; &#347;ara&#7751;a&#7745; vraja</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="index3a32.html?g=5997">18.66</a>]). One who has fully surrendered to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is actually religious. One such religious person was Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it. Anyone who accepts the principle of surrender to the lotus feet of the Lord, giving up all other systems of religion, is actually <span class="Italic">dharma-&#347;&#299;la,</span> perfectly religious.</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">niv&#7771;tta-tar&#7779;ai&#7717;</span> refers to one who no longer has any material desires (<span class="Italic">sarvop&#257;dhi-vinirmuktam</span></I> [Cc. Madhya </I><a href="index663c.html?g=124289">19.170</a></I>]</I>). One may have many material desires because of contamination in this material world, but when one is completely free from all material desires, he is called <span class="Italic">niv&#7771;tta-t&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a,</span> which indicates that he no longer has any thirst for material enjoyment. <span class="Italic">Sv&#257;min k&#7771;t&#257;rtho &rsquo;smi vara&#7745; na y&#257;ce</span> (<span class="Italic">Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya</span>). Materialistic persons want some material profit from executing devotional service, but this is not the purpose of service. The perfection of devotional service lies in complete surrender unto the lotus feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, with no material desires. One who surrenders in this way is already liberated. <span class="Italic">J&#299;van-mukta&#7717; sa ucyate.</span> One who is always busy serving K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, in whatever condition he may live, is understood to be liberated even in this life. Such a person, who is a pure devotee, does not need to change his body; indeed, he does not possess a material body, for his body has already been spiritualized. An iron rod kept constantly within a fire will ultimately become fire, and whatever it touches will burn. Similarly, the pure devotee is in the fire of spiritual existence, and therefore his body is <span class="Italic">cin-maya;</span> that is, it is spiritual, not material, because the pure devotee has no desire but the transcendental desire to serve the Lord. In text four the word <span class="Italic">upag&#299;yam&#257;n&#257;t</span> is used: <span class="Italic">niv&#7771;tta-tar&#7779;air upag&#299;yam&#257;n&#257;t.</span> Who will chant the glories of the Lord unless he is a devotee? Therefore the word <span class="Italic">niv&#7771;tta-tar&#7779;ai&#7717;</span> indicates the devotee, and no one else. These are the remarks of <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> like V&#299;rar&#257;ghava &#256;c&#257;rya and Vijayadhvaja. To desire anything other than devotional service will diminish one&rsquo;s freedom from material desires, but when one is free from all such desires one is called <span class="Italic">niv&#7771;tta-tar&#7779;ai&#7717;.</span></div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Vin&#257; pa&#347;u-ghn&#257;t.</span> The word <span class="Italic">pa&#347;u</span> means &ldquo;animal.&rdquo; An animal killer, <span class="Italic">pa&#347;u-ghna,</span> cannot enter into K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. In our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, therefore, animal killing is completely prohibited.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Uttama&#347;loka-gu&#7751;&#257;nuv&#257;d&#257;t.</span> The word <span class="Italic">uttama&#347;loka</span> means &ldquo;one who is famous as the best of those who are good.&rdquo; The Lord is good in all circumstances. That is His natural reputation. His goodness is unlimited, and He uses it unlimitedly. A devotee is also sometimes described as <span class="Italic">uttama&#347;loka,</span> meaning that he is eager to glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead or the Lord&rsquo;s devotees. Glorifying the Lord and glorifying the Lord&rsquo;s devotees are the same. Or, rather, glorifying the devotee is more important than glorifying the Lord directly. Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura explains this fact: <span class="Italic">ch&#257;&#7693;iy&#257; vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-sev&#257;, nist&#257;ra p&#257;yeche keb&#257;.</span> One cannot be liberated from material contamination without sincerely serving a devotee of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Bhavau&#7779;adh&#257;t</span> means &ldquo;from the universal remedy.&rdquo; Chanting the holy name and glorifying the Supreme Lord are the universal remedy for all the miseries of materialistic life. Persons who desire to be freed from this material world are called <span class="Italic">mumuk&#7779;u.</span> Such persons can understand the miseries of materialistic life, and by glorifying the activities of the Lord they can be released from all these miseries. The transcendental sound vibrations concerning the Lord&rsquo;s name, fame, form, qualities and paraphernalia are all nondifferent from the Lord. Therefore the very sound vibration of the Lord&rsquo;s glorification and name are pleasing to the ears, and by understanding the absolute nature of the Lord&rsquo;s name, form and qualities the devotee becomes joyful. Even those who are not devotees, however, enjoy the pleasing narrations of the Lord&rsquo;s transcendental activities. Even ordinary persons not very much advanced in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness take pleasure in describing the narrations depicted in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> When a materialistic person is purified in this way, he engages in hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord. Because glorification of the Lord&rsquo;s pastimes is very pleasing to the ear and heart of the devotee, it is simultaneously his subject and object.</div>
<div class="Purport">In this world there are three kinds of men: those who are liberated, those trying to be liberated, and those entangled in sense enjoyment. Of these three, those who are already liberated chant and hear the holy name of the Lord, knowing perfectly that to glorify the Lord is the only way to keep oneself in a transcendental position. Those who are trying to be liberated, the second class, may regard the chanting and hearing of the Lord&rsquo;s holy name as a process of liberation, and they too will feel the transcendental pleasure of this chanting. As for <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> and persons engaged in sense gratification, they also may take pleasure in hearing the pastimes of the Lord, like His fighting on the Battlefield of Kuruk&#7779;etra and His dancing in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana with the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">uttama&#347;loka-gu&#7751;&#257;nuv&#257;da</span> refers to the transcendental qualities of the Supreme Lord, such as His affection for mother Ya&#347;od&#257; and His friends the cowherd boys and His loving attitude toward the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s.</span> The Lord&rsquo;s devotees like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira are also described by the qualification <span class="Italic">uttama&#347;loka-gu&#7751;&#257;nuv&#257;da.</span> The word <span class="Italic">anuv&#257;da</span> refers to describing the qualities of the Supreme Lord or His devotees. When these qualities are described, other devotees are interested in hearing them. The more one is interested in hearing about these transcendental qualities, the more one transcendentally enjoys. Everyone, therefore, including the <span class="Italic">mumuk&#7779;us,</span> the <span class="Italic">vimuktas</span> and the <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s,</span> should chant and hear the glories of the Lord, and in this way everyone will benefit.</div>
<div class="Purport">Although the sound vibration of the transcendental qualities of the Lord is equally beneficial to all, for those who are <span class="Italic">muktas,</span> liberated, it is especially pleasing. As described in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> Eighth Canto, Third Chapter, verse twenty, because pure devotees, who no longer have any material desires, surrender fully to the lotus feet of the Lord, they always merge in the ocean of bliss by chanting and hearing the Lord&rsquo;s holy name. According to this verse, devotees like N&#257;rada and other residents of &#346;vetadv&#299;pa are seen always engaged in chanting the holy name of the Lord because by such chanting they are always externally and internally blissful. The <span class="Italic">mumuk&#7779;us,</span> persons desiring to be liberated, do not depend on the pleasures of the senses; instead, they concentrate fully on becoming liberated by chanting the holy name of the Lord. <span class="Italic">Karm&#299;s</span> like to create something pleasing to their ears and hearts, and although they sometimes like to chant or hear the glories of the Lord, they do not do it openly. Devotees, however, always spontaneously hear, chant about and remember the activities of the Lord, and by this process they are fully satisfied, even though these may seem like topics of sense gratification. Simply by hearing the transcendental narrations of the Lord&rsquo;s activities, Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was liberated. He was therefore <span class="Italic">&#347;rotramano-&rsquo;bhir&#257;ma;</span> that is, he glorified the process of hearing. This process should be accepted by all living entities.</div>
<div class="Purport">To distinguish persons who are bereft of these transcendental pleasures, Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja has used the words <span class="Italic">virajyeta pum&#257;n.</span> The word <span class="Italic">pum&#257;n</span> refers to any person, whether man, woman or in-between. Because of the bodily conception of life, we are subject to lamentation, but one who has no such bodily conceptions can take pleasure in transcendental hearing and chanting. Therefore a person fully absorbed in the bodily concept of life is surely killing himself by not making spiritual progress. Such a person is called <span class="Italic">pa&#347;u-ghna.</span> Especially excluded from spiritual life are the animal hunters, who are not interested in hearing and chanting the holy name of the Lord. Such hunters are always unhappy, both in this life and in the next. It is therefore said that a hunter should neither die nor live because for such persons both living and dying are troublesome. Animal hunters are completely different from ordinary <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s,</span> and thus they have been excluded from the process of hearing and chanting. <span class="Italic">Vin&#257; pa&#347;u-ghn&#257;t.</span> They cannot enter into the transcendental pleasure of chanting and hearing the holy name of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-ratha</span> refers to a great hero who can fight alone against eleven thousand other heroes, and the word <span class="Italic">atiratha,</span> as found in text five, refers to one who can fight against an unlimited number. This is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> as follows:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">ek&#257;da&#347;a-sahasr&#257;&#7751;i<br>yodhayed yas tu dhanvin&#257;m<br>astra-&#347;astra-prav&#299;&#7751;a&#347; ca<br>mah&#257;-ratha iti sm&#7771;ta&#7717;<br>amit&#257;n yodhayed yas tu<br>samprokto &rsquo;tirathas tu sa&#7717;</div>
</div><A NAME="121632"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">This is the description given in the <span class="Italic">B&#7771;had-vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-to&#7779;a&#7751;&#299;</span> by &#346;r&#299;la San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299;.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Ref_Italic">M&#257;y&#257;-manu&#7779;yasya</span> (10.1.17). Because of being covered by <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">n&#257;ha&#7745; prak&#257;&#347;a&#7717; sarvasya yogam&#257;y&#257;-sam&#257;v&#7771;ta&#7717;</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="index109a.html?g=2685">7.25</a></I>]</I>), K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is sometimes called <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;-manu&#7779;ya,</span> indicating that although He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He appears like an ordinary person. A misunderstanding arises because <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;</span> covers the vision of the general public. The Lord&rsquo;s position is actually different from that of an ordinary person, for although He appears to act like an ordinary man, He is always transcendental. The word <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> also indicates &ldquo;mercy,&rdquo; and sometimes it also means &ldquo;knowledge.&rdquo; The Lord is always full of all transcendental knowledge, and therefore although He acts like a human being, He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, full of knowledge. In His original identity, the Lord is the controller of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">may&#257;dhyak&#7779;e&#7751;a prak&#7771;ti&#7717; s&#363;yate sa-car&#257;caram</I> [Bg. </I><a href="index652d.html?g=3075">9.10</a></I>]</I></span>). Therefore the Lord may be called <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;-manu&#7779;ya,</span> or the Supreme Personality of Godhead playing like an ordinary human being, although He is the controller of both the material and spiritual energies. The Lord is the Supreme Person, Puru&#7779;ottama, but because we are deluded by <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;,</span> He appears to be an ordinary person. Ultimately, however, <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;</span> induces even a nondevotee to understand the Lord as the Supreme Person, Puru&#7779;ottama. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> we find two statements given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For the devotees, the Lord says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">te&#7779;&#257;&#7745; satata-yukt&#257;n&#257;&#7745;<br>bhajat&#257;&#7745; pr&#299;ti-p&#363;rvakam<br>dad&#257;mi buddhi-yoga&#7745; ta&#7745;<br>yena m&#257;m upay&#257;nti te</div>
</div><A NAME="121635"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.&rdquo; (Bg. <a href="index0c2e.html?g=3378">10.10</a>) Thus for the willing devotee the Lord gives intelligence by which to understand Him and return home, back to Godhead. For others, for nondevotees, the Lord says, <span class="Italic">m&#7771;tyu&#7717; sarva-hara&#347; c&#257;ham:</span> &ldquo;I am all-plundering, inevitable death.&rdquo; A devotee like Prahl&#257;da enjoys the activities of Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva, whereas nondevotees like Prahl&#257;da&rsquo;s father, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, meet death before Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva. The Lord therefore acts in two ways, by sending some onto the path of repeated birth and death and sending others back home, back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">k&#257;la,</span> meaning &ldquo;black,&rdquo; indicates the color of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and Lord R&#257;macandra, who both look blackish, give liberation and transcendental bliss to Their devotees. Among persons possessing material bodies, sometimes someone is able to subject death to his own will. For such a person, death is almost impossible because no one wants to die. But although Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva possessed this power, Bh&#299;&#7779;ma, by the supreme will of the Lord, died very easily in the Lord&rsquo;s presence. There have also been many demons who had no hope of salvation, yet Ka&#7745;sa attained salvation by the supreme will of the Lord. Not to speak of Ka&#7745;sa, even P&#363;tan&#257; attained salvation and reached the level of the Lord&rsquo;s mother. Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, therefore, was very eager to hear about the Lord, who has inconceivable qualities by which to give liberation to anyone. Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, at the point of his death, was certainly interested in his liberation. When such a great and exalted personality as the Lord behaves like an ordinary human being although possessing inconceivable qualities, His behavior is called <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> Therefore the Lord is described as <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;-manu&#7779;ya.</span> This is the opinion of &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;. <span class="Italic">Mu</span> refers to <span class="Italic">mukti,</span> or salvation, and <span class="Italic">ku</span> refers to that which is bad or very obnoxious. Thus <span class="Italic">muku</span> refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who saves one from the bad condition of material existence. The Lord is called <span class="Italic">mukunda</span> because He not only saves the devotee from material existence but offers him transcendental bliss in love and service.</div>
<div class="Purport">As for Ke&#347;ava, <span class="Italic">ka</span> means Brahm&#257;, and <span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;a</span> means Lord &#346;iva. The personality of Godhead captivates both Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord Mah&#257;deva, or &#346;iva, by His transcendental qualities. Therefore He is called Ke&#347;ava. This opinion is given by San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299; in his <span class="Italic">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-to&#7779;a&#7751;&#299;</span> commentary.</div>
<div class="Purport">It is said that all the demigods, accompanied by Tri-nayana, Lord &#346;iva, went to the shore of the ocean of milk and offered their prayers through the <span class="Italic">mantra</span> known as <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a-s&#363;kta.</span> From this statement it is understood that the demigods cannot directly approach Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, who lies on the ocean of milk, or enter His abode. This is also clearly stated in the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, Mok&#7779;a-dharma,</span> and the next chapter of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has His abode in Goloka (<span class="Italic">goloka-n&#257;mni nija-dh&#257;mni tale ca tasya</I> [Bs. </span></I>5.43]). From Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a come the <span class="Italic">catur-vy&#363;ha,</span> the quadruple expansions Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a, Aniruddha, Pradyumna and V&#257;sudeva. There are innumerable <span class="Italic">brahm&#257;&#7751;&#7693;as,</span> all of which emanate from the pores of K&#257;ra&#7751;odaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and in every <span class="Italic">brahm&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</span> there is a Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, who is a partial expansion of Aniruddha. This Aniruddha is a partial expansion of Pradyumna, who is partially represented as K&#7779;&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Supersoul of all living entities. These Vi&#7779;&#7751;u expansions are different from K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who resides in Goloka V&#7771;nd&#257;vana. When it is said that the demigods offered prayers to the Lord by chanting the <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a-s&#363;kta,</span> this indicates that they pleased the Lord by enunciating prayers of <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">v&#7771;&#7779;&#257;kapi</span> refers to one who satisfies His devotee in every way and frees His devotee from all material anxieties. <span class="Italic">V&#7771;&#7779;a</span> refers to religious performances like sacrifices. Even without the execution of sacrifices, the Lord can still enjoy the supermost comforts of the heavenly planets. The statement that Puru&#7779;ottama, Jagann&#257;tha, would appear in the house of Vasudeva distinguishes the Supreme Personality of Godhead from ordinary persons. The statement that He personally appeared indicates that He did not send His plenary expansion. The word <span class="Italic">priy&#257;rtham</span> indicates that the Lord appeared to please Rukmi&#7751;&#299; and R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;&#7751;&#299;. <span class="Italic">Priy&#257;</span> means &ldquo;the most beloved.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">In the commentary of &#346;r&#299; V&#299;rar&#257;ghava &#256;c&#257;rya, the following extra verse is accepted after text twenty-three:</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;O demigods, even great sages, following the order of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, appeared in the forms of cows and calves to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead by delivering milk.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">R&#257;m&#257;nuj&#257;c&#257;rya sometimes accepts Baladeva as a <span class="Italic">&#347;akty&#257;ve&#347;a-avat&#257;ra,</span> but &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; has explained that Baladeva is an expansion of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and that a part of Baladeva is Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a. Although Baladeva is identical with Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a, He is the origin of Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a. Therefore the word <span class="Italic">svar&#257;&#7789;</span> has been used to indicate that Baladeva always exists in His own independence. The word <span class="Italic">svar&#257;&#7789;</span> also indicates that Baladeva is beyond the material conception of existence. <span class="Italic">M&#257;y&#257;</span> cannot attract Him, but because He is fully independent, He can appear by His spiritual potency wherever He likes. <span class="Italic">M&#257;y&#257;</span> is fully under the control of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Because the material potency and <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;</span> mingle in the Lord&rsquo;s appearance, they are described as <span class="Italic">ek&#257;na&#7745;&#347;&#257;.</span> Sometimes <span class="Italic">ek&#257;na&#7745;&#347;&#257;</span> is interpreted to mean &ldquo;without differentiation.&rdquo; Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a and &#346;e&#7779;a-n&#257;ga are identical. As stated by Yamun&#257;dev&#299;, &ldquo;O R&#257;ma, O great-armed master of the world, who have extended Yourself throughout the entire universe by one plenary expansion, it is not possible to understand You fully.&rdquo; Therefore <span class="Italic">ek&#257;&#7745;&#347;&#257;</span> refers to &#346;e&#7779;a-n&#257;ga. In other words, Baladeva, merely by His partial expansion, sustains the entire universe.</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">k&#257;ry&#257;rthe</span> refers to one who attracted the pregnancy of Devak&#299; and bewildered mother Ya&#347;od&#257;. These pastimes are very confidential. The Supreme Personality of Godhead ordered <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;</span> to bewilder His associates in His pastimes and bewilder demons like Ka&#7745;sa. As stated previously, <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;&#7745; sam&#257;di&#347;at.</span> To give service to the Lord, <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;</span> appeared along with <span class="Italic">mah&#257;m&#257;y&#257;.</span> <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;m&#257;y&#257;</span> refers to <span class="Italic">yay&#257; sammohita&#7745; jagat,</span> &ldquo;one who bewilders the entire material world.&rdquo; From this statement it is to be understood that <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;,</span> in her partial expansion, becomes <span class="Italic">mah&#257;m&#257;y&#257;</span> and bewilders the conditioned souls. In other words, the entire creation has two divisions&mdash;transcendental, or spiritual, and material. <span class="Italic">Yogam&#257;y&#257;</span> manages the spiritual world, and by her partial expansion as <span class="Italic">mah&#257;m&#257;y&#257;</span> she manages the material world. As stated in the <span class="Italic">N&#257;rada-pa&ntilde;car&#257;tra, mah&#257;m&#257;y&#257;</span> is a partial expansion of <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;.</span> The <span class="Italic">N&#257;rada-pa&ntilde;car&#257;tra</span> clearly states that the Supreme Personality has one potency, which is sometimes described as Durg&#257;. The <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> says, <span class="Italic">ch&#257;yeva yasya bhuvan&#257;ni bibharti durg&#257;</I> [Bs. </span></I>5.44]<span class="Italic">.</span> Durg&#257; is not different from <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;.</span> When one understands Durg&#257; properly, he is immediately liberated, for Durg&#257; is originally the spiritual potency, <span class="Italic">hl&#257;din&#299;-&#347;akti,</span> by whose mercy one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead very easily. <span class="Italic">R&#257;dh&#257; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-pra&#7751;aya-vik&#7771;tir hl&#257;din&#299;-&#347;aktir asm&#257;d</I> [Adi </I><a href="indexb42c.html?g=80425">1.5</a></I>]</I>.</span> The <span class="Italic">mah&#257;m&#257;y&#257;-&#347;akti,</span> however, is a covering of <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;,</span> and she is therefore called the covering potency. By this covering potency, the entire material world is bewildered (<span class="Italic">yay&#257; sammohita&#7745; jagat</span>). In conclusion, bewildering the conditioned souls and liberating the devotees are both functions belonging to <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;.</span> Transferring the pregnancy of Devak&#299; and keeping mother Ya&#347;od&#257; in deep sleep were both done by <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;;</span> <span class="Italic">mah&#257;m&#257;y&#257;</span> cannot act upon such devotees, for they are always liberated. But although it is not possible for <span class="Italic">mah&#257;m&#257;y&#257;</span> to control liberated souls or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, she did bewilder Ka&#7745;sa. The action of <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;</span> in presenting herself before Ka&#7745;sa was the action of <span class="Italic">mah&#257;m&#257;y&#257;,</span> not <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;.</span> <span class="Italic">Yogam&#257;y&#257;</span> cannot even see or touch such polluted persons as Ka&#7745;sa. In <span class="Italic">Ca&#7751;&#7693;&#299;,</span> in the <span class="Italic">M&#257;rka&#7751;&#7693;eya Pur&#257;&#7751;a,</span> Eleventh Chapter, Mah&#257;m&#257;y&#257; says, &ldquo;During the twenty-eighth <span class="Italic">yuga</span> in the period of Vaivasvata Manu, I shall take birth as the daughter of Ya&#347;od&#257; and be known as Vindhy&#257;cala-v&#257;sin&#299;.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">The distinction between the two <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;s&mdash;yogam&#257;y&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-m&#257;y&#257;</span>&mdash;is described as follows. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s <span class="Italic">r&#257;sa-l&#299;l&#257;</span> with the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> and the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span>&rsquo; bewilderment in respect to their husbands, fathers-in-law and other such relatives were arrangements of <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;</span> in which <span class="Italic">mah&#257;m&#257;y&#257;</span> had no influence. The <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> gives sufficient evidence of this when it clearly says, <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;m up&#257;&#347;rita&#7717;.</span> On the other hand, there were <span class="Italic">asuras</span> headed by &#346;&#257;lva and <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> like Duryodhana who were bereft of devotional service in spite of seeing K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s carrier Garu&#7693;a and the universal form, and who could not understand K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This was also bewilderment, but this bewilderment was due to <span class="Italic">mah&#257;m&#257;y&#257;.</span> Therefore it is to be concluded that the <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> which drags a person from the Supreme Personality of Godhead is called <span class="Italic">ja&#7693;am&#257;y&#257;,</span> and the <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> which acts on the transcendental platform is called <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;.</span> When Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was taken away by Varu&#7751;a, he saw K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s opulence, but nonetheless he thought of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as his son. Such feelings of parental love in the spiritual world are acts of <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;,</span> not of <span class="Italic">ja&#7693;am&#257;y&#257;,</span> or <span class="Italic">mah&#257;m&#257;y&#257;.</span> This is the opinion of &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura.</div>

This is noted by San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299; in his <span class="Italic">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-to&#7779;a&#7751;&#299;</span> commentary.</div>
<div class="Purport">In regard to Mathur&#257;, we find this quotation:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">mathyate tu jagat sarva&#7745;<br>brahma-j&ntilde;&#257;nena yena v&#257;<br>tat-s&#257;ra-bh&#363;ta&#7745; yad yasy&#257;&#7745;<br>mathur&#257; s&#257; nigadyate</div>

<div class="After-Verse">When a self-realized soul acts in his transcendental position, his situation is called Mathur&#257;. In other words, when one acts in the process of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> he may live anywhere, but actually he lives in Mathur&#257;, V&#7771;nd&#257;vana. Devotion to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the son of Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, is the essence of all knowledge, and wherever such knowledge is manifested is called Mathur&#257;. Also, when one establishes <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> excluding all other methods, one&rsquo;s situation is called Mathur&#257;. <span class="Italic">Yatra nitya&#7745; sannihito hari&#7717;:</span> the place where Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, lives eternally is called Mathur&#257;. The word <span class="Italic">nitya</span> indicates eternality. The Supreme Lord is eternal, and His abode is also eternal. <span class="Italic">Goloka eva nivasaty akhil&#257;tma-bh&#363;ta&#7717; </I>[</I>Bs. </span>5.37]<span class="Italic">.</span> Although the Lord is always stationed in His abode, Goloka V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, He is present everywhere in fullness. This means that when the Supreme Lord descends on the surface of the world, His original abode is not vacant, for He can remain in His original abode and simultaneously descend upon Mathur&#257;, V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, Ayodhy&#257; and other places. He does not need to descend, since He is already present there; He simply manifests Himself.</div>
<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; has addressed Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it as <span class="Italic">t&#257;ta,</span> or &ldquo;beloved son.&rdquo; This is due to parental love in the heart of &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;. Because K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was soon coming as the son of Vasudeva and Devak&#299;, out of parental affection &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; addressed Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it as <span class="Italic">t&#257;ta,</span> &ldquo;my dear son.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">In the <span class="Italic">Vi&#347;va-ko&#347;a</span> dictionary, the word <span class="Italic">garbha</span> is explained: <span class="Italic">garbho bhr&#363;&#7751;e arbhake kuk&#7779;&#257;v ity &#257;di.</span> When Ka&#7745;sa was about to kill Devak&#299;, Vasudeva wanted to dissuade him by the diplomacy of <span class="Italic">s&#257;ma</span> and <span class="Italic">bheda.</span> <span class="Italic">S&#257;ma</span> means &ldquo;pacifying.&rdquo; Vasudeva wanted to pacify Ka&#7745;sa by indicating relations, gain, welfare, identity and glorification. Reference to these five concerns constitutes <span class="Italic">s&#257;ma,</span> and Vasudeva&rsquo;s presentation of fear in two situations&mdash;in this life and the next&mdash;is called <span class="Italic">bheda.</span> Thus Vasudeva used both <span class="Italic">s&#257;ma</span> and <span class="Italic">bheda</span> to pacify Ka&#7745;sa. praising Ka&#7745;sa&rsquo;s qualifications was glorification, and praising him as a descendant of the <span class="Italic">bhoja-va&#7745;&#347;a</span> appealed to <span class="Italic">sambandha,</span> relationship. Speaking of &ldquo;your sister&rdquo; was an appeal to identity. Speaking about killing a woman raises questions about fame and welfare, and arousing fear of the sinful act of killing one&rsquo;s sister during her marriage ceremony is an aspect of <span class="Italic">bheda.</span> The Bhoja dynasty refers to those who were simply interested in sense gratification and were therefore not very aristocratic. Another meaning of <span class="Italic">bhoja</span> is &ldquo;fighting.&rdquo; These were indications of defamation for Ka&#7745;sa. When Vasudeva addressed Ka&#7745;sa as <span class="Italic">d&#299;na-vatsala,</span> this was excessive praise. Ka&#7745;sa would accept calves as a form of revenue from his poor constituents, and therefore he was called <span class="Italic">d&#299;na-vatsala.</span> Vasudeva knew very well that he could not by force rescue Devak&#299; from the imminent danger. Devak&#299; was actually the daughter of Ka&#7745;sa&rsquo;s uncle, and therefore she is described as <span class="Italic">suh&#7771;t,</span> meaning &ldquo;relative.&rdquo; It is stated that Ka&#7745;sa refrained from killing his close relation Devak&#299; because if he had killed her, a great fight would have ensued among the other members of the family. Ka&#7745;sa refrained from provoking this great danger of a family fight, for it would have caused many persons to lose their lives.</div>
<div class="Purport">Formerly an <span class="Italic">asura</span> named K&#257;lanemi had six sons, named Ha&#7745;sa, Suvikrama, Kr&#257;tha, Damana, Ripurmardana and Krodhahant&#257;. They were known as the <span class="Italic">&#7779;a&#7693;-garbhas,</span> or six <span class="Italic">garbhas,</span> and they were all equally powerful and expert in military affairs. These <span class="Italic">&#7779;a&#7693;-garbhas</span> gave up the association of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, their grandfather, and underwent great austerities to satisfy Lord Brahm&#257;, who, upon being satisfied, agreed to give them whatever benediction they might desire. When asked by Lord Brahm&#257; to state what they wanted, the <span class="Italic">&#7779;&#257;&#7693;-garbhas</span> replied, &ldquo;Dear Lord Brahm&#257;, if you want to give us a benediction, give us the blessing that we will not be killed by any demigod, <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-roga,</span> Yak&#7779;a, Gandharva-pati, Siddha, C&#257;ra&#7751;a or human being, nor by great sages who are perfect in their penances and austerities.&rdquo; Brahm&#257; understood their purpose and fulfilled their desire. But when Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu came to know of these events, he was very angry at his grandsons. &ldquo;You have given up my association and have gone to worship Lord Brahm&#257;,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and therefore I no longer have any affection for you. You have tried to save yourselves from the hands of the demigods, but I curse you in this way: Your father will take birth as Ka&#7745;sa and kill all of you because you will take birth as sons of Devak&#299;.&rdquo; Because of this curse, the grandsons of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu had to take birth from the womb of Devak&#299; and be killed by Ka&#7745;sa, although he was previously their father. This description is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Hari-va&#7745;&#347;a, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u-parva,</span> Second Chapter. According to the comments of the <span class="Italic">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-to&#7779;a&#7751;&#299;,</span> the son of Devak&#299; known as K&#299;rtim&#257;n was the third incarnation. In his first incarnation he was known as Smara and was the son of Mar&#299;ci, and later he became the son of K&#257;lanemi. This is mentioned in the histories.</div>

<div class="Purport">The great saint N&#257;rada descended from the heavenly planets to the forest of Mathur&#257; and sent his messenger to Ka&#7745;sa. When the messenger approached Ka&#7745;sa and informed him of N&#257;rada&rsquo;s arrival, Ka&#7745;sa, the leader of the <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> was very happy and immediately came out of his palace to receive N&#257;rada, who was as bright as the sun, as powerful as fire, and free from all tinges of sinful activities. Ka&#7745;sa accepted N&#257;rada as his guest, offered him respectful obeisances and gave him a golden seat, brilliant like the sun. N&#257;rada was a friend of the King of heaven, and thus he told Ka&#7745;sa, the son of Ugrasena, &ldquo;My dear hero, you have satisfied me with a proper reception, and therefore I shall tell you something secret and confidential. While I was coming here from Nandak&#257;nana through the Caitraratha forest, I saw a great meeting of the demigods, who followed me to Sumeru Parvata. We traveled through many holy places, and finally we saw the holy Ganges. While Lord Brahm&#257; was consulting the other demigods at the top of Sumeru Hill, I was also present with my stringed instrument, the <span class="Italic">v&#299;&#7751;&#257;.</span> I shall tell you confidentially that the meeting was held just to plan to kill the <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> headed by you.

<div class="Purport">No one can blame N&#257;radaj&#299; for encouraging Ka&#7745;sa to kill the sons of Devak&#299;. The saint N&#257;rada is always a well-wisher for human society, and he wanted the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, to descend to this world as soon as possible so that the society of demigods would be pleased and would see Ka&#7745;sa and his friends killed by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Ka&#7745;sa would also attain salvation from his nefarious activities, and this too would very much please the demigods and their followers. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura remarks in this connection that N&#257;rada Muni sometimes did things that were beneficial to the demigods and the demons simultaneously. &#346;r&#299; V&#299;rar&#257;ghava &#256;c&#257;rya, in his commentary, has included the following half-verse in this regard: <span class="Italic">asur&#257;&#7717; sarva evaita lokopadrava-k&#257;ri&#7751;a&#7717;.</span> <span class="Italic">Asuras</span> are always disturbing elements for human society.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Meanwhile, because of the Lord&rsquo;s presence within the womb of Devak&#299;, all the demigods came to offer the Lord their prayers. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, they said, is eternally the Absolute Truth. The spiritual soul is more important than the gross body, and the Supersoul, Param&#257;tm&#257;, is still more important than the soul. The Supreme Godhead is absolutely independent, and His incarnations are transcendental. The prayers of the demigods glorify and exalt devotees and explain the fate of persons who superficially consider themselves liberated from the conditions of material nature. A devotee is always safe. When a devotee fully surrenders at the lotus feet of the Lord, he is completely liberated from the fear of material existence.

<div class="Translation">Some of their relatives, however, began to follow Ka&#7745;sa&rsquo;s principles and act in his service. After Ka&#7745;sa, the son of Ugrasena, killed the six sons of Devak&#299;, a plenary portion of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a entered her womb as her seventh child, arousing her pleasure and her lamentation. That plenary portion is celebrated by great sages as Ananta, who belongs to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s second quadruple expansion.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Some of the chief devotees, such as Akr&#363;ra, stayed with Ka&#7745;sa to satisfy him. This they did for various purposes. They all expected the Supreme Personality of Godhead to appear as the eighth child as soon as Devak&#299;&rsquo;s other children were killed by Ka&#7745;sa, and they were eagerly awaiting His appearance. By remaining in Ka&#7745;sa&rsquo;s association, they would be able to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead take birth and display His childhood pastimes, and Akr&#363;ra would later go to V&#7771;nd&#257;vana to bring K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and Balar&#257;ma to Mathur&#257;. The word <span class="Italic">paryup&#257;sate</span> is significant because it indicates that some devotees wanted to stay near Ka&#7745;sa in order to see all these pastimes of the Lord. The six children killed by Ka&#7745;sa had formerly been sons of Mar&#299;ci, but because of having been cursed by a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> they were obliged to take birth as grandsons of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu. Ka&#7745;sa had taken birth as K&#257;lanemi, and now he was obliged to kill his own sons. This was a mystery. As soon as the sons of Devak&#299; were killed, they would return to their original place. The devotees wanted to see this also. Generally speaking, no one kills his own nephews, but Ka&#7745;sa was so cruel that he did so without hesitation. Ananta, Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a, belongs to the second <span class="Italic">catur-vy&#363;ha,</span> or quadruple expansion. This is the opinion of experienced commentators.</div>

A pure devotee is always fearful of material existence. No one knows what will happen next, for one may have to change his body at any moment (<span class="Italic">tath&#257; deh&#257;ntara-pr&#257;pti&#7717;</span>). Knowing this fact, a pure devotee acts in such a way that he will not have his life spoiled by being obliged to accept another body and undergo the tribulations of material existence.

This fear is due to material existence. Properly speaking, everyone should always be alert and fearful of material existence, but although everyone is prone to be affected by the ignorance of material existence, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, is always alert to the protection of His devotees. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is so kind and affectionate toward His devotees that He helps them by giving them the intelligence by which to exist in this material world without forgetting Him even for a moment.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The first plenary expansion of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is Baladeva, also known as &#346;e&#7779;a. The &#346;e&#7779;a incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead supports the entire universe, and the eternal mother of this incarnation is mother Rohi&#7751;&#299;. &ldquo;Because I am going into the womb of Devak&#299;,&rdquo; the Lord told Yogam&#257;y&#257;, &ldquo;the &#346;e&#7779;a incarnation has already gone there and made suitable arrangements so that I may live there. Now He should enter the womb of Rohi&#7751;&#299;, His eternal mother.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">In this connection, one may ask how the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is always situated transcendentally, could enter the womb of Devak&#299;, which had previously been entered by the six <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> the <span class="Italic">&#7779;a&#7693;-garbhas.</span> Does this mean that the <span class="Italic">&#7778;a&#7693;-garbh&#257;suras</span> were equal to the transcendental body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead? The following answer is given by &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura.</div>
<div class="Purport">The entire creation, as well as its individual parts, is an expansion of the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, even though the Lord enters the material world, He does not do so. This is explained by the Lord Himself in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexa3fb.html?g=3021">9.4</a>&ndash;5):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">may&#257; tatam ida&#7745; sarva&#7745;<br>jagad avyakta-m&#363;rtin&#257;<br>mat-sth&#257;ni sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;ni<br>na c&#257;ha&#7745; te&#7779;v avasthita&#7717;</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them. And yet everything that is created does not rest in Me. Behold My mystic opulence! Although I am the maintainer of all living entities, and although I am everywhere, My Self is the very source of creation.&rdquo; <span class="Italic">Sarva&#7745; khalv ida&#7745; brahma.</span> Everything is an expansion of Brahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, yet everything is not the Supreme Godhead, and He is not everywhere. Everything rests upon Him and yet does not rest upon Him. This can be explained only through the <span class="Italic">acintya-bhed&#257;bheda</span> philosophy. Such truths cannot be understood, however, unless one is a pure devotee, for the Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexbf7d.html?g=5898">18.55</a>), <span class="Italic">bhakty&#257; m&#257;m abhij&#257;n&#257;ti y&#257;v&#257;n ya&#347; c&#257;smi tattvata&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service.&rdquo; Even though the Lord cannot be understood by ordinary persons, this principle should be understood from the statement of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">A pure devotee is always transcendentally situated because of executing nine different processes of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> (<span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;a&#7745; k&#299;rtana&#7745; vi&#7779;&#7751;o&#7717; smarana&#7745; p&#257;da-sevanam/ arcana&#7745; vandana&#7745; d&#257;sya&#7745; sakhyam &#257;tma-nivedanam </I>[SB </span></I><a href="indexda76.html?g=55355">7.5.23</a>]). Thus situated in devotional service, a devotee, although in the material world, is not in the material world. Yet a devotee always fears, &ldquo;Because I am associated with the material world, so many contaminations affect me.&rdquo; Therefore he is always alert in fear, which gradually diminishes his material association.</div>
<div class="Purport">Symbolically, mother Devak&#299;&rsquo;s constant fear of Ka&#7745;sa was purifying her. A pure devotee should always fear material association, and in this way all the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> of material association will be killed, as the <span class="Italic">&#7779;a&#7693;-garbh&#257;suras</span> were killed by Ka&#7745;sa. It is said that from the mind, Mar&#299;ci appears. In other words, Mar&#299;ci is an incarnation of the mind. Mar&#299;ci has six sons: K&#257;ma, Krodha, Lobha, Moha, Mada and M&#257;tsarya (lust, anger, greed, illusion, madness and envy). The Supreme Personality of Godhead appears in pure devotional service. This is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Vedas:</span> <span class="Italic">bhaktir evaina&#7745; dar&#347;ayati.</span> Only <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> can bring one in contact with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared from the womb of Devak&#299;, and therefore Devak&#299; symbolically represents <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> and Ka&#7745;sa symbolically represents material fear. When a pure devotee always fears material association, his real position of <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is manifested, and he naturally becomes uninterested in material enjoyment. When the six sons of Mar&#299;ci are killed by such fear and one is freed from material contamination, within the womb of <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears. Thus the seventh pregnancy of Devak&#299; signifies the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. After the six sons K&#257;ma, Krodha, Lobha, Moha, Mada and M&#257;tsarya are killed, the &#346;e&#7779;a incarnation creates a suitable situation for the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, when one awakens his natural K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appears. This is the explanation given by &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura.</div>

<div class="First">The word <span class="Italic">a&#7745;&#347;a-bh&#257;gena</span> is important in this verse. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index2334.html?g=3663">10.42</a>) the Lord says:</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;But what need is there, Arjuna, for all this detailed knowledge? With a single fragment of Myself I pervade and support this entire universe.&rdquo; Everything is situated as a part of the Supreme Lord&rsquo;s potency. In regard to Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s appearance in the womb of Devak&#299;, Brahm&#257; played a part also because on the bank of the milk ocean he requested the Supreme Personality of Godhead to appear. A part was also played by Baladeva, the first expansion of Godhead. Similarly, Yogam&#257;y&#257;, who appeared as the daughter of mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, also played a part. Thus <span class="Italic">j&#299;va-tattva, vi&#7779;&#7751;u-tattva</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;akti-tattva</span> are all integrated with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and when K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appears, He appears with all His integrated parts. As explained in previous verses, Yogam&#257;y&#257; was requested to attract Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a, Baladeva, from the womb of Devak&#299; to the womb of Rohi&#7751;&#299;, and this was a very heavy task for her. Yogam&#257;y&#257; naturally could not see how it was possible for her to attract Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a. Therefore K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a addressed her as <span class="Italic">&#347;ubhe,</span> auspicious, and said, &ldquo;Be blessed. Take power from Me, and you will be able to do it.&rdquo; By the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, anyone can do anything, for the Lord is present in everything, all things being His parts and parcels (<span class="Italic">a&#7745;&#347;a-bh&#257;gena</span>) and increasing or decreasing by His supreme will. Balar&#257;ma was only fifteen days older than K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. By the blessings of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Yogam&#257;y&#257; became the daughter of mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, but by the supreme will she was not able to enjoy the parental love of her father and mother. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, however, although not actually born from the womb of mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, enjoyed the parental love of mother Ya&#347;od&#257; and Nanda. By the blessings of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Yogam&#257;y&#257; was able to achieve the reputation of being the daughter of mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, who also became famous by the blessings of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.

Essentially, those who are interested in material enjoyment are <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;ktas,</span> and those interested in spiritual salvation and attaining the spiritual kingdom are Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas. Because people are generally interested in material enjoyment, they are interested in worshiping M&#257;y&#257;dev&#299;, the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas, however, are <span class="Italic">&#347;uddha-&#347;&#257;ktas,</span> or pure <span class="Italic">bhaktas,</span> because the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra</span> indicates worship of the Supreme Lord&rsquo;s energy, Har&#257;. A Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava prays to the energy of the Lord for the opportunity to serve the Lord along with His spiritual energy. Thus Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas all worship such Deities as R&#257;dh&#257;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, S&#299;t&#257;-R&#257;ma, Lak&#7779;m&#299;-N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a and Rukmi&#7751;&#299;-Dv&#257;rak&#257;dh&#299;&#347;a, whereas <span class="Italic">durg&#257;-&#347;&#257;ktas</span> worship the material energy under different names.</div>
<div class="Purport">The names by which M&#257;y&#257;dev&#299; is known in different places have been listed by Vallabh&#257;c&#257;rya as follows.

In the beginning of <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="index4dab.html?g=6120">1.1.1</a>) it is said, <span class="Italic">dh&#257;mn&#257; svena sad&#257; nirasta-kuhaka&#7745; satya&#7745; para&#7745; dh&#299;mahi.</span> In the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no influence of material energy (<span class="Italic">dh&#257;mn&#257; svena sad&#257; nirasta-kuhakam</span>). Any place where the Supreme Personality of Godhead is present by His name, form, qualities or paraphernalia immediately becomes a <span class="Italic">dh&#257;ma.</span> For example, we speak of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana-dh&#257;ma, Dv&#257;rak&#257;-dh&#257;ma and Mathur&#257;-dh&#257;ma because in these places the name, fame, qualities and paraphernalia of the Supreme Godhead are always present. Similarly, if one is empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to do something, the core of his heart becomes a <span class="Italic">dh&#257;ma,</span> and thus he becomes so extraordinarily powerful that not only his enemies but also people in general are astonished to observe his activities. Because he is unapproachable, his enemies are simply struck with wonder, as explained here by the words <span class="Italic">dur&#257;sado &rsquo;tidurdharsa&#7717;.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">The words <span class="Italic">pauru&#7779;a&#7745; dh&#257;ma</span> have been explained by various <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas.</span> &#346;r&#299; V&#299;rar&#257;ghava &#256;c&#257;rya says that these words refer to the effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vijayadhvaja says that they signify <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-tejas,</span> and &#346;ukadeva says <span class="Italic">bhagavat-svar&#363;pa.</span> The <span class="Italic">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-to&#7779;a&#7751;&#299;</span> says that these words indicate the influence of the Supreme Lord&rsquo;s effulgence, and Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura says that they signify the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Thereafter, accompanied by plenary expansions, the fully opulent Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is all-auspicious for the entire universe, was transferred from the mind of Vasudeva to the mind of Devak&#299;. Devak&#299;, having thus been initiated by Vasudeva, became beautiful by carrying Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the original consciousness for everyone, the cause of all causes, within the core of her heart, just as the east becomes beautiful by carrying the rising moon.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">As indicated here by the word <span class="Italic">manasta&#7717;,</span> the Supreme Personality of Godhead was transferred from the core of Vasudeva&rsquo;s mind or heart to the core of the heart of Devak&#299;. We should note carefully that the Lord was transferred to Devak&#299; not by the ordinary way for a human being, but by <span class="Italic">d&#299;k&#7779;&#257;,</span> initiation. Thus the importance of initiation is mentioned here. Unless one is initiated by the right person, who always carries within his heart the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one cannot acquire the power to carry the Supreme Godhead within the core of one&rsquo;s own heart.</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">acyut&#257;&#7745;&#347;am</span> is used because the Supreme Personality of Godhead is <span class="Italic">&#7778;a&#7693;-ai&#347;varya-p&#363;r&#7751;a,</span> full in the opulences of wealth, strength, fame, knowledge, beauty and renunciation. The Supreme Godhead is never separated from His personal opulences. As stated in the <span class="Ref_Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> (5.39), <span class="Italic">r&#257;m&#257;di-m&#363;rti&#7779;u kal&#257;-niyamena ti&#7779;&#7789;han:</span> the Lord is always situated with all His plenary expansions, such as R&#257;ma, N&#7771;si&#7745;ha and Var&#257;ha. Therefore the word <span class="Italic">acyut&#257;&#7745;&#347;am</span> is specifically used here, signifying that the Lord is always present with His plenary expansions and opulences. There is no need to think of the Lord artificially as <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> do. <span class="Italic">Dhy&#257;n&#257;vasthita-tad-gatena manas&#257; pa&#347;yanti ya&#7745; yogina&#7717;</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> 12.13.1). <span class="Italic">Yog&#299;s</span> meditate upon the Supreme person within the mind. For a devotee, however, the Lord is present, and His presence need only be awakened through initiation by a bona fide spiritual master. The Lord did not need to live within the womb of Devak&#299;, for His presence within the core of her heart was sufficient to carry Him. One is here forbidden to think that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was begotten by Vasudeva within the womb of Devak&#299; and that she carried the child within her womb.</div>
<div class="Purport">When Vasudeva was sustaining the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart, he appeared just like the glowing sun, whose shining rays are always unbearable and scorching to the common man. The form of the Lord situated in the pure, unalloyed heart of Vasudeva is not different from the original form of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The appearance of the form of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a anywhere, and specifically within the heart, is called <span class="Italic">dh&#257;ma.</span> <span class="Italic">Dh&#257;ma</span> refers not only to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s form, but to His name, His form, His quality and His paraphernalia. Everything becomes manifest simultaneously.</div>
<div class="Purport">Thus the eternal form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead with full potencies was transferred from the mind of Vasudeva to the mind of Devak&#299;, exactly as the setting sun&rsquo;s rays are transferred to the full moon rising in the east.</div>
<div class="Purport">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, entered the body of Devak&#299; from the body of Vasudeva. He was beyond the conditions of the ordinary living entity. When K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is there, it is to be understood that all His plenary expansions, such as N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, and incarnations like Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;ha and Var&#257;ha, are with Him, and they are not subject to the conditions of material existence. In this way, Devak&#299; became the residence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is one without a second and the cause of all creation. Devak&#299; became the residence of the Absolute Truth, but because she was within the house of Ka&#7745;sa, she looked just like a suppressed fire, or like misused education. When fire is covered by the walls of a pot or is kept in a jug, the illuminating rays of the fire cannot be very much appreciated. Similarly, misused knowledge, which does not benefit the people in general, is not very much appreciated. So Devak&#299; was kept within the prison walls of Ka&#7745;sa&rsquo;s palace, and no one could see her transcendental beauty, which resulted from her conceiving the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purport">Commenting upon this verse, &#346;r&#299; V&#299;rar&#257;ghava &#256;c&#257;rya writes, <span class="Italic">vasudeva-devak&#299; ja&#7789;harayor h&#7771;dayayor bhagavata&#7717; sambandha&#7717;.</span> The Supreme Lord&rsquo;s entrance into the womb of Devak&#299; from the heart of Vasudeva was a heart-to-heart relationship.</div>

<div class="Translation">Devak&#299; then kept within herself the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, the foundation of the entire cosmos, but because she was under arrest in the house of Ka&#7745;sa, she was like the flames of a fire covered by the walls of a pot, or like a person who has knowledge but cannot distribute it to the world for the benefit of human society.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In this verse the word <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na-khala</span> is most significant. Knowledge is meant for distribution. Although there is already much scientific knowledge, whenever scientists or philosophers awaken to a particular type of knowledge, they try to distribute it throughout the world, for otherwise the knowledge gradually dries up and no one benefits from it. India has the knowledge of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> but unfortunately, for some reason or other, this sublime knowledge of the science of God was not distributed throughout the world, although it is meant for all of human society. Therefore K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself appeared as &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu and ordered all Indians to take up the cause of distributing the knowledge of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> throughout the entire world.</div>

Now, therefore, the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement has been set up to distribute this knowledge as it is, without distortion. Although previously there were attempts to distribute the knowledge of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> these attempts involved distortion and compromise with mundane knowledge. But now the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, without mundane compromises, is distributing <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as it is, and people are deriving the benefits of awakening to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness and becoming devotees of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Therefore the proper distribution of knowledge has begun by which not only will the whole world benefit, but India&rsquo;s glory will be magnified in human society. Ka&#7745;sa tried to arrest K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness within his house (<span class="Italic">bhojendra-gehe</span>), with the result that Ka&#7745;sa, with all his opulences, was later vanquished. Similarly, the real knowledge of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> was being choked by unscrupulous Indian leaders, with the result that India&rsquo;s culture, and knowledge of the Supreme were being lost. Now, however, because K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness is spreading, the proper use of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> is being attempted.</div>

Human life is meant for God realization, but unfortunately the materialistic civilization is stressing only the senses of the body, not understanding the living force within the body. As clearly stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">dehino &rsquo;smin yath&#257; dehe</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexf962.html?g=502">2.13</a></I><span class="Italic">]</I></span>), within the body is the body&rsquo;s proprietor, the living force, which is more important. But human society has become so fallen that instead of understanding the living force within the body, people have become busy with external things. This is a discrepancy in human duties. Therefore K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a has taken birth or taken shelter within the womb of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement. Men of Ka&#7745;sa&rsquo;s class, therefore, are very much afraid and are busy trying to stop this movement, especially in the Western countries. One politician has remarked that the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is spreading like an epidemic and that if not checked immediately, within ten years it may capture governmental power. There is, of course, such potency in the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement.

The movement will go on increasing more and more, provided the leaders of the movement remain firmly K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious by following the regulative principles and the primary activities of chanting the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra</span> regularly.</div>

Therefore he was afraid of killing Devak&#299;, since she was a woman, she was his sister, and she was pregnant. A <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> becomes famous by performing heroic acts. But what would be heroic about killing a woman who, while confined in his custody, was under his shelter? Therefore, he did not want to act drastically by killing Devak&#299;. Ka&#7745;sa&rsquo;s enemy was within Devak&#299;&rsquo;s womb, but killing an enemy in such a nescient state would not be an exhibition of prowess. According to <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> rules, an enemy should be fought face to face and with proper weapons. Then if the enemy is killed, the victor becomes famous. Ka&#7745;sa very conscientiously deliberated upon these facts and therefore refrained from killing Devak&#299;, although he was completely confident that his enemy had already appeared within her womb.</div>

<div class="Translation">A person who is very cruel is regarded as dead even while living, for while he is living or after his death, everyone condemns him. And after the death of a person in the bodily concept of life, he is undoubtedly transferred to the hell known as Andhatama.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Ka&#7745;sa considered that if he killed his sister, while living he would be condemned by everyone, and after death he would go to the darkest region of hellish life because of his cruelty. It is said that a cruel person like a butcher is advised not to live and not to die. While living, a cruel person creates a hellish condition for his next birth, and therefore he should not live; but he is also advised not to die, because after death he must go to the darkest region of hell. Thus in either circumstance he is condemned. Ka&#7745;sa, therefore, having good sense about the science of the soul&rsquo;s transmigration, deliberately refrained from killing Devak&#299;.</div>
<div class="Purport">In this verse the words <span class="Italic">gant&#257; tamo &rsquo;ndha&#7745; tanu-m&#257;nino dhruvam</span> are very important and require extensive understanding. &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;, in his <span class="Italic">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-to&#7779;a&#7751;&#299;-&#7789;&#299;k&#257;,</span> says: <span class="Italic">tatra tanu-m&#257;nina&#7717; p&#257;pina iti deh&#257;tma-buddhyaiva p&#257;p&#257;bhinive&#347;o bhavati.</span> One who lives in the bodily concept, thinking, &ldquo;I am this body,&rdquo; involves himself, by the very nature of this conception, in a life of sinful activities.

<div class="After-Verse">Although the body is temporary, it always gives one trouble in many ways, but human civilization is now unfortunately based on <span class="Italic">tanu-m&#257;n&#299;,</span> the bodily concept of life, by which one thinks, &ldquo;I belong to this nation,&rdquo; &ldquo;I belong to this group,&rdquo; &ldquo;I belong to that group,&rdquo; and so on. Each of us has his own ideas, and we are becoming increasingly involved, individually, socially, communally and nationally, in the complexities of <span class="Italic">karm&#257;nubandha,</span> sinful activities. For the maintenance of the body, men are killing so many other bodies and becoming implicated in <span class="Italic">karm&#257;nubandha.</span> Therefore &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; says that <span class="Italic">tanu-m&#257;n&#299;,</span> those in the bodily concept of life, are <span class="Italic">p&#257;p&#299;,</span> sinful persons. For such sinful persons, the ultimate destination is the darkest region of hellish life (<span class="Italic">gant&#257; tamo &rsquo;ndham</span>).

<div class="Translation">While sitting on his throne or in his sitting room, while lying on his bed, or, indeed, while situated anywhere, and while eating, sleeping or walking, Ka&#7745;sa saw only his enemy, the Supreme Lord, H&#7771;&#7779;&#299;ke&#347;a. In other words, by thinking of his all-pervading enemy, Ka&#7745;sa became unfavorably K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">&#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; has described the finest pattern of devotional service as <span class="Italic">&#257;nuk&#363;lyena k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;&#257;nu&#347;&#299;lanam,</span> or cultivating K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness favorably. Ka&#7745;sa, of course, was also K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious, but because he regarded K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as his enemy, even though he was fully absorbed in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, his K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness was not favorable for his existence. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, favorably cultivated, makes one completely happy, so much so that a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious person does not consider <span class="Italic">kaivalya-sukham,</span> or merging into the existence of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, to be a great gain. <span class="Italic">Kaivalya&#7745; narak&#257;yate.</span> For a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious person, even merging into the existence of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, or Brahman, as impersonalists aspire to do, is uncomfortable. <span class="Italic">Kaivalya&#7745; narak&#257;yate trida&#347;a-p&#363;r &#257;k&#257;&#347;a-pu&#7779;p&#257;yate.</span> <span class="Italic">Karm&#299;s</span> hanker to be promoted to the heavenly planets, but a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious person considers such promotion a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp, good for nothing. <span class="Italic">Durd&#257;ntendriya-k&#257;la-sarpa-pa&#7789;al&#299; protkh&#257;ta-da&#7745;&#7779;&#7789;r&#257;yate.</span> <span class="Italic">Yog&#299;s</span> try to control their senses and thus become happy, but a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious person neglects the methods of <span class="Italic">yoga.</span> He is unconcerned with the greatest of enemies, the senses, which are compared to snakes. For a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious person who is cultivating K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness favorably, the happiness conceived by the <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s, j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> is treated as less than a fig. Ka&#7745;sa, however, because of cultivating K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness in a different way&mdash;that is, inimically&mdash;was uncomfortable in all the affairs of his life; whether sitting, sleeping, walking or eating, he was always in danger. This is the difference between a devotee and a nondevotee. A nondevotee or atheist also cultivates God consciousness&mdash;by trying to avoid God in everything. For example, so-called scientists who want to create life by a combination of chemicals regard the external, material elements as supreme. Such scientists do not like the idea that life is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. As clearly stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">mamaiv&#257;&#7745;&#347;o j&#299;va-loke j&#299;va-bh&#363;ta&#7717;</span>), the living entities do not arise from a combination of material elements, such as earth, water, air and fire, but are separated portions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one can understand the position of the living entity as a separated portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by studying the nature of the living entity one can understand the nature of the Supreme Godhead, since the living entity is a fragmental sample of the Godhead. But because atheists are not interested in God consciousness, they try to be happy by cultivating K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness in various unfavorable ways.</div>
<div class="Purport">Although Ka&#7745;sa was always absorbed in thoughts of Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he was not happy. A devotee, however, whether sitting on a throne or beneath a tree, is always happy. &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; resigned from office as a government minister to sit beneath a tree, yet he was happy. <span class="Italic">Tyaktv&#257; t&#363;r&#7751;am a&#347;e&#7779;a-ma&#7751;&#7693;alapati-&#347;re&#7751;&#299;&#7745; sad&#257; tucchavat</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">&#7778;a&#7693;-gosv&#257;my-a&#7779;&#7789;aka</span> 4). He did not care for his comfortable position as minister; he was happy even beneath a tree in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, favorably serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the difference between a devotee and a nondevotee. For a nondevotee, the world is full of problems, whereas for a devotee the entire world is full of happiness.</div>

<div class="Translation">The demigods prayed: O Lord, You never deviate from Your vow, which is always perfect because whatever You decide is perfectly correct and cannot be stopped by anyone. Being present in the three phases of cosmic manifestation&mdash;creation, maintenance and annihilation&mdash;You are the Supreme Truth. Indeed, unless one is completely truthful, one cannot achieve Your favor, which therefore cannot be achieved by hypocrites. You are the active principle, the real truth, in all the ingredients of creation, and therefore you are known as antary&#257;m&#299;, the inner force. You are equal to everyone, and Your instructions apply for everyone, for all time. You are the beginning of all truth. Therefore, offering our obeisances, we surrender unto You. Kindly give us protection.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The demigods or devotees know perfectly well that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the true substance, whether within this material world or in the spiritual world. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> begins, therefore, with the words <span class="Italic">o&#7745; namo bhagavate v&#257;sudev&#257;ya.</span> <span class="Italic">.. satya&#7745; para&#7745; dh&#299;mahi.</span> V&#257;sudeva, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, is the <span class="Italic">para&#7745; satyam,</span> the Supreme Truth. The Supreme Truth can be approached or understood by the supreme method, as declared by the Supreme Truth: <span class="Italic">bhakty&#257; m&#257;m abhij&#257;n&#257;ti y&#257;v&#257;n ya&#347; c&#257;smi tattvata&#7717;</span> (Bg. <a href="indexbf7d.html?g=5898">18.55</a>). <span class="Italic">Bhakti,</span> devotional service, is the only way to understand the Absolute Truth. For protection, therefore, the demigods surrender to the Supreme Truth, not to the relative truth. There are persons who worship various demigods, but the Supreme Truth, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, declares in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index6165.html?g=2667">7.23</a>), <span class="Italic">antavat tu phala&#7745; te&#7779;&#257;&#7745; tad bhavaty alpa-medhas&#257;m:</span> &ldquo;Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary.&rdquo; Worship of demigods may be useful for a limited time, but the result is <span class="Italic">antavat,</span> perishable. This material world is impermanent, the demigods are impermanent, and the benedictions derived from the demigods are also impermanent, whereas the living entity is eternal (<span class="Italic">nityo nity&#257;n&#257;&#7745; cetana&#347; cetan&#257;n&#257;m</span>). Every living entity, therefore, must search for eternal happiness, not temporary happiness. The words <span class="Italic">satya&#7745; para&#7745; dh&#299;mahi</span> indicate that one should search for the Absolute Truth, not the relative truth.</div>
<div class="Purport">While offering prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva, Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja said:</div>

<div class="Normal-Level">(<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="indexc3aa.html?g=57004">7.9.19</a>)</div>
<div class="Purport">If neglected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a child, despite the presence of his parents, will suffer, and a diseased person, despite all medical help, will die. In this material world, where there is a struggle for existence, men have invented many means for protection, but these are useless if the Supreme Personality of Godhead rejects them. Therefore the demigods purposefully say, <span class="Italic">saty&#257;tmaka&#7745; tv&#257;&#7745; &#347;ara&#7751;a&#7745; prapann&#257;&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;Real protection can be obtained from You, O Lord, and therefore we surrender unto You,&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">The Lord demands that one surrender unto Him (<span class="Italic">sarva-dharm&#257;n parityajya m&#257;m eka&#7745; &#347;ara&#7751;a&#7745; vraja</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="index3a32.html?g=5997">18.66</a>]), and He further says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">sak&#7771;d eva prapanno yas<br>tav&#257;sm&#299;ti ca y&#257;cate<br>abhaya&#7745; sarvad&#257; tasmai<br>dad&#257;my etad vrata&#7745; mama</div>
</div><A NAME="122051"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;If one surrenders unto Me sincerely, saying, &lsquo;My Lord, from this day I am fully surrendered unto You,&rsquo; I always give him protection. That is My vow.&rdquo; (<span class="Ref_Italic">R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a, Yuddha-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</span> 18.33) The demigods offered their prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead because He had now appeared in the womb of His devotee Devak&#299; to protect all the devotees harassed by Ka&#7745;sa and his lieutenants. Thus the Lord acts as <span class="Italic">satyavrata.</span> The protection given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be compared to the protection given by the demigods. It is said that R&#257;va&#7751;a was a great devotee of Lord &#346;iva, but when Lord R&#257;macandra went to kill him, Lord &#346;iva could not give him protection.</div>
<div class="Purport">Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord &#346;iva, accompanied by great sages like N&#257;rada and followed by many other demigods, had now invisibly appeared in the house of Ka&#7745;sa. They began to pray for the Supreme Personality of Godhead in select prayers which are very pleasing to the devotees and which award fulfillment of devotional desires. The first words they spoke acclaimed that the Lord is true to His vow. As stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a descends upon this material world just to protect the pious and destroy the impious. That is His vow. The demigods could understand that the Lord had taken His residence within the womb of Devak&#299; to fulfill this vow. They were very glad that the Lord was appearing to fulfill His mission, and they addressed Him as <span class="Italic">satya&#7745; param,</span> or the Supreme Absolute Truth.</div>
<div class="Purport">Everyone is searching after the truth. That is the philosophical way of life. The demigods give information that the Supreme Absolute Truth is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. One who becomes fully K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious can attain the Absolute Truth. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the Absolute Truth. Relative truth is not truth in all the three phases of eternal time. Time is divided into past, present and future. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is Truth always, past, present and future. In the material world, everything is being controlled by supreme time, in the course of past, present and future. But before the creation, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was existing, and when there is creation, everything is resting in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and when this creation is finished, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a will remain. Therefore, He is Absolute Truth in all circumstances, If there is any truth within this material world, it emanates from the Supreme Truth, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. If there is any opulence within this material world, the cause of the opulence is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. If there is any reputation within this material world, the cause of the reputation is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. If there is any strength within this material world, the cause of such strength is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. If there is any wisdom and education within this material world, the cause of such wisdom and education is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Therefore K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the source of all relative truths.</div>
<div class="Purport">Devotees, therefore, following in the footsteps of Lord Brahm&#257;, pray, <span class="Italic">govindam &#257;di-puru&#7779;a&#7745; tam aha&#7745; bhaj&#257;mi **,</span> worshiping the <span class="Italic">&#257;di-puru&#7779;a,</span> the supreme truth, Govinda. Everything, everywhere, is performed in terms of three principles, <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na-bala-kriy&#257;</span>&mdash;knowledge, strength and activity. In every field, if there is not full knowledge, full strength and full activity, an endeavor is never successful. Therefore, if one wants success in everything, one must be backed by these three principles. In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;vet&#257;&#347;vatara Upani&#7779;ad</span> 6.8) there is this statement about the Supreme Personality of Godhead:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">na tasya k&#257;rya&#7745; kara&#7751;a&#7745; ca vidyate<br>na tat sama&#347; c&#257;bhyadhika&#347; ca d&#7771;&#347;yate<br>par&#257;sya &#347;aktir vividhaiva &#347;r&#363;yate<br>sv&#257;bh&#257;vik&#299; j&ntilde;&#257;na-bala-kriy&#257; ca</div>
</div><A NAME="122056"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">The Supreme Personality of Godhead does not need to do anything personally, for He has such potencies that anything He wants done will be done perfectly well through the control of material nature (<span class="Italic">sv&#257;bh&#257;vik&#299; j&ntilde;&#257;na-bala-kriy&#257; ca</span>). Similarly, those who are engaged in the service of the Lord are not meant to struggle for existence. The devotees who are fully engaged in spreading the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, more than ten thousand men and women all over the world, have no steady or permanent occupation, yet we actually see that they are maintained very opulently. The Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index36d6.html?g=3183">9.22</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">anany&#257;&#347; cintayanto m&#257;&#7745;<br>ye jan&#257;&#7717; paryup&#257;sate<br>te&#7779;&#257;&#7745; nity&#257;bhiyukt&#257;n&#257;&#7745;<br>yoga-k&#7779;ema&#7745; vah&#257;my aham</div>
</div><A NAME="122058"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;For those who worship Me with devotion, meditating on My transcendental form, I carry to them what they lack and preserve what they have.&rdquo; The devotees have no anxiety over what will happen next, where they will stay or what they will eat, for everything is maintained and supplied by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has promised, <span class="Italic">kaunteya pratij&#257;n&#299;hi na me bhakta&#7717; pra&#7751;a&#347;yati:</span> &ldquo;O son of Kunt&#299;, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes.&rdquo; (Bg. <a href="indexa9e1.html?g=3264">9.31</a>) From all angles of vision, therefore, in all circumstances, if one fully surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no question of one&rsquo;s struggling for existence. In this connection, the commentary by &#346;r&#299;p&#257;da Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya, who quotes from the <span class="Italic">Tantra-bh&#257;gavata,</span> is very meaningful:</div>

<div class="After-Verse">Explaining the words <span class="Italic">satyasya yonim,</span> &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura says that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the <span class="Italic">avat&#257;r&#299;,</span> the origin of all incarnations. All incarnations are the Absolute Truth, yet the Supreme Personality of Godhead K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the origin of all incarnations. <span class="Italic">D&#299;p&#257;rcir eva hi da&#347;&#257;ntaram abhyupetya d&#299;p&#257;yate</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> 5.46). There may be many lamps, all equal in power, yet there is a first lamp, a second lamp, a third lamp and so on. Similarly, there are many incarnations, who are compared to lamps, but the first lamp, the original Personality of Godhead, is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. <span class="Italic">Govindam &#257;di-puru&#7779;a&#7745; tam aha&#7745; bhaj&#257;mi **.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">The demigods must offer worship in obedience to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but one might argue that since the Supreme Godhead was within the womb of Devak&#299;, He was also coming in a material body. Why then should He be worshiped? Why should one make a distinction between an ordinary living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead? These questions are answered in the following verses.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">The body [the total body and the individual body are of the same composition] may figuratively be called &ldquo;the original tree.&rdquo; From this tree, which fully depends on the ground of material nature, come two kinds of fruit&mdash;the enjoyment of happiness and the suffering of distress. The cause of the tree, forming its three roots, is association with the three modes of material nature&mdash;goodness, passion and ignorance. The fruits of bodily happiness have four tastes&mdash;religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and liberation&mdash;which are experienced through five senses for acquiring knowledge in the midst of six circumstances: lamentation, illusion, old age, death, hunger and thirst. The seven layers of bark covering the tree are skin, blood, muscle, fat, bone, marrow and semen, and the eight branches of the tree are the five gross and three subtle elements&mdash;earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego. The tree of the body has nine hollows&mdash;the eyes, the ears, the nostrils, the mouth, the rectum and the genitals&mdash;and ten leaves, the ten airs passing through the body. In this tree of the body there are two birds: one is the individual soul, and the other is the Supersoul.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This material world is composed of five principal elements&mdash;earth, water, fire, air and ether&mdash;all of which are emanations from K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Although materialistic scientists may accept these five primary elements as the cause of the material manifestation, these elements in their gross and subtle states are produced by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, whose marginal potency also produces the living entities working within this material world. The Seventh Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> clearly states that the entire cosmic manifestation is a combination of two of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s energies&mdash;the superior energy and the inferior energy. The living entities are the superior energy, and the inanimate material elements are His inferior energy. In the dormant stage, everything rests in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>
<div class="Purport">Material scientists cannot give such a thorough analysis of the material structure of the body. The analysis of the material scientists concerns itself only with inanimate matter, but this is inadequate because the living entity is completely separate from the material bodily structure. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index8294.html?g=2505">7.5</a>) the Lord says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">apareyam itas tv any&#257;&#7745;<br>prak&#7771;ti&#7745; viddhi me par&#257;m<br>j&#299;va-bh&#363;t&#257;&#7745; mah&#257;-b&#257;ho<br>yayeda&#7745; dh&#257;ryate jagat</div>
</div><A NAME="122078"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine, which consists of all the living entities who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe.&rdquo; Although the material elements emanate from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, they are separated elements and are sustained by the living elements.</div>
<div class="Purport">As indicated by the word <span class="Italic">dvi-khaga&#7717;,</span> the living elements within the body resemble two birds in a tree. <span class="Italic">Kha</span> means &ldquo;sky,&rdquo; and <span class="Italic">ga</span> means &ldquo;one who flies.&rdquo; Thus the word <span class="Italic">dvi-khaga&#7717;</span> refers to birds. In the tree of the body there are two birds, or two living elements, and they are always different. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexc1e9.html?g=4331">13.3</a>), the Lord says, <span class="Italic">k&#7779;etra j&ntilde;a&#7745; c&#257;pi m&#257;&#7745; viddhi sarva-k&#7779;etre&#7779;u bh&#257;rata:</span> &ldquo;O scion of Bharata, you should understand that I am also the knower in all bodies.&rdquo; The <span class="Italic">k&#7779;etra j&ntilde;a,</span> the owner of the body, is also called the <span class="Italic">khaga,</span> the living entity. Within the body there are two such <span class="Italic">k&#7779;etra j&ntilde;as</span>&mdash;the individual soul and the Supersoul. The individual soul is the owner of his individual body, but the Supersoul is present within the bodies of all living entities. Such a thorough analysis and understanding of the bodily structure cannot be obtained anywhere but in the Vedic literature.</div>
<div class="Purport">When two birds enter a tree, one may foolishly think that the birds become one or merge with the tree, but actually they do not. Rather, each bird keeps its individual identity. Similarly, the individual soul and the Supersoul do not become one, nor do they merge with matter. The living entity lives close to matter, but this does not mean that he merges or mixes with it (<span class="Italic">asa&#7749;go hy aya&#7745; puru&#7779;a&#7717;</span>), although material scientists mistakenly see the organic and inorganic, or animate and inanimate, to be mixed.</div>
<div class="Purport">Vedic knowledge has been kept imprisoned or concealed, but every human being needs to understand it in truth. The modern civilization of ignorance is simply engaged in analyzing the body, and thus people come to the erroneous conclusion that the living force within the body is generated under certain material conditions. People have no information of the soul, but this verse gives the perfect explanation that there are two living forces (<span class="Italic">dvi-khaga</span>): the individual soul and the Supersoul. The Supersoul is present in every body (<span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;vara&#7717; sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;n&#257;&#7745; h&#7771;d-de&#347;e &rsquo;rjuna ti&#7779;&#7789;hati</I> [Bg. </I><a href="index0d72.html?g=5952">18.61</a></I>]</I></span>), whereas the individual soul is situated only in his own body (<span class="Italic">deh&#299;</span>) and is transmigrating from one body to another.</div>

<div class="Translation">The efficient cause of this material world, manifested with its many varieties as the original tree, is You, O Lord. You are also the maintainer of this material world, and after annihilation You are the one in whom everything is conserved. Those who are covered by Your external energy cannot see You behind this manifestation, but theirs is not the vision of learned devotees.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Various demigods, beginning from Lord Brahm&#257;, Lord &#346;iva and even Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, are supposed to be the creator, maintainer and annihilator of this material world, but actually they are not. The fact is that everything is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, manifested in varieties of energy. <span class="Italic">Ekam ev&#257;dvit&#299;ya&#7745; brahma.</span> There is no second existence. Those who are truly <span class="Italic">vipa&#347;cit,</span> learned, are those who have reached the platform of understanding and observing the Supreme Personality of Godhead in any condition of life. <span class="Italic">prem&#257;&ntilde;jana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santa&#7717; sadaiva h&#7771;daye&#7779;u vilokayanti</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> 5.38). Learned devotees accept even conditions of distress as representing the presence of the Supreme Lord. When a devotee is in distress, he sees that the Lord has appeared as distress just to relieve or purify the devotee from the contamination of the material world. While one is within this material world, one is in various conditions, and therefore a devotee sees a condition of distress as but another feature of the Lord. <span class="Italic">Tat te&rsquo;nukamp&#257;&#7745; susam&#299;k&#7779;am&#257;&#7751;a&#7717;</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> 10.14.8). A devotee, therefore, regards distress as a great favor of the Lord because he understands that he is being cleansed of contamination. <span class="Italic">Te&#7779;&#257;m aha&#7745; samuddhart&#257; m&#7771;tyu-sa&#7745;s&#257;ra-s&#257;gar&#257;t</span> (Bg. <a href="index461c.html?g=4195">12.7</a>). The appearance of distress is a negative process intended to give the devotee relief from this material world, which is called <span class="Italic">m&#7771;tyu-sa&#7745;s&#257;ra,</span> or the constant repetition of birth and death. To save a surrendered soul from repeated birth and death, the Lord purifies him of contamination by offering him a little distress. This cannot be understood by a nondevotee, but a devotee can see this because he is <span class="Italic">vipa&#347;cit,</span> or learned. A nondevotee, therefore, is perturbed in distress, but a devotee welcomes distress as another feature of the Lord. <span class="Italic">Sarva&#7745; khalv ida&#7745; brahma.</span> A devotee can actually see that there is only the Supreme Personality of Godhead and no second entity. <span class="Italic">Ekam ev&#257;dvit&#299;yam.</span> There is only the Lord, who presents Himself in different energies.</div>
<div class="Purport">Persons who are not in real knowledge think that Brahm&#257; is the creator, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u the maintainer and &#346;iva the annihilator and that the different demigods are intended to fulfill diverse purposes. Thus they create diverse purposes and worship various demigods to have these purposes fulfilled (<span class="Italic">k&#257;mais tais tair h&#7771;ta j&ntilde;&#257;n&#257;&#7717; prapadyante &rsquo;nya-devat&#257;&#7717; </I>[Bg. </I></span><a href="indexda67.html?g=2640">7.20</a>]). A devotee, however, knows that these various demigods are but different parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that these parts need not be worshiped. As the Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexae45.html?g=3192">9.23</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">ye &rsquo;py anya-devat&#257; bhakt&#257;<br>yajante &#347;raddhay&#257;nvit&#257;&#7717;<br>te &rsquo;pi m&#257;m eva kaunteya<br>yajanty avidhi-p&#363;rvakam</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Whatever a man may sacrifice to other gods, O son of Kunt&#299;, is really meant for Me alone, but it is offered without true understanding.&rdquo; There is no need to worship the demigods, for this is <span class="Italic">avidhi,</span> not in order. Simply by surrendering oneself at the lotus feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, one can completely discharge one&rsquo;s duties; there is no need to worship various deities or demigods. These various divinities are observed by the <span class="Italic">m&#363;&#7693;has,</span> fools, who are bewildered by the three modes of material nature (<span class="Italic">tribhir gu&#7751;amayair bh&#257;vair ebhi&#7717; sarvam ida&#7745; jagat</span>).

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>

Instead, being carried away by the waves of material nature (<span class="Italic">prak&#7771;te&#7717; kriyam&#257;&#7751;&#257;ni gu&#7751;ai&#7717; karm&#257;&#7751;i sarva&#347;a&#7717;</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index15ec.html?g=1275">3.27</a>]), they are undergoing the tribulations of <span class="Italic">m&#7771;tyu-sa&#7745;s&#257;ra-vartmani,</span> repeated birth and death. But persons who have achieved knowledge by the association of devotees follow the <span class="Italic">mah&#257;janas</span> (<span class="Italic">mahat-k&#7771;tena</span>). Such a person always concentrates his mind upon the lotus feet of the Lord and executes one or more of the nine varieties of devotional service (<span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;a&#7745; k&#299;rtana&#7745; vi&#7779;&#7751;o&#7717; smara&#7751;a&#7745; p&#257;da-sevanam </I>[SB </I></span><a href="indexda76.html?g=55355">7.5.23</a>]).

According to this verse, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it became liberated by fully concentrating his mind on hearing the Lord&rsquo;s holy name, attributes and pastimes. Similarly, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; simply glorified the Lord, and by speaking on the subject matters of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a that constitute the entire <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> he too was liberated. One may also be liberated simply by <span class="Italic">sakhya,</span> friendly behavior with the Lord.

<div class="Purport">We have to follow in the footsteps of such devotees, for by this one easy process one can cross the great ocean of nescience just as one might cross a small hole created by the hoof of a calf.</div>
<div class="Purport">Here the Lord is described as <span class="Italic">ambuj&#257;k&#7779;a,</span> or lotus-eyed. By seeing the eyes of the Lord, which are compared to lotus flowers, one becomes so satisfied that one does not want to turn his eyes to anything else. Simply by seeing the transcendental form of the Lord, a devotee is at once fully absorbed in the Lord in his heart. This absorption is called <span class="Italic">sam&#257;dhi.</span> <span class="Italic">Dhy&#257;n&#257;vasthita-tad-gatena manas&#257; pa&#347;yanti ya&#7745; yogina&#7717;</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> 12.13.1). A <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> is fully absorbed in thoughts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for he has no other business than to think of the Lord always within the heart. It is also said:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">sam&#257;&#347;rit&#257; ye pada-pallava-plava&#7745;<br>mahat-pada&#7745; pu&#7751;ya-ya&#347;o mur&#257;re&#7717;<br>bhav&#257;mbudhir vatsa-pada&#7745; para&#7745; pada&#7745;<br>pada&#7745; pada&#7745; yad vipad&#257;&#7745; na te&#7779;&#257;m</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;For one who has accepted the boat of the lotus feet of the Lord, who is the shelter of the cosmic manifestation and is famous as Mur&#257;ri, the enemy of the demon Mura, the ocean of the material world is like the water contained in a calf&rsquo;s hoofprint. His goal is <span class="Italic">para&#7745; padam,</span> or Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha, the place where there are no material miseries, not the place where there is danger at every step.&rdquo; (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> 10.14.58) This process is recommended here by authorities like Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord &#346;iva (<span class="Italic">svayambh&#363;r n&#257;rada&#7717; &#347;ambhu&#7717;</span> [SB <a href="index94f8.html?g=47678">6.3.20</a>]), and therefore we must take to this process in order to transcend nescience. This is very easy, but we must follow in the footsteps of great personalities, and then success will be possible.</div>
<div class="Purport">In regard to the word <span class="Italic">mahat-k&#7771;tena,</span> it is also significant that the process shown by great devotees is not only for them but also for others.

After wandering throughout the universe, a fortunate person within this material world seeks shelter of such a <span class="Italic">guru,</span> or <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya,</span> who trains the devotee in the suitable ways to render service according to the circumstances so that the Supreme Personality of Godhead will accept the service. This makes it easier for the candidate to reach the ultimate destination. The <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya&rsquo;s</span> duty, therefore, is to find the means by which devotees may render service according to references from <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra.</span> R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299;, for example, in order to help subsequent devotees, published such devotional books as <span class="Italic">Bhakti-ras&#257;m&#7771;ta-sindhu.</span> Thus it is the duty of the <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya</span> to publish books that will help future candidates take up the method of service and become eligible to return home, back to Godhead, by the mercy of the Lord. In our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, this same path is being prescribed and followed. Thus the devotees have been advised to refrain from four sinful activities&mdash;illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling&mdash;and to chant sixteen rounds a day. These are bona fide instructions. Because in the Western countries constant chanting is not possible, one should not artificially imitate Harid&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura, but should follow this method. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a will accept a devotee who strictly follows the regulative principles and the method prescribed in the various books and literatures published by the authorities. The <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya</span> gives the suitable method for crossing the ocean of nescience by accepting the boat of the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet, and if this method is strictly followed, the followers will ultimately reach the destination, by the grace of the Lord. This method is called <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya-samprad&#257;ya.</span> It is therefore said, <span class="Italic">samprad&#257;ya-vih&#299;n&#257; ye mantr&#257;s te ni&#7779;phal&#257; mat&#257;&#7717;</span> (<span class="Italic">Padma Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span>). The <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya-samprad&#257;ya</span> is strictly bona fide. Therefore one must accept the <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya-samprad&#257;ya;</span> otherwise one&rsquo;s endeavor will be futile. &#346;r&#299;la Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura therefore sings:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">t&#257;&#7749;dera cara&#7751;a sevi bhakta sane v&#257;sa<br>janame janame haya, ei abhil&#257;&#7779;a</div>

<div class="Translation">[Someone may say that aside from devotees, who always seek shelter at the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet, there are those who are not devotees but who have accepted different processes for attaining salvation. What happens to them? In answer to this question, Lord Brahm&#257; and the other demigods said:] O lotus-eyed Lord, although nondevotees who accept severe austerities and penances to achieve the highest position may think themselves liberated, their intelligence is impure. They fall down from their position of imagined superiority because they have no regard for Your lotus feet.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Aside from devotees, there are many others, nondevotees, known as <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s, j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s</span> or <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s,</span> philanthropists, altruists, politicians, impersonalists and voidists. There are many varieties of nondevotees who have their respective ways of liberation, but simply because they do not know the shelter of the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet, although they falsely think that they have been liberated and elevated to the highest position, they fall down. As clearly stated by the Lord Himself in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index508f.html?g=3012">9.3</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">a&#347;raddadh&#257;n&#257;&#7717; puru&#7779;&#257;<br>dharmasy&#257;sya parantapa<br>apr&#257;pya m&#257;&#7745; nivartante<br>m&#7771;tyu-sa&#7745;s&#257;ra-vartmani</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Those who are not faithful on the path of devotional service cannot attain Me, O conqueror of foes, but return to birth and death in this material world.&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether one is a <span class="Italic">karm&#299;, j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;, yog&#299;,</span> philanthropist, politician or whatever; if one has no love for the lotus feet of the Lord, one falls down. That is the verdict given by Lord brahma in this verse.</div>
<div class="Purport">There are persons who advocate accepting any process and who say that whatever process one accepts will lead to the same goal, but that is refuted in this verse, where such persons are referred to as <span class="Italic">vimukta-m&#257;nina&#7717;,</span> signifying that although they think they have attained the highest perfection, in fact they have not. In the present day, big, big politicians all over the world think that by scheming they can occupy the highest political post, that of president or prime minister, but we actually see that even in this life such big prime ministers, presidents and other politicians, because of being nondevotees, fall down (<span class="Italic">patanty adha&#7717;</span>). To become president or prime minister is not easy; one must work very hard (<span class="Italic">&#257;ruhya k&#7771;cchre&#7751;a</span>) to achieve the post. And even though one may reach his goal, at any moment one may be kicked down by material nature. In human society there have been many instances in which great, exalted politicians have fallen from government and become lost in historical oblivion. The cause of this is <span class="Italic">avi&#347;uddha-buddhaya&#7717;:</span> their intelligence is impure. The <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra</span> says, <span class="Italic">na te vidu&#7717; sv&#257;rtha-gati&#7745; hi vi&#7779;&#7751;um</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="index2706.html?g=55424">7.5.31</a>). One achieves the perfection of life by becoming a devotee of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, but people do not know this. Therefore, as stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index3958.html?g=4186">12.5</a>), <span class="Italic">kle&#347;o &rsquo;dhikataras te&#7779;&#257;m avyakt&#257;sakta-cetas&#257;m.</span> Persons who do not ultimately accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead and take to devotional service, but who instead are attached to impersonalism and voidism, must undergo great labor to achieve their goals.</div>

<div class="Purport">Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja at first wanted to achieve the greatest material kingdom and greater material possessions than his father, but when he was actually favored by the Lord, who appeared before him to give him the benediction he desired, Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja refused it, saying, <span class="Italic">sv&#257;min k&#7771;t&#257;rtho&rsquo;smi vara&#7745; na y&#257;ce:</span> &ldquo;Now I am fully satisfied.

<div class="Purport">At night, no one can see a lotus, for lotuses blossom only during the daytime. Therefore the word <span class="Italic">aravind&#257;k&#7779;a</span> is significant.

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">O M&#257;dhava, Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord of the goddess of fortune, if devotees completely in love with You sometimes fall from the path of devotion, they do not fall like nondevotees, for You still protect them. Thus they fearlessly traverse the heads of their opponents and continue to progress in devotional service.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Devotees generally do not fall down, but if circumstantially they do, the Lord, because of their strong attachment to Him, gives them protection in all circumstances. Thus even if devotees fall down, they are still strong enough to traverse the heads of their enemies. We have actually seen that our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement has many opponents, such as the &ldquo;deprogrammers,&rdquo; who instituted a strong legal case against the devotees. We thought that this case would take a long time to settle, but because the devotees were protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we unexpectedly won the case in one day. Thus a case that was expected to continue for years was settled in a day because of the protection of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has promised in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexa9e1.html?g=3264">9.31</a>), <span class="Italic">kaunteya pratij&#257;n&#299;hi na me bhakta&#7717; pra&#7751;a&#347;yati:</span> &ldquo;O son of Kunt&#299;, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes.&rdquo; In history there are many instances of devotees like Citraketu, Indradyumna and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata who circumstantially fell down but were still protected. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata, for example, because of his attachment to a deer, thought of the deer at the time of death, and therefore in his next life he became a deer (<span class="Italic">ya&#7745; ya&#7745; v&#257;pi smaran bh&#257;va&#7745; tyajaty ante kalevaram </I>[Bg.</I> </span><a href="index473d.html?g=2787">8.6</a>]). Because of protection by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, the deer remembered his relationship with the Lord and next took birth in a good brahminical family and performed devotional service (<span class="Italic">&#347;uc&#299;n&#257;&#7745; &#347;r&#299;mat&#257;&#7745; gehe yoga-bhra&#7779;&#7789;o &rsquo;bhij&#257;yate</span>). Similarly, Citraketu fell down and became a demon, V&#7771;tr&#257;sura, but he too was protected. Thus even if one falls down from the path of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> one is ultimately saved. If a devotee is strongly situated in devotional service, the Supreme Personality of Godhead has promised to protect him (<span class="Italic">kaunteya pratij&#257;n&#299;hi na me bhakta&#7717; pra&#7751;a&#347;yati</span>). But even if a devotee circumstantially falls down, he is protected by M&#257;dhava.</div>
<div class="Purport">The word M&#257;dhava is significant. <span class="Italic">M&#257;,</span> mother Lak&#7779;m&#299;, the mother of all opulences, is always with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and if a devotee is in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, all the opulences of the Lord are ready to help him.</div>

<div class="Purport">Wherever there is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and His devotee Arjuna, P&#257;rtha, there is victory, opulence, extraordinary power and morality. The opulences of a devotee are not a result of <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a-vic&#257;ra.</span> A devotee is always protected by all of the Supreme Lord&rsquo;s opulences, of which no one can deprive him (<span class="Italic">te&#7779;&#257;&#7745; nity&#257;bhiyukt&#257;n&#257;&#7745; yoga-k&#7779;ema&#7745; vah&#257;my aham</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index36d6.html?g=3183">9.22</a>]). Thus a devotee cannot be defeated by any opponents. A devotee, therefore, should not deviate knowingly from the path of devotion.

Everyone is acting in a bodily concept of life involving society, friendship and love for the improvement of economic and political conditions, and thus all activities are enacted in ignorance. The Supreme Personality therefore comes to teach us how to act according to the Vedic principles. In this age of Kali, the Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared as &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu and preached that in this age the Vedic activities cannot be systematically performed because people are so fallen.

Out of causeless mercy, the Lord appears in different ages in His original <span class="Italic">&#347;uddha-sattva</span> transcendental body to elevate human society to the spiritual platform upon which they can truly benefit.

Essentially such activities are the activities of animals (<span class="Italic">sa eva go-khara&#7717;</I> [SB </I></span>10.84.13]). We should learn how to act from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> which explains everything for human understanding. Thus we can become happy even in this age of Kali.</div>

<div class="Translation">O Lord, cause of all causes, if Your transcendental body were not beyond the modes of material nature, one could not understand the difference between matter and transcendence. Only by Your presence can one understand the transcendental nature of Your Lordship, who are the controller of material nature. Your transcendental nature is very difficult to understand unless one is influenced by the presence of Your transcendental form.</div>

Devotees who awaken their transcendental nature in the presence of the Lord and who follow the rules and regulations of devotional service can understand Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Lord R&#257;macandra and other incarnations, who are not of this material world but who come from the spiritual world for the benefit of people in general. If one does not take to this process, one imagines or manufactures some form of God according to material qualities and can never awaken a real understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The words <span class="Italic">bhakty&#257; m&#257;m abhij&#257;n&#257;ti y&#257;v&#257;n ya&#347; c&#257;smi tattvata&#7717;</span> signify that unless one worships the Lord according to the regulative devotional principles, one cannot awaken the transcendental nature. Deity worship, even in the absence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, awakens the transcendental nature of the devotee, who thus becomes increasingly attached to the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet.</div>
<div class="Purport">The appearance of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the answer to all imaginative iconography of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Everyone imagines the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead according to his mode of material nature. In the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> it is said that the Lord is the oldest person. Therefore a section of religionists imagine that God must be very old, and therefore they depict a form of the Lord like a very old man. But in the same <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;,</span> that is contradicted; although He is the oldest of all living entities, He has His eternal form as a fresh youth. The exact words used in this connection in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> are <span class="Italic">vij&ntilde;&#257;nam aj&ntilde;&#257;na-bhid&#257;pam&#257;rjanam.</span> <span class="Italic">Vij&ntilde;&#257;na</span> means transcendental knowledge of the Supreme Personality; <span class="Italic">vij&ntilde;&#257;na</span> is also experienced knowledge. Transcendental knowledge has to be accepted by the descending process of disciplic succession as Brahm&#257; presents the knowledge of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;.</span> <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> is <span class="Italic">vij&ntilde;&#257;na</span> as realized by Brahm&#257;&rsquo;s transcendental experience, and in that way he presented the form and the pastimes of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in the transcendental abode. <span class="Italic">Aj&ntilde;&#257;na-bhid&#257;</span> means &ldquo;that which can match all kinds of speculation.&rdquo; In ignorance, people are imagining the form of the Lord; sometimes He has no form and sometimes He has form, according to their different imaginations. But the presentation of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> is <span class="Italic">vij&ntilde;&#257;na</span>&mdash;scientific, experienced knowledge given by Lord Brahm&#257; and accepted by Lord Caitanya. There is no doubt about it. &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s form, &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s flute, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s color&mdash;everything is reality. Here it is said that this <span class="Italic">vij&ntilde;&#257;nam</span> is always defeating all kinds of speculative knowledge. &ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo; the demigods prayed, &ldquo;without Your appearing as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, as You are, neither <span class="Italic">aj&ntilde;&#257;na-bhid&#257;</span> (the nescience of speculative knowledge) nor <span class="Italic">vij&ntilde;&#257;nam</span> would be realized. <span class="Italic">Aj&ntilde;&#257;na-bhid&#257;pam&#257;rjanam</span>&mdash;by Your appearance the speculative knowledge of ignorance will be vanquished, and the real, experienced knowledge of authorities like Lord Brahm&#257; will be established. Men influenced by the three modes of material nature imagine their own God according to the modes of material nature. In this way God is presented in various ways, but Your appearance will establish what the real form of God is.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">The highest blunder committed by the impersonalist is to think that when the incarnation of God comes, He accepts a form of matter in the mode of goodness. Actually the form of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a or N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a is transcendental to any material idea. Even the greatest impersonalist, &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya, has admitted, <span class="Italic">n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a&#7717; paro &rsquo;vyakt&#257;t:</span> the material creation is caused by the <span class="Italic">avyakta,</span> the impersonal manifestation of matter or the nonphenomenal total reservoir of matter, and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is transcendental to that material conception. This is expressed in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> as <span class="Italic">&#347;uddha-sattva,</span> or transcendental. The Lord does not belong to the material mode of goodness, for He is above the position of material goodness. He belongs to the transcendental, eternal status of bliss and knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purport">&ldquo;Dear Lord,&rdquo; the demigods prayed, &ldquo;when You appear in Your different incarnations, You take different names and forms according to different situations. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is Your name because You are all-attractive; You are called &#346;y&#257;masundara because of Your transcendental beauty. <span class="Italic">&#346;y&#257;ma</span> means blackish, yet they say that You are more beautiful than thousands of cupids. <span class="Italic">Kandarpa-ko&#7789;i-kaman&#299;ya.</span> Although You appear in a color which is compared to that of a blackish cloud, You are the transcendental Absolute, and therefore Your beauty is many, many times more attractive than the delicate body of Cupid. Sometimes You are called Giridh&#257;r&#299; because You lifted the hill known as Govardhana. You are sometimes called Nanda-nandana or V&#257;sudeva or Devak&#299;-nandana because You appear as the son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Nanda or Devak&#299; or Vasudeva. Impersonalists think that Your many names or forms are according to a particular type of work and quality because they accept You from the position of a material observer.</div>
<div class="Purport">&ldquo;Our dear Lord, the way of understanding is not to study Your absolute nature, form and activities by mental speculation. One must engage himself in devotional service; then one can understand Your absolute nature and Your transcendental form, name and quality. Actually, only a person who has a little taste for the service of Your lotus feet can understand Your transcendental nature or form and quality. Others may go on speculating for millions of years, but it is not possible for them to understand even a single part of Your actual position.&rdquo; In other words, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, cannot be understood by the nondevotees because there is a curtain of <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;</span> which covers K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s actual features. As confirmed in the <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index109a.html?g=2685">7.25</a>), <span class="Italic">n&#257;ha&#7745; prak&#257;&#347;a&#7717; sarvasya.</span> The Lord says, &ldquo;I am not exposed to anyone and everyone.&rdquo; When K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a came, He was actually present on the battlefield of Kuruk&#7779;etra, and everyone saw Him. But not everyone could understand that He was the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Still, everyone who died in His presence attained complete liberation from material bondage and was transferred to the spiritual world.</div>
<div class="Purport">Because foolish <span class="Italic">m&#363;&#7693;has</span> do not awaken their spiritual nature, they do not understand K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a or R&#257;ma (<span class="Italic">avaj&#257;nanti m&#257;&#7745; m&#363;&#7693;h&#257; m&#257;nu&#7779;&#299;&#7745; tanum &#257;&#347;ritam</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexa12b.html?g=3084">9.11</a>]). Even big academic scholars, not considering the endeavors of the <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> who have recommended devotional service in many elaborate commentaries and notes, think that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is fictitious. This is due to a lack of transcendental knowledge and a failure to awaken K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. One should have the common sense to ask why, if K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a or R&#257;ma were fictitious, stalwart scholars like &#346;r&#299;dhara Sv&#257;m&#299;, R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299;, San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299;, V&#299;rar&#257;ghava, Vijayadhvaja, Vallabh&#257;c&#257;rya and many other recognized <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> would have spent so much time to write about K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in notes and commentaries on <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span></div>

<div class="Purport">&ldquo;O Lord,&rdquo; the demigods say, &ldquo;the impersonalists, who are nondevotees, cannot understand that Your name is identical with Your form.&rdquo; Since the Lord is absolute, there is no difference between His name and His actual form.

One cannot taste the mango fruit simply by chanting, &ldquo;Mango, mango, mango.&rdquo; But the devotee who knows that there is no difference between the name and the form of the Lord chants Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare Hare/ Hare R&#257;ma, Hare R&#257;ma, R&#257;ma R&#257;ma, Hare Hare, and realizes that he is always in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s company.</div>

Since there is no difference between the transcendental name and form of the Lord, there is no difference between the transcendental pastimes and the form of the Lord. For those who are less intelligent (like women, laborers or the mercantile class), the great sage Vy&#257;sadeva wrote <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata,</span> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is present in His different activities. <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> is history, and simply by studying, hearing, and memorizing the transcendental activities of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the less intelligent can also gradually rise to the standard of pure devotees.</div>

This is the difference between a devotee and a nondevotee. Nondevotees cannot give any nomenclature for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, yet the Lord is known as &#346;y&#257;masundara and Giridh&#257;r&#299;. Similarly, the Lord is known as Devak&#299;-nandana and Ya&#347;od&#257;-nandana because He accepted the role of son for mother Devak&#299; and mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, and He is known as Gop&#257;la because He enjoyed the sport of maintaining the cows and calves. Therefore, although He has no mundane name, He is addressed by devotees as Devak&#299;-nandana, Ya&#347;od&#257;-nandana, Gop&#257;la and &#346;y&#257;masundara. These are all transcendental names that only devotees can appreciate and nondevotees cannot.</div>
<div class="Purport">The history of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a the person has been openly seen by everyone, yet only those who are in love with the Supreme Personality of Godhead can appreciate this history, whereas nondevotees, who have not developed their loving qualities, think that the activities, form and attributes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are fictitious. Therefore this verse explains, <span class="Italic">na n&#257;ma-r&#363;pe gu&#7751;a janma-karmabhir nir&#363;pitavye tava tasya s&#257;k&#7779;i&#7751;a&#7717;.</span> In this connection, &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura has given the example that persons suffering from jaundice cannot taste the sweetness of sugar candy, although everyone knows that sugar candy is sweet. Similarly, because of the material disease, nondevotees cannot understand the transcendental name, form, attributes and activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although they actually see the Lord&rsquo;s activities, either through authority or through history. The <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> are old, authentic histories, but nondevotees cannot understand them, especially <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> which is the essence of Vedic knowledge. Nondevotees cannot understand even the preliminary study of transcendental knowledge, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> They simply speculate and present commentaries with absurd distortions. In conclusion, unless one elevates himself to the transcendental platform by practicing <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> one cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His name, form, attributes or activities. But if by chance, by the association of devotees, one can actually understand the Lord and His features, one immediately becomes a liberated person. As the Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexe89d.html?g=1505">4.9</a>):</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">How <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> can be practiced is explained in this verse. &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; has said that anyone who has dedicated his life to the service of the Lord (<span class="Italic">&#299;h&#257; yasya harer d&#257;sye</span>) by his activities, his mind and his words (<span class="Italic">karma&#7751;&#257; manas&#257; gir&#257;</span>) may stay in any condition of life (<span class="Italic">nikhil&#257;sv apy avasth&#257;su</span>) and yet is no longer actually conditioned but is liberated (<span class="Italic">j&#299;van-mukta&#7717; sa ucyate</span>). Even though such a devotee is in a material body, he has nothing to do with this body, for he is transcendentally situated. <span class="Italic">N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a-par&#257;&#7717; sarve na kuta&#347;cana bibhyati:</span> because a devotee is engaged in transcendental activities, he is not afraid of being materially embodied. (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="indexb5dd.html?g=52522">6.17.28</a>) Illustrating this liberated position, &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu prayed, <span class="Italic">mama janmani janman&#299;&#347;vare bhavat&#257;d bhaktir ahaituk&#299; tvayi:</span> &ldquo;All I want is Your causeless devotional service in My life, birth after birth.&rdquo; (<span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;ik&#7779;&#257;&#7779;&#7789;aka</span> 4) Even if a devotee, by the supreme will of the Lord, takes birth in this material world, he continues his devotional service. When King Bharata made a mistake and in his next life became a deer, his devotional service did not stop, although some slight chastisement was given to him because of his negligence. N&#257;rada Muni says that even if one falls from the platform of devotional service, he is not lost, whereas nondevotees are lost entirely because they are not engaged in service. <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index6a3d.html?g=3111">9.14</a>) therefore recommends that one always engage at least in chanting the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra:</span></div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">satata&#7745; k&#299;rtayanto m&#257;&#7745;<br>yatanta&#347; ca d&#7771;&#7693;ha-vrat&#257;&#7717;<br>namasyanta&#347; ca m&#257;&#7745; bhakty&#257;<br>nitya-yukt&#257; up&#257;sate</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Always chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing down before Me, the great souls perpetually worship Me with devotion.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">One should not give up the process of devotional service, which is performed in nine different ways (<span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;a&#7745; k&#299;rtana&#7745; vi&#7779;&#7751;o&#7717; smara&#7751;a&#7745; p&#257;da-sevanam,</span> etc.<span class="Italic"> </I>[SB </span></I><a href="indexda76.html?g=55355">7.5.23</a>]). The most important process is hearing (<span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;am</span>) from the <span class="Italic">guru, s&#257;dhu</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra</span>&mdash;the spiritual master, the saintly <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> and the Vedic literature. <span class="Italic">S&#257;dhu-&#347;&#257;stra-guru-v&#257;kya, cittete kariy&#257; aikya.</span> We should not hear the commentaries and explanations of nondevotees, for this is strictly forbidden by &#346;r&#299;la San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299;, who quotes from the <span class="Italic">Padma Pur&#257;&#7751;a:</span></div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">avai&#7779;&#7751;ava-mukhodg&#299;r&#7751;a&#7745;<br>p&#363;ta&#7745; hari-kath&#257;m&#7771;tam<br>&#347;rava&#7751;a&#7745; naiva kartavya&#7745;<br>sarpocchi&#7779;&#7789;a&#7745; yath&#257; paya&#7717;</div>

<div class="After-Verse">We should strictly follow this injunction and never try to hear from M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s, impersonalists, voidists, politicians or so-called scholars. Strictly avoiding such inauspicious association, we should simply hear from pure devotees. &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; therefore recommends, <span class="Italic">&#347;r&#299;-guru-pad&#257;&#347;raya&#7717;:</span> one must seek shelter at the lotus feet of a pure devotee who can be one&rsquo;s <span class="Italic">guru.</span> Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu advises that a <span class="Italic">guru</span> is one who strictly follows the instructions of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;:</span> <span class="Italic">yare dekha, tare kaha, &lsquo;k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;&mdash;upade&#347;a</span> (Cc. <span class="Ref_Italic">Madhya</span> <a href="index89c7.html?g=104673">7.128</a>). A juggler, a magician or one who speaks nonsense as an academic career is not a <span class="Italic">guru.</span> Rather, a <span class="Italic">guru</span> is one who presents <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s instructions, as it is. <span class="Italic">&#346;rava&#7751;a</span> is very important; one must hear from the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhu, guru</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">kriy&#257;su,</span> meaning &ldquo;by manual labor&rdquo; or &ldquo;by work,&rdquo; is important in this verse. One should engage in practical service to the Lord. In our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, all our activities are concentrated upon distributing K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a literature. This is very important. One may approach any person and induce him to read K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a literature so that in the future he also may become a devotee. Such activities are recommended in this verse. <span class="Italic">Kriy&#257;su yas tvac-cara&#7751;&#257;ravindayo&#7717;.</span> Such activities will always remind the devotees of the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet. By fully concentrating on distributing books for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, one is fully absorbed in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. This is <span class="Italic">sam&#257;dhi.</span></div>

<div class="Translation">O Lord, we are fortunate because the heavy burden of the demons upon this earth is immediately removed by Your appearance.

<div class="First">The soles of the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet are marked with <span class="Italic">&#347;a&#7749;kha-cakra-gad&#257;-padma</span>&mdash;conchshell, disc, club and lotus&mdash;and also by a flag and a thunderbolt. When K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a walks on this earth or in the heavenly planets, these marks are visible wherever He goes. V&#7771;nd&#257;vana-dh&#257;ma is a transcendental place because of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s walking on this land frequently. The inhabitants of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana were fortunate to see these marks here and there. When Akr&#363;ra went to V&#7771;nd&#257;vana to take K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and Balar&#257;ma away to the festival arranged by Ka&#7745;sa, upon seeing the marks of the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet on the ground of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, he fell down and began to groan. These marks are visible to devotees who receive the causeless mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (<span class="Italic">tav&#257;nukampit&#257;m</span>). The demigods were jubilant not only because the appearance of the Supreme Lord would do away with the burdensome demons, but also because they would be able to see upon the ground the transcendental marks from the soles of the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet. The <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> always thought of the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet when He was walking in the pasturing grounds, and, as described in the previous verse, simply by thinking of the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet, the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> were fully absorbed in transcendence (<span class="Italic">&#257;vi&#7779;&#7789;a-cet&#257; na bhav&#257;ya kalpate</span>).

<div class="Translation">O Supreme Lord, You are not an ordinary living entity appearing in this material world as a result of fruitive activities.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index6669.html?g=4886">15.7</a>), <span class="Italic">mamaiv&#257;&#7745;&#347;o j&#299;va-loke j&#299;va-bh&#363;ta&#7717; san&#257;tana&#7717;:</span> the living entities are parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, and thus they are qualitatively one with the Lord. We can understand that when the Supreme Lord appears or disappears as an incarnation, there is no other cause than His pleasure potency. We cannot force the Supreme Personality of Godhead to appear. As He says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexd622.html?g=1487">4.7</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">yad&#257; yad&#257; hi dharmasya<br>gl&#257;nir bhavati bh&#257;rata<br>abhyutth&#257;nam adharmasya<br>tad&#257;tm&#257;na&#7745; s&#7771;j&#257;my aham</div>
</div><A NAME="122306"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion&mdash;at that time I descend Myself.&rdquo; When there is a need to diminish a burden created by the demons, the Supreme Godhead can do it in many ways because He has multifarious energies. There is no need for Him to come as an incarnation, since He is not forced to do anything like ordinary living entities. The living entities come to this material world in the spirit of enjoyment, but because they want to enjoy without K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (<span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-bahirmukha haiy&#257; bhoja-v&#257;&ntilde;ch&#257; kare</span>), they suffer birth, death, old age and disease under the control of the illusory energy. When the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears, however, no such causes are involved; His descent is an act of His pleasure potency. We should always remember this distinction between the Lord and the ordinary living entity and not uselessly argue that the Lord cannot come. There are philosophers who do not believe in the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation and who ask, &ldquo;Why should the Supreme Lord come?&rdquo; But the answer is, &ldquo;Why should He not come? Why should He be controlled by the desire of the living entity?&rdquo; The Lord is free to do whatever He likes. Therefore this verse says, <span class="Italic">vin&#257; vinoda&#7745; bata tarkay&#257;mahe.</span> It is only for His pleasure that He comes although He does not need to come.</div>
<div class="Purport">When the living entities come to this world for material enjoyment, they are entangled in <span class="Italic">karma</span> and <span class="Italic">karma-phala</span> by the Lord&rsquo;s illusory energy. But if one seeks shelter at the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet, one is again situated in his original, liberated state. As stated here, <span class="Italic">k&#7771;t&#257; yatas tvayy abhay&#257;&#347;ray&#257;tmani:</span> one who seeks shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord is always fearless. Because we are dependent on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we should give up the idea that without K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a we can enjoy freedom in this material world. This idea is the reason we have become entangled. Now it is our duty to seek shelter again at the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet. This shelter is described as <span class="Italic">abhaya,</span> or fearless. Since K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is not subject to birth, death, old age or disease, and since we are part and parcel of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, we also are not subject to birth, death, old age and disease, but we have become subject to these illusory problems because of our forgetfulness of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and our position as His eternal servants (<span class="Italic">j&#299;vera &lsquo;svar&#363;pa&rsquo; haya&mdash;k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;era &lsquo;nitya-d&#257;sa</span>&rsquo;<span class="Italic"> </I>[</span></I>Cc. <span class="Ref_Italic">Madhya</span> <a href="indexf61a.html?g=125576">20.108</a>]). Therefore, if we practice devotional service by always thinking of the Lord, always glorifying Him and always chanting about Him, as described in text 37 (<span class="Italic">&#347;&#7771;&#7751;van g&#7771;&#7751;an sa&#7745;smaraya&#7745;&#347; ca cintayan</span>), we will be reinstated in our original, constitutional position and thus be saved. The demigods, therefore, encouraged Devak&#299; not to fear Ka&#7745;sa, but to think of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who was already within her womb.</div>

He replies that there is no contradiction. From the heart the Lord can go to the womb, or from the womb He can go to the heart. Indeed, He can go or stay anywhere. As confirmed in the <span class="Ref_Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> (5.35), <span class="Italic">a&#7751;&#7693;&#257;ntara-stha-param&#257;&#7751;u-cay&#257;ntara-stha&#7745; govindam &#257;di-puru&#7779;a&#7745; tam aha&#7745; bhaj&#257;mi.</span> The Lord can stay wherever He likes.

Because they were afraid of Ka&#7745;sa, when the Lord appeared as an ordinary child they took Him to Gokula, the home of Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Mother Devak&#299;, being fully transcendental, <span class="Italic">sac-cid-&#257;nanda,</span> does not belong to this material world. Thus the Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared with four hands, as if born from her womb. Upon seeing the Lord in that Vi&#7779;&#7751;u form, Vasudeva was struck with wonder, and in transcendental happiness he and Devak&#299; mentally gave ten thousand cows in charity to the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> Vasudeva then offered prayers to the Lord, addressing Him as the Supreme Person, Parabrahman, the Supersoul, who is beyond duality and who is internally and externally all-pervading. The Lord, the cause of all causes, is beyond material existence, although He is the creator of this material world. When He enters this world as Param&#257;tm&#257;, He is all-pervading (<span class="Italic">a&#7751;&#7693;&#257;ntara-stha-param&#257;&#7751;u-cay&#257;ntara-stham</span>), yet He is transcendentally situated.

Thus Vasudeva offered prayers full of meaning to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Devak&#299; followed her husband by offering prayers describing the transcendental nature of the Lord. Fearing Ka&#7745;sa and desiring that the Lord not be understood by atheistic and materialistic nondevotees, she prayed that the Lord withdraw His transcendental four-armed form and appear like an ordinary child with two hands.</div>
</div><A NAME="122359"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The Lord reminded Vasudeva and Devak&#299; of two other incarnations in which He had appeared as their son. He had appeared as P&#7771;&#347;nigarbha and V&#257;manadeva, and now this was the third time He was appearing as the son of Devak&#299; to fulfill their desire. The Lord then decided to leave the residence of Vasudeva and Devak&#299;, in the prison house of Ka&#7745;sa, and at this very time, Yogam&#257;y&#257; took birth as the daughter of Ya&#347;od&#257;. By the arrangement of Yogam&#257;y&#257;, Vasudeva was able to leave the prison house and save the child from the hands of Ka&#7745;sa. When Vasudeva brought K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a to the house of Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, he saw that by Yogam&#257;y&#257;&rsquo;s arrangement, Ya&#347;od&#257;, as well as everyone else, was deeply asleep. Thus he exchanged the babies, taking Yogam&#257;y&#257; from Ya&#347;od&#257;&rsquo;s lap and placing K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a there instead. Then Vasudeva returned to his own place, having taken Yogam&#257;y&#257; as his daughter. He placed Yogam&#257;y&#257; on Devak&#299;&rsquo;s bed and prepared to be a prisoner as before. In Gokula, Ya&#347;od&#257; could not understand whether she had given birth to a male or a female child.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Thereafter, at the auspicious time for the appearance of the Lord, the entire universe was surcharged with all the qualities of goodness, beauty and peace. The constellation Rohi&#7751;&#299; appeared, as did stars like A&#347;vin&#299;. The sun, the moon and the other stars and planets were very peaceful. All directions appeared extremely pleasing, and the beautiful stars twinkled in the cloudless sky. Decorated with towns, villages, mines and pasturing grounds, the earth seemed all-auspicious. The rivers flowed with clear water, and the lakes and vast reservoirs, full of lilies and lotuses, were extraordinarily beautiful. In the trees and green plants, full of flowers and leaves, pleasing to the eyes, birds like cuckoos and swarms of bees began chanting with sweet voices for the sake of the demigods. A pure breeze began to blow, pleasing the sense of touch and bearing the aroma of flowers, and when the br&#257;hma&#7751;as engaging in ritualistic ceremonies ignited their fires according to Vedic principles, the fires burned steadily, undisturbed by the breeze. Thus when the birthless Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was about to appear, the saints and br&#257;hma&#7751;as, who had always been disturbed by demons like Ka&#7745;sa and his men, felt peace within the core of their hearts, and kettledrums simultaneously vibrated from the upper planetary system.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">As stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> the Lord says that His appearance, birth, and activities are all transcendental and that one who factually understands them is immediately eligible to be transferred to the spiritual world. The Lord&rsquo;s appearance or birth is not like that of an ordinary man, who is forced to accept a material body according to his past deeds. The Lord&rsquo;s appearance is explained in the previous chapter: He appears out of His own sweet pleasure.</div>
<div class="Purport">When the time was mature for the appearance of the Lord, the constellations became very auspicious. The astrological influence of the constellation known as Rohi&#7751;&#299; was also predominant because this constellation is considered very auspicious. Rohi&#7751;&#299; is under the direct supervision of Brahm&#257;, who is born of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and it appears at the birth of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, who in fact is birthless. According to the astrological conclusion, besides the proper situation of the stars, there are auspicious and inauspicious moments due to the different situations of the different planetary systems. At the time of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s birth, the planetary systems were automatically adjusted so that everything became auspicious.</div>
<div class="Purport">At that time, in all directions, east, west, south, north, everywhere, there was an atmosphere of peace and prosperity. Auspicious stars were visible in the sky, and on the surface in all towns and villages or pasturing grounds and within the mind of everyone there were signs of good fortune. The rivers were flowing full of water, and the lakes were beautifully decorated with lotus flowers. The forests were full with beautiful birds and peacocks. All the birds within the forests began to sing with sweet voices, and the peacocks began to dance with their consorts. The wind blew very pleasantly, carrying the aroma of different flowers, and the sensation of bodily touch was very pleasing. At home, the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> who were accustomed to offer sacrifices in the fire, found their homes very pleasant for offerings. Because of disturbances created by the demoniac kings, the sacrificial fire had been almost stopped in the houses of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> but now they could find the opportunity to start the fire peacefully. Being forbidden to offer sacrifices, the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> were very distressed in mind, intelligence and activities. But just on the point of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s appearance, automatically their minds became full of joy because they could hear loud vibrations in the sky of transcendental sounds proclaiming the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purport">On the occasion of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s birth, seasonal changes took place throughout the entire universe. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was born during the month of September, yet it appeared like springtime. The atmosphere, however, was very cool, although not chilly, and the rivers and reservoirs appeared just as they would in <span class="Italic">&#347;arat,</span> the fall. Lotuses and lilies blossom during the day, but although K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appeared at twelve o&rsquo;clock midnight, the lilies and lotuses were in bloom, and thus the wind blowing at that time was full of fragrance. Because of Ka&#7745;sa&rsquo;s disturbances, the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies had almost stopped. The <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and saintly persons could not execute the Vedic rituals with peaceful minds. But now the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> were very pleased to perform their daily ritualistic ceremonies undisturbed. The business of the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> is to disturb the <span class="Italic">suras,</span> the devotees and <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> but at the time of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s appearance these devotees and <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> were undisturbed.</div>

Then the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, who is situated in the core of everyone&rsquo;s heart, appeared from the heart of Devak&#299; in the dense darkness of night, like the full moon rising on the eastern horizon, because Devak&#299; was of the same category as &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">As stated in the <span class="Ref_Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> (5.37):</div>

<div class="After-Verse">This verse indicates that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and His entourage are of the same spiritual potency (<span class="Italic">&#257;nanda-cinmaya-rasa</span>). K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s father, His mother, His friends the cowherd boys, and the cows are all expansions of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, as will be explained in the <span class="Italic">brahma-vimohana-l&#299;l&#257;.</span> When Brahm&#257; took away K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s associates to test the supremacy of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Lord expanded Himself again in the forms of the many cowherd boys and calves, all of whom, as Brahm&#257; saw, were <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-m&#363;rtis.</span> Devak&#299; is also an expansion of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and therefore this verse says, <span class="Italic">devaky&#257;&#7745; deva-r&#363;pi&#7751;y&#257;&#7745; vi&#7779;&#7751;u&#7717; sarva-guh&#257;-&#347;aya&#7717;.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">At the time for the Lord&rsquo;s appearance, the great sages and the demigods, being pleased, began to shower flowers. At the seashore, there was the sound of mild waves, and above the sea there were clouds in the sky which began to thunder very pleasingly.</div>
<div class="Purport">When things were adjusted like this, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, who is residing within the heart of every living entity, appeared in the darkness of night as the Supreme Personality of Godhead before Devak&#299;, who appeared as one of the demigoddesses. The appearance of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u at that time could be compared to the rising of the full moon in the sky on the eastern horizon. The objection may be raised that since Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appeared on the eighth day of the waning moon, there could be no rising of the full moon. In answer to this it may be said that Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appeared in the dynasty which is in the hierarchy of the moon; therefore, although the moon was incomplete on that night, because of the Lord&rsquo;s appearance in the dynasty wherein the moon is himself the original person, the moon was in an overjoyous condition, so by the grace of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a he could appear as a full moon. To welcome the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the waning moon became a full moon in jubilation.</div>
<div class="Purport">Instead of <span class="Italic">deva-r&#363;pi&#7751;y&#257;m,</span> some texts of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> clearly say <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-r&#363;pi&#7751;y&#257;m.</span> In either case, the meaning is that Devak&#299; has the same spiritual form as the Lord. The Lord is <span class="Italic">sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha</span><I> <span class="Italic"></I>[</I>Bs. </span>5.1</I>]<span class="Italic"></I>,</span> and Devak&#299; is also <span class="Italic">sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha.</span> Therefore no one can find any fault in the way the Supreme Personality of Godhead, <span class="Italic">sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha,</span> appeared from the womb of Devak&#299;.</div>
<div class="Purport">Those who are not in full knowledge that the appearance and disappearance of the Lord are transcendental (<span class="Italic">janma karma ca me divyam</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexe89d.html?g=1505">4.9</a>]) are sometimes surprised that the Supreme Personality of Godhead can take birth like an ordinary child. Actually, however, the Lord&rsquo;s birth is never ordinary. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is already situated within the core of everyone&rsquo;s heart as <span class="Italic">antary&#257;m&#299;,</span> the Supersoul. Thus because He was present in full potency in Devak&#299;&rsquo;s heart, He was also able to appear outside her body.</div>
<div class="Purport">One of the twelve great personalities is Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva (<span class="Italic">svayambh&#363;r n&#257;rada&#7717; &#347;ambhu&#7717; kum&#257;ra&#7717; kapilo manu&#7717; prahl&#257;da, janako bh&#299;&#7779;ma&#7717;</span> [SB <a href="index94f8.html?g=47678">6.3.20</a>]). In <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="indexac23.html?g=9394">1.9.42</a>), Bh&#299;&#7779;ma, a great authority to be followed by devotees, says that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in the core of everyone&rsquo;s heart, just as the sun may be on everyone&rsquo;s head. Yet although the sun may be on the heads of millions and millions of people, this does not mean that the sun is variously situated. Similarly, because the Supreme Personality of Godhead has inconceivable potencies, He can be within everyone&rsquo;s heart and yet not be situated variously. <span class="Italic">Ekatvam anupa&#347;yata&#7717;</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">&#298;&#347;opani&#7779;ad</span> 7). The Lord is one, but He can appear in everyone&rsquo;s heart by His inconceivable potency. Thus although the Lord was within the heart of Devak&#299;, He appeared as her child. According to the <span class="Italic">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u Pur&#257;&#7751;a,</span> therefore, as quoted in the <span class="Italic">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-to&#7779;a&#7751;&#299;,</span> the Lord appeared like the sun (<span class="Italic">anugrah&#257;saya</span>). The <span class="Ref_Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> (5.35) confirms that the Lord is situated even within the atom (<span class="Italic">a&#7751;&#7693;&#257;ntara-stha-param&#257;&#7751;u-cay&#257;ntara-stham</span>). He is situated in Mathur&#257;, in Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha and in the core of the heart. Therefore one should clearly understand that He did not live like an ordinary child in the heart or the womb of Devak&#299;. Nor did He appear like an ordinary human child, although He seemed to do so in order to bewilder <span class="Italic">asuras</span> like Ka&#7745;sa. I he <span class="Italic">asuras</span> wrongly think that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a took birth like an ordinary child and passed away from this world like an ordinary man. Such asuric conceptions are rejected by persons in knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">Ajo &rsquo;pi sann avyay&#257;tm&#257; bh&#363;t&#257;n&#257;m &#299;&#347;varo &rsquo;pi san</span> (Bg. <a href="index333e.html?g=1478">4.6</a>). As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> the Lord is <span class="Italic">aja,</span> unborn, and He is the supreme controller of everything. Nonetheless, He appeared as the child of Devak&#299;. This verse describes the inconceivable potency of the Lord, who appeared like the full moon. Understanding the special significance of the appearance of the Supreme Godhead, one should never regard Him as having taken birth like an ordinary child.</div>

No ordinary child in human society has ever been born with four hands. And when is a child born with fully grown hair? The descent of the Lord, therefore, is completely distinct from the birth of an ordinary child. The Vaid&#363;rya gem, which sometimes appears bluish, sometimes yellow and sometimes red, is available in Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka.

<div class="Translation">When Vasudeva saw his extraordinary son, his eyes were struck with wonder. In transcendental jubilation, he mentally collected ten thousand cows and distributed them among the br&#257;hma&#7751;as as a transcendental festival.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura has analyzed the wonder of Vasudeva upon seeing his extraordinary child. Vasudeva was shivering with wonder to see a newborn child decorated so nicely with valuable garments and gems. He could immediately understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead had appeared, not as an ordinary child but in His original, fully decorated, four-handed form. The first wonder was that the Lord was not afraid to appear within the prison house of Ka&#7745;sa, where Vasudeva and Devak&#299; were interned. Second, although the Lord, the Supreme Transcendence, is all-pervading, He had appeared from the womb of Devak&#299;. The third point of wonder, therefore, was that a child could take birth from the womb so nicely decorated. Fourth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was Vasudeva&rsquo;s worshipable Deity yet had taken birth as his son. For all these reasons, Vasudeva was transcendentally jubilant, and he wanted to perform a festival, as <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> do to celebrate the birth of a child, but because of his imprisonment he was unable to do it externally, and therefore he performed the festival within his mind. This was just as good. If one cannot externally serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can serve the Lord within one&rsquo;s mind, since the activities of the mind are as good as those of the other senses. This is called the nondual or absolute situation (<span class="Italic">advaya j&ntilde;&#257;na</span>). People generally perform ritualistic ceremonies for the birth of a child. Why then should Vasudeva not have performed such a ceremony when the Supreme Lord appeared as his son?</div>

Then, when Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u inhales, all these <span class="Italic">brahm&#257;&#7751;&#7693;as</span> disappear. Thus the millions of <span class="Italic">brahm&#257;&#7751;&#7693;as</span> controlled by the Brahm&#257;s and other demigods come and go in this material world through the breathing of Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u.</div>
<div class="Purport">Foolish persons think that when K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appears as the son of Vasudeva, He is limited like an ordinary child. But Vasudeva was aware that although the Lord had appeared as his son, the Lord had not entered Devak&#299;&rsquo;s womb and then come out. Rather, the Lord was always there. The Supreme Lord is all-pervading, present within and without. <span class="Italic">pravi&#7779;&#7789;a iva bh&#257;vyase:</span> He only seemed to have entered the womb of Devak&#299; and to have now appeared as Vasudeva&rsquo;s child. The expression of this knowledge by Vasudeva indicates that Vasudeva knew how these events took place. Vasudeva was certainly a devotee of the Lord in full knowledge, and we must learn from devotees like him. <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexc9da.html?g=1729">4.34</a>) therefore recommends:</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.&rdquo; Vasudeva begot the Supreme Personality of Godhead, yet he was in full knowledge of how the Supreme Lord appears and disappears. He was therefore <span class="Italic">tattva-dar&#347;&#299;,</span> a seer of the truth, because he personally saw how the Supreme Absolute Truth appeared as his son. Vasudeva was not in ignorance, thinking that because the Supreme Godhead had appeared as his son, the Lord had become limited. The Lord is unlimitedly existing and all-pervading, inside and outside. Thus there is no question of His appearance or disappearance.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">The mahat-tattva, the total material energy, is undivided, but because of the material modes of nature, it appears to separate into earth, water, fire, air and ether. Because of the living energy [j&#299;va-bh&#363;ta], these separated energies combine to make the cosmic manifestation visible, but in fact, before the creation of the cosmos, the total energy is already present. Therefore, the total material energy never actually enters the creation. Similarly, although You are perceived by our senses because of Your presence, You cannot be perceived by the senses, nor experienced by the mind or words [av&#257;&#7749;-m&#257;nasa-gocara]. With our senses we can perceive some things, but not everything; for example, we can use our eyes to see, but not to taste. Consequently, You are beyond perception by the senses. Although in touch with the modes of material nature, You are unaffected by them. You are the prime factor in everything, the all-pervading, undivided Supersoul. For You, therefore, there is no external or internal. You never entered the womb of Devak&#299;; rather, You existed there already.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This same understanding is explained by the Lord Himself in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexa3fb.html?g=3021">9.4</a>):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">may&#257; tatam ida&#7745; sarva&#7745;<br>jagad-avyakta-m&#363;rtin&#257;<br>mat-sth&#257;ni sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;ni<br>na c&#257;ha&#7745; te&#7779;v avasthita&#7717;</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not perceivable through the gross material senses. It is said that Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s name, fame, pastimes, etc., cannot be understood by material senses. Only to one who is engaged in pure devotional service under proper guidance is He revealed. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> (5.38):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">prem&#257;&ntilde;jana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena<br>santa&#7717; sadaiva h&#7771;daye&#7779;u vilokayanti</div>
</div><A NAME="122535"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">One can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, always, within oneself and outside oneself, if one has developed the transcendental loving attitude toward Him. Thus for people in general, He is not visible. In the above-mentioned verse from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> therefore, it is said that although He is all-pervading, everywhere present, He is not conceivable by the material senses. But actually, although we cannot see Him, everything is resting in Him. As discussed in the Seventh Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> the entire material cosmic manifestation is only a combination of His two different energies, the superior, spiritual energy and the inferior, material energy. Just as the sunshine is spread all over the universe, the energy of the Lord is spread all over the creation, and everything is resting in that energy.</div>
<div class="Purport">Yet one should not conclude that because He is spread all over He has lost His personal existence. To refute such arguments, the Lord says, &ldquo;I am everywhere, and everything is in Me, but still I am aloof.&rdquo; For example, a king heads a government which is but the manifestation of the king&rsquo;s energy; the different governmental departments are nothing but the energies of the king, and each department is resting on the king&rsquo;s power. But still one cannot expect the king to be present in every department personally. That is a crude example. Similarly, all the manifestations that we see, and everything that exists, both in this material world and in the spiritual world, are resting on the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The creation takes place by the diffusion of His different energies, and, as stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> He is everywhere present by His personal representation, the diffusion of His different energies.</div>
<div class="Purport">One may argue that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who creates the whole cosmic manifestation simply by His glance, cannot come within the womb of Devak&#299;, the wife of Vasudeva. To eradicate this argument, Vasudeva said, &ldquo;My dear Lord, it is not very wonderful that You appeared within the womb of Devak&#299;, for the creation was also made in that way. You were lying in the Causal Ocean as Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and by Your breathing, innumerable universes came into existence. Then You entered into each of the universes as Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Then again You expanded Yourself as K&#7779;&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and entered into the heart of all living entities and entered even within the atoms. Therefore Your entrance into the womb of Devak&#299; is understandable in the same way. You appear to have entered, but You are simultaneously all-pervading. We can understand Your entrance and nonentrance from material examples. The total material energy remains intact even after being divided into sixteen elements. The material body is nothing but a combination of the five gross elements&mdash;namely earth, water, fire, air and ether. Whenever there is a material body, it appears that such elements are newly created, but actually the elements are always existing outside of the body. Similarly, although You appear as a child in the womb of Devak&#299;, You are also existing outside. You are always in Your abode, but still You can simultaneously expand Yourself into millions of forms.</div>
<div class="Purport">&ldquo;One has to understand Your appearance with great intelligence because the material energy is also emanating from You. You are the original source of the material energy, just as the sun is the source of the sunshine. The sunshine cannot cover the sun globe, nor can the material energy&mdash;being an emanation from You&mdash;cover You. You appear to be in the three modes of material energy, but actually the three modes of material energy cannot cover You. This is understood by the highly intellectual philosophers. In other words, although You appear to be within the material energy, You are never covered by it.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">We hear from the Vedic version that the Supreme Brahman exhibits His effulgence and therefore everything is illuminated. We can understand from <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> that the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti,</span> or the Brahman effulgence, emanates from the body of the Supreme Lord. And from the Brahman effulgence, all creation takes place. It is further stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> that the Lord is the support of the Brahman effulgence. Originally He is the root cause of everything. But persons who are less intelligent think that when the Supreme Personality of Godhead comes within this material world, He accepts material qualities. Such conclusions are not mature, but are, made by the less intelligent.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">One who considers his visible body, which is a product of the three modes of nature, to be independent of the soul is unaware of the basis of existence, and therefore he is a rascal. Those who are learned have rejected his conclusion because one can understand through full discussion that with no basis in soul, the visible body and senses would be insubstantial. Nonetheless, although his conclusion has been rejected, a foolish person considers it a reality.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Without the basic principle of soul, the body cannot be produced. So-called scientists have tried in many ways to produce a living body in their chemical laboratories, but no one has been able to do it because unless the spirit soul is present, a body cannot be prepared from material elements. Since scientists are now enamored of theories about the chemical composition of the body, we have challenged many scientists to make even a small egg. The chemicals in eggs can be found very easily. There is a white substance and a yellow substance, covered by a shell, and modern scientists should very easily be able to duplicate all this. But even if they were to prepare such an egg and put it in an incubator, this man-made chemical egg would not produce a chicken. The soul must be added because there is no question of a chemical combination for life. Those who think that life can exist without the soul have therefore been described here as <span class="Italic">abudha&#7717;,</span> foolish rascals.</div>
<div class="Purport">Again, there are those who reject the body, regarding it as insubstantial. They are of the same category of fools. One can neither reject the body nor accept it as substantial. The substance is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and both the body and the soul are energies of the Supreme Godhead, as described by the Lord Himself in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index7379.html?g=2496">7.4</a>&ndash;5):</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">bh&#363;mir &#257;po &rsquo;nalo v&#257;yu&#7717;<br>kha&#7745; mano buddhir eva ca<br>aha&#7749;k&#257;ra it&#299;ya&#7745; me<br>bhinn&#257; prak&#7771;tir a&#7779;&#7789;adh&#257;</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego&mdash;all together these eight comprise My separated material energies. But besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine, which consists of all living entities who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">The body, therefore, has a relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just as the soul does. Since both of them are energies of the Lord, neither of them is false, because they come from the reality. One who does not know this secret of life is described as <span class="Italic">abudha&#7717;.</span> According to the Vedic injunctions, <span class="Italic">aitad&#257;tmyam ida&#7745; sarvam, sarva&#7745; khalv ida&#7745; brahma:</span> everything is the Supreme Brahman. Therefore, both the body and the soul are Brahman, since matter and spirit emanate from Brahman.</div>
<div class="Purport">Not knowing the conclusions of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> some people accept the material nature as substance, and others accept the spirit soul as substance, but actually Brahman is the substance. Brahman is the cause of all causes. The ingredients and the immediate cause of this manifested material world are Brahman, and we cannot make the ingredients of this world independent of Brahman. Furthermore, since the ingredients and the immediate cause of this material manifestation are Brahman, both of them are truth, <span class="Italic">satya;</span> there is no validity to the expression <span class="Italic">brahma satya&#7745; jagan mithy&#257;.</span> The world is not false.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">J&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s</span> reject this world, and foolish persons accept this world as reality, and in this way they are both misguided. Although the body is not as important as the soul, we cannot say that it is false. Yet the body is temporary, and only foolish, materialistic persons, who do not have full knowledge of the soul, regard the temporary body as reality and engage in decorating this body. Both of these pitfalls&mdash;rejection of the body as false and acceptance of the body as all in all&mdash;can be avoided when one is fully situated in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. If we regard this world as false, we fall into the category of <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> who say that this world is unreal, with no foundation and no God in control (<span class="Italic">asatyam aprati&#7779;&#7789;ha&#7745; te jagad &#257;hur an&#299;&#347;varam</span>). As described in the Sixteenth Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> this is the conclusion of demons.</div>

<div class="Translation">My Lord, Your form is transcendental to the three material modes, yet for the maintenance of the three worlds, You assume the white color of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u in goodness; for creation, which is surrounded by the quality of passion, You appear reddish; and at the end, when there is a need for annihilation, which is surrounded by ignorance, You appear blackish.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Vasudeva prayed to the Lord, &ldquo;You are called <span class="Italic">&#347;uklam.</span> <span class="Italic">&#346;uklam,</span> or &lsquo;whiteness,&rsquo; is the symbolic representation of the Absolute Truth because it is unaffected by the material qualities. Lord Brahm&#257; is called <span class="Italic">rakta,</span> or red, because Brahm&#257; represents the qualities of passion for creation. Darkness is entrusted to Lord &#346;iva because he annihilates the cosmos. The creation, annihilation and maintenance of this cosmic manifestation are conducted by Your potencies, yet You are always unaffected by those qualities.&rdquo; As confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Vedas, harir hi nirgu&#7751;a&#7717; s&#257;k&#7779;&#257;t:</span> the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always free from all material qualities. It is also said that the qualities of passion and ignorance are nonexistent in the person of the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="Purport">In this verse, the three colors mentioned&mdash;<span class="Italic">&#347;ukla, rakta</span> and <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</span>&mdash;are not to be understood literally, in terms of what we experience with our senses, but rather as representatives of <span class="Italic">sattva-gu&#7751;a, rajo-gu&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">tamo-gu&#7751;a.</span> After all, sometimes we see that a duck is white, although it is in <span class="Italic">tamo-gu&#7751;a,</span> the mode of ignorance. Illustrating the logic called <span class="Italic">bak&#257;ndha-ny&#257;ya,</span> the duck is such a fool that it runs after the testicles of a bull, thinking them to be a hanging fish that can be taken when it drops. Thus the duck is always in darkness. Vy&#257;sadeva, however, the compiler of the Vedic literature, is blackish, but this does not mean that he is in <span class="Italic">tamo-gu&#7751;a;</span> rather, he is in the highest position of <span class="Italic">sattva-gu&#7751;a,</span> beyond the material modes of nature. Sometimes these colors (<span class="Italic">&#347;ukla-raktas tath&#257; p&#299;ta&#7717;</span>) are used to designate the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as, k&#7779;atriyas, vai&#347;yas</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras.</span> Lord K&#7779;&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is celebrated as possessing a blackish color, Lord &#346;iva is whitish, and Lord Brahm&#257; is reddish, but according to &#346;r&#299;la San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299; in the <span class="Italic">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-to&#7779;a&#7751;&#299;-&#7789;&#299;k&#257;,</span> this exhibition of colors is not what is referred to here.</div>
<div class="Purport">The real understanding of <span class="Italic">&#347;ukla, rakta</span> and <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a</span> is as follows.

The entire world is now full of many <span class="Italic">asuras</span> in the guise of politicians, <span class="Italic">gurus, s&#257;dhus, yog&#299;s</span> and incarnations, and they are misleading the general public away from K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, which can offer true benefit to human society.</div>

<div class="Translation">O my Lord, Lord of the demigods, after hearing the prophecy that You would take birth in our home and kill him, this uncivilized Ka&#7745;sa killed so many of Your elder brothers. As soon as he hears from his lieutenants that You have appeared, he will immediately come with weapons to kill You.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Ka&#7745;sa has here been described as <span class="Italic">asabhya,</span> meaning &ldquo;uncivilized&rdquo; or &ldquo;most heinous,&rdquo; because he killed the many children of his sister. When he heard the prophecy that he would be killed by her eighth son, this uncivilized man, Ka&#7745;sa, was immediately ready to kill his innocent sister on the occasion of her marriage. An uncivilized man can do anything for the satisfaction of his senses. He can kill children, he can kill cows, he can kill <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> he can kill old men; he has no mercy for anyone. According to the Vedic civilization, cows, women, children, old men and <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> should be excused if they are at fault. But <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> uncivilized men, do not care about that. At the present moment, the killing of cows and the killing of children is going on unrestrictedly, and therefore this civilization is not at all human, and those who are conducting this condemned civilization are uncivilized <span class="Italic">asuras.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">Such uncivilized men are not in favor of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement. As public officers, they declare without hesitation that the chanting of the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a movement is a nuisance, although <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> clearly says, <span class="Italic">satata&#7745; k&#299;rtayanto m&#257;&#7745; yatanta&#347; ca d&#7771;&#7693;ha-vrat&#257;&#7717;</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index6a3d.html?g=3111">9.14</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> According to this verse, it is the duty of the <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;s</span> to chant the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra</span> and try to spread it all over the world to the best of their ability. Unfortunately, society is in such an uncivilized state that there are so-called <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;s</span> who are prepared to kill cows and children and stop the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a movement. Such uncivilized activities were actually demonstrated in opposition to the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a movement&rsquo;s Bombay center, Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Land. As Ka&#7745;sa was not expected to kill the beautiful child of Devak&#299; and Vasudeva, the uncivilized society, although unhappy about the advancement of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, cannot be expected to stop it. Yet we must face many difficulties in many different ways. Although K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a cannot be killed, Vasudeva, as the father of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, was trembling because in affection he thought that Ka&#7745;sa would immediately come and kill his son. Similarly, although the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a are not different and no <span class="Italic">asuras</span> can check it, we are afraid that at any moment the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> can stop this movement in any part of the world.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The word <span class="Italic">suvismit&#257;,</span> meaning &ldquo;astonished,&rdquo; is significant in this verse. Devak&#299; and her husband, Vasudeva, were assured that their child was the Supreme Personality of Godhead and could not be killed by Ka&#7745;sa, but because of affection, as they thought of Ka&#7745;sa&rsquo;s previous atrocities, they were simultaneously afraid that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a would be killed. This is why the word <span class="Italic">suvismit&#257;</span> has been used. Similarly, we are also astounded upon thinking of whether this movement will be killed by the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> or will continue to advance without fear.</div>

<div class="Translation">&#346;r&#299; Devak&#299; said: My dear Lord, there are different Vedas, some of which describe You as unperceivable through words and the mind. Yet You are the origin of the entire cosmic manifestation. You are Brahman, the greatest of everything, full of effulgence like the sun. You have no material cause, You are free from change and deviation, and You have no material desires. Thus the Vedas say that You are the substance. Therefore, my Lord, You are directly the origin of all Vedic statements, and by understanding You, one gradually understands everything. You are different from the light of Brahman and Param&#257;tm&#257;, yet You are not different from them. Everything emanates from You. Indeed, You are the cause of all causes, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the light of all transcendental knowledge.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is the origin of everything, and there is no difference between Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a because both of Them are <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-tattva.</span> From the <span class="Italic">&#7770;g Veda</span> we understand, <span class="Italic">o&#7745; tad vi&#7779;&#7751;o&#7717; parama&#7745; padam:</span> the original substance is the all-pervading Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, who is also Param&#257;tm&#257; and the effulgent Brahman. The living entities are also part and parcel of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, who has various energies (<span class="Italic">par&#257;sya &#347;aktir vividhaiva &#347;r&#363;yate sv&#257;bh&#257;vik&#299; j&ntilde;&#257;na-bala-kriy&#257; ca</span>). Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, is therefore everything. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says in the <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index58fa.html?g=3360">10.8</a>), <span class="Italic">aha&#7745; sarvasya prabhavo matta&#7717; sarva&#7745; pravartate:</span> &ldquo;I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me.&rdquo; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, therefore, is the original cause of everything (<span class="Italic">sarva-k&#257;ra&#7751;a-k&#257;ra&#7751;am</span> <span class="Italic"></I>[</I>Bs. </span>5.1</I>]</I>). When Vi&#7779;&#7751;u expands in His all-pervading aspect, we should understand Him to be the <span class="Italic">nir&#257;k&#257;ra-nirvi&#347;e&#7779;a-brahmajyoti.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">Although everything emanates from K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, He is ultimately a person. <span class="Italic">Aham &#257;dir hi dev&#257;n&#257;m:</span> He is the origin of Brahm&#257;, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and Mahe&#347;vara, and from them many other demigods are manifested. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a therefore says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index3746.html?g=4826">14.27</a>), <span class="Italic">brahma&#7751;o hi prati&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;ham;</span> &ldquo;Brahman rests upon Me.&rdquo; The Lord also says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">ye &rsquo;py anya-devat&#257;-bhakt&#257;<br>yajante &#347;raddhay&#257;nvit&#257;&#7717;<br>te &rsquo;pi m&#257;m eva kaunteya<br>yajanty avidhi-p&#363;rvakam</div>
</div><A NAME="122649"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Whatever a man may sacrifice to other gods, O son of Kunt&#299;, is really meant for Me alone, but it is offered without true understanding.&rdquo; (Bg. <a href="indexae45.html?g=3192">9.23</a>) There are many persons who worship different demigods, considering all of them to be separate gods, which in fact they are not. The fact is that every demigod, and every living entity, is part and parcel of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (<span class="Italic">mamaiv&#257;&#7745;&#347;o j&#299;va-loke j&#299;va-bh&#363;ta&#7717;</span>). The demigods are also in the category of living entities; they are not separate gods. But men whose knowledge is immature and contaminated by the modes of material nature worship various demigods, according to their intelligence. Therefore they are rebuked in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">k&#257;mais tais tair h&#7771;ta-j&ntilde;&#257;n&#257;&#7717; prapadyante &rsquo;nya-devat&#257;&#7717; </I>[Bg. </I></span><a href="indexda67.html?g=2640">7.20</a>]). Because they are unintelligent and not very advanced and have not properly considered the truth, they take to the worship of various demigods or speculate according to various philosophies, such as the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purport">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, is the actual origin of everything. As stated in the <span class="Italic">Vedas, yasya bh&#257;&#7779;&#257; sarvam ida&#7745; vibh&#257;ti.</span> The Absolute Truth is described later in the <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (10.28.15) as <span class="Italic">satya&#7745; j&ntilde;&#257;nam anantam yad brahma-jyoti&#7717; san&#257;tanam.</span> The <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> is <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana,</span> eternal, yet it is dependent on K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (<span class="Italic">brahma&#7751;o hi prati&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;ham</span>). The <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> states that the Lord is all-pervading. <span class="Italic">A&#7751;&#7693;&#257;ntara-stha-param&#257;&#7751;u-cay&#257;ntara-stham:</span> He is within this universe, and He is within the atom as Param&#257;tm&#257;. <span class="Italic">Yasya prabh&#257; prabhavato jagad-a&#7751;&#7693;a-ko&#7789;i-ko&#7789;i&#7779;v a&#347;e&#7779;a-vasudh&#257;di-vibhu-ti-bhinnam:</I> [Bs. </I></span>5.40] Brahman is also not independent of Him. Therefore whatever a philosopher may describe is ultimately K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, or Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u (<span class="Italic">sarva&#7745; khalv ida&#7745; brahma, para&#7745; brahma para&#7745; dh&#257;ma pavitra&#7745; parama&#7745; bhav&#257;n</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="index1ba6.html?g=3396">10.12</a></I>]</I>). According to different phases of understanding, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is differently described, but in fact He is the origin of everything.</div>
<div class="Purport">Because Devak&#299; was an unalloyed devotee, she could understand that the same Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u had appeared as her son. Therefore, after the prayers of Vasudeva, Devak&#299; offered her prayers. She was very frightened because of her brother&rsquo;s atrocities. Devak&#299; said, &ldquo;My dear Lord, Your eternal forms, like N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, Lord R&#257;ma, &#346;e&#7779;a, Var&#257;ha, N&#7771;si&#7745;ha, V&#257;mana, Baladeva, and millions of similar incarnations emanating from Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, are described in the Vedic literature as original. You are original because all Your forms as incarnations are outside of this material creation. Your form was existing before this cosmic manifestation was created. Your forms are eternal and all-pervading. They are self-effulgent, changeless and uncontaminated by the material qualities. Such eternal forms are ever-cognizant and full of bliss; they are situated in transcendental goodness and are always engaged in different pastimes. You are not limited to a particular form only; all such transcendental, eternal forms are self-sufficient. I can understand that You are the Supreme Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u.&rdquo; We may conclude, therefore, that Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is everything, although He is also different from everything. This is the <span class="Italic"> philosophy.</div>

<div class="Translation">No one in this material world has become free from the four principles birth, death, old age and disease, even by fleeing to various planets. But now that You have appeared, My Lord, death is fleeing in fear of You, and the living entities, having obtained shelter at Your lotus feet by Your mercy, are sleeping in full mental peace.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">There are different categories of living entities, but everyone is afraid of death. The highest aim of the <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> is to be promoted to the higher, heavenly planets, where the duration of life is very long. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index4a77.html?g=2886">8.17</a>), <span class="Italic">sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahma&#7751;o vidu&#7717;:</span> one day of Brahm&#257; equals 1,000 <span class="Italic">yugas,</span> and each <span class="Italic">yuga</span> consists of 4,300,000 years. Similarly, Brahm&#257; has a night of 1,000 times 4,300,000 years. In this way, we may calculate Brahm&#257;&rsquo;s month and year, but even Brahm&#257;, who lives for millions and millions of years (<span class="Italic">dvi-par&#257;rdha-k&#257;la</span>), also must die. According to Vedic <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra,</span> the inhabitants of the higher planetary systems live for 10,000 years, and just as Brahm&#257;&rsquo;s day is calculated to equal 4,300,000,000 of our years, one day in the higher planetary systems equals six of our months. <span class="Italic">Karm&#299;s,</span> therefore, try for promotion to the higher planetary systems, but this cannot free them from death. In this material world, everyone from Brahm&#257; to the insignificant ant must die. Therefore this world is called <span class="Italic">martya-loka.</span> As K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexa520.html?g=2877">8.16</a>), <span class="Italic">&#257;brahma-bhuvan&#257;l lok&#257;&#7717; punar &#257;vartino&rsquo;rjuna:</span> as long as one is within this material world, either on Brahmaloka or on any other <span class="Italic">loka</span> within this universe, one must undergo the <span class="Italic">k&#257;la-cakra</span> of one life after another (<span class="Italic">bh&#363;tv&#257; bh&#363;tv&#257; pral&#299;yate</span>). But if one returns to the Supreme Personality of Godhead (<span class="Italic">yad gatv&#257; na nivartante </I>[Bg. </I><a href="index34f4.html?g=4877">15.6</a></I>]</I></span>), one need not reenter the limits of time. Therefore, devotees who have taken shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord can sleep very peacefully with this assurance from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexe89d.html?g=1505">4.9</a>), <span class="Italic">tyaktv&#257; deha&#7745; punar janma naiti:</span> after giving up the present body, a devotee who has understood K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as He is need not return to this material world.</div>
<div class="Purport">The constitutional position for the living entity is eternity (<span class="Italic">na hanyate hanyam&#257;ne &#347;ar&#299;re, nitya&#7717; &#347;&#257;&#347;vato &rsquo;yam</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="indexd7ba.html?g=565">2.20</a></I>]</I>). Every living entity is eternal. But because of having fallen into this material world, one wanders within the universe, continually changing from one body to another. Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">brahm&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a bhramite kona bh&#257;gyav&#257;n j&#299;va<br>guru-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-pras&#257;de p&#257;ya bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja</div>

<div class="VerseRef">(Cc. <span class="Ref_Italic">Madhya</span> <a href="index9884.html?g=124149">19.151</a>)</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Everyone is wandering up and down within this universe, but one who is sufficiently fortunate comes in contact with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, by the mercy of the spiritual master, and takes to the path of devotional service. Then one is assured of eternal life, with no fear of death. When K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appears, everyone is freed from fear of death, yet Devak&#299; felt, &ldquo;We are still afraid of Ka&#7745;sa, although You have appeared as our son.&rdquo; She was more or less bewildered as to why this should be so, and she appealed to the Lord to free her and Vasudeva from this fear.</div>
<div class="Purport">In this connection, it may be noted that the moon is one of the heavenly planets. From the Vedic literature we understand that one who goes to the moon receives a life with a duration of ten thousand years in which to enjoy the fruits of pious activities. If our so-called scientists are going to the moon, why should they come back here? We must conclude without a doubt that they have never gone to the moon. To go to the moon, one must have the qualification of pious activities. Then one may go there and live. If one has gone to the moon, why should he return to this planet, where life is of a very short duration?</div>

<div class="Translation">My Lord, because You dispel all the fear of Your devotees, I request You to save us and give us protection from the terrible fear of Ka&#7745;sa. Your form as Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is appreciated by yog&#299;s in meditation. Please make this form invisible to those who see with material eyes.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The word <span class="Italic">dhy&#257;na-dhi&#7779;&#7751;yam</span> is significant in this verse because the form of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is meditated upon by <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> (<span class="Italic">dhy&#257;n&#257;vasthita-tad-gatena manas&#257; pa&#347;yanti ya&#7745; yogina&#7717;</I> [SB </span></I>12.13.1]). Devak&#299; requested the Lord, who had appeared as Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, to conceal that form, for she wanted to see the Lord as an ordinary child, like a child appreciated by persons who have material eyes. Devak&#299; wanted to see whether the Supreme Personality of Godhead had factually appeared or she was dreaming the Vi&#7779;&#7751;u form. If Ka&#7745;sa were to come, she thought, upon seeing the Vi&#7779;&#7751;u form he would immediately kill the child, but if he saw a human child, he might reconsider. Devak&#299; was afraid of Ugrasena-&#257;tmaja; that is, she was afraid not of Ugrasena and his men, but of the son of Ugrasena. Thus she requested the Lord to dissipate that fear, since He is always ready to give protection (<span class="Italic">abhayam</span>) to His devotees. &ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; she prayed, &ldquo;I request You to save me from the cruel hands of the son of Ugrasena, Ka&#7745;sa. I am praying to Your Lordship to please rescue me from this fearful condition because You are always ready to give protection to Your servitors.&rdquo; The Lord has confirmed this statement in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> by assuring Arjuna, &ldquo;You may declare to the world, My devotee shall never be vanquished.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">While thus praying to the Lord for rescue, mother Devak&#299; expressed her motherly affection: &ldquo;I understand that this transcendental form is generally perceived in meditation by the great sages, but I am still afraid because as soon as Ka&#7745;sa understands that You have appeared, he might harm You. So I request that for the time being You become invisible to our material eyes.&rdquo; In other words, she requested the Lord to assume the form of an ordinary child. &ldquo;My only cause of fear from my brother Ka&#7745;sa is due to Your appearance. My Lord Madhus&#363;dana, Ka&#7745;sa may know that You are already born. Therefore I request You to conceal this four-armed form of Your Lordship, which holds the four symbols of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&mdash;namely the conchshell, the disc, the club and the lotus flower. My dear Lord, at the end of the annihilation of the cosmic manifestation, You put the whole universe within Your abdomen; still, by Your unalloyed mercy, You have appeared in my womb. I am surprised that You imitate the activities of ordinary human beings just to please Your devotee.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">Devak&#299; was so afraid of Ka&#7745;sa that she could not believe that Ka&#7745;sa would be unable to kill Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, who was personally present. Out of motherly affection, therefore, she requested the Supreme Personality of Godhead to disappear. Although because of the Lord&rsquo;s disappearance Ka&#7745;sa would harass her more and more, thinking that the child born of her was hidden somewhere, she did not want the transcendental child to be harassed and killed. Therefore she requested Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u to disappear. Later, when harassed, she would think of Him within her mind.</div>

<div class="First">As explained in <span class="Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta,</span> loving service to the Personality of Godhead is of two different kinds: <span class="Italic">ai&#347;varya-p&#363;r&#7751;a,</span> full of opulence, and <span class="Italic">ai&#347;varya-&#347;&#299;thila,</span> without opulence. Real love of Godhead begins with <span class="Italic">ai&#347;varya-&#347;&#299;thila,</span> simply on the basis of pure love.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">Pure devotees, whose eyes are anointed with the ointment of <span class="Italic">prema,</span> love, want to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead as &#346;y&#257;masundara, Mural&#299;dhara, with a flute swaying in His two hands. This is the form available to the inhabitants of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, who are all in love with the Supreme Personality of Godhead as &#346;y&#257;masundara, not as Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, who is worshiped in Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha, where the devotees admire His opulence. Although Devak&#299; is not on the V&#7771;nd&#257;vana platform, she is near the V&#7771;nd&#257;vana platform. On the V&#7771;nd&#257;vana platform the mother of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, and on the Mathur&#257; and Dv&#257;rak&#257; platform the mother of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is Devak&#299;. In Mathur&#257; and Dv&#257;rak&#257; the love for the Lord is mixed with appreciation of His opulence, but in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana the opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not exhibited.</div>
<div class="Purport">There are five stages of loving service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead&mdash;<span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;nta, d&#257;sya, sakhya, v&#257;tsalya</span> and <span class="Italic">m&#257;dhurya.</span> Devak&#299; is on the platform of <span class="Italic">v&#257;tsalya.</span> She wanted to deal with her eternal son, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, in that stage of love, and therefore she wanted the Supreme Personality of Godhead to withdraw His opulent form of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura illuminates this fact very clearly in his explanation of this verse.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Bhakti, bhagav&#257;n</span> and <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> do not belong to the material world. This is confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexee26.html?g=4817">14.26</a>):</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;One who engages in the spiritual activities of unalloyed devotional service immediately transcends the modes of material nature and is elevated to the spiritual platform.&rdquo; From the very beginning of one&rsquo;s transactions in <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> one is situated on the transcendental platform. Vasudeva and Devak&#299;, therefore, being situated in a completely pure devotional state, are beyond this material world and are not subject to material fear. In the transcendental world, however, because of pure devotion, there is a similar conception of fear, which is due to intense love.</div>
<div class="Purport">As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">bhakty&#257; m&#257;m abhij&#257;n&#257;ti y&#257;v&#257;n ya&#347; c&#257;smi tattvata&#7717;</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexbf7d.html?g=5898">18.55</a>]) and as confirmed in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<span class="Italic">bhakty&#257;ham ekay&#257; gr&#257;hya&#7717;</span>), without <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> one cannot understand the spiritual situation of the Lord. <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> may be considered in three stages, called <span class="Italic">gu&#7751;&#299;-bh&#363;ta, pradh&#257;n&#299;-bh&#363;ta</span> and <span class="Italic">kevala,</span> and according to these stages there are three divisions, which are called <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na, j&ntilde;&#257;namay&#299;</span> and <span class="Italic">rati,</span> or <span class="Italic">prem&#257;</span>&mdash;that is, simple knowledge, love mixed with knowledge, and pure love. By simple knowledge, one can perceive transcendental bliss without variety. This perception is called <span class="Italic">m&#257;na-bh&#363;ti.</span> When one comes to the stage of <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;namay&#299;,</span> one realizes the transcendental opulences of the Personality of Godhead. But when one reaches pure love, one realizes the transcendental form of the Lord as Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a or Lord R&#257;ma. This is what is wanted. Especially in the <span class="Italic">m&#257;dhurya-rasa,</span> one becomes attached to the Personality of Godhead (<span class="Italic">&#347;r&#299;-vigraha-ni&#7779;&#7789;ha-r&#363;p&#257;di</span>). Then loving transactions between the Lord and the devotee begin.</div>
<div class="Purport">The special significance of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s bearing a flute in His hands in Vrajabh&#363;mi, V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, is described as <span class="Italic">m&#257;dhur&#299;.</span> <span class="Italic">.. vir&#257;jate.</span> The form of the Lord with a flute in His hands is most attractive, and the one who is most sublimely attracted is &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;&#7751;&#299;, R&#257;dhik&#257;. She enjoys supremely blissful association with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Sometimes people cannot understand why R&#257;dhik&#257;&rsquo;s name is not mentioned in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> Actually, however, R&#257;dhik&#257; can be understood from the word <span class="Italic">&#257;r&#257;dhana,</span> which indicates that She enjoys the highest loving affairs with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>
<div class="Purport">Not wanting to be ridiculed for having given birth to Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, Devak&#299; wanted K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, with two hands, and therefore she requested the Lord to change His form.</div>

<div class="Translation">When both of you were ordered by Lord Brahm&#257; to create progeny, you first underwent severe austerities by controlling your senses.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Here is an instruction about how to use one&rsquo;s senses to create progeny. According to Vedic principles, before creating progeny one must fully control the senses. This control takes place through the <span class="Italic">garbh&#257;dh&#257;na-sa&#7745;sk&#257;ra.</span> In India there is great agitation for birth control in various mechanical ways, but birth cannot be mechanically controlled. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index8818-2.html?g=4371">13.9</a>), <span class="Italic">janma-m&#7771;tyu jar&#257;-vy&#257;dhi-du&#7717;kha-do&#7779;&#257;nudar&#347;anam:</span> birth, death, old age and disease are certainly the primary distresses of the material world. People are trying to control birth, but they are not able to control death; and if one cannot control death, one cannot control birth either. In other words, artificially controlling birth is not any more feasible than artificially controlling death.</div>
<div class="Purport">According to Vedic civilization, procreation should not be contrary to religious principles, and then the birthrate will be controlled. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexbe66.html?g=2559">7.11</a>), <span class="Italic">dharm&#257;viruddho bh&#363;te&#7779;u k&#257;mo&rsquo;smi:</span> sex not contrary to religious principles is a representation of the Supreme Lord. People should be educated in how to give birth to good children through <span class="Italic">sa&#7745;sk&#257;ras,</span> beginning with the <span class="Italic">garbh&#257;dh&#257;na-sa&#7745;sk&#257;ra;</span> birth should not be controlled by artificial means, for this will lead to a civilization of animals. If one follows religious principles, he automatically practices birth control because if one is spiritually educated he knows that the after-effects of sex are various types of misery (<span class="Italic">bahu-du&#7717;kha-bh&#257;ja</span>). One who is spiritually advanced does not indulge in uncontrolled sex. Therefore, instead of being forced to refrain from sex or refrain from giving birth to many children, people should be spiritually educated, and then birth control will automatically follow.</div>
<div class="Purport">If one is determined to make spiritual advancement, he will not beget a child unless able to make that child a devotee. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="index65b1.html?g=42877">5.5.18</a>), <span class="Italic">pit&#257; na sa sy&#257;t:</span> one should not become a father unless one is able to protect his child from <span class="Italic">m&#7771;tyu,</span> the path of birth and death. But where is there education about this? A responsible father never begets children like cats and dogs. Instead of being encouraged to adopt artificial means of birth control, people should be educated in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness because only then will they understand their responsibility to their children. If one can beget children who will be devotees and be taught to turn aside from the path of birth and death (<span class="Italic">m&#7771;tyu-sa&#7745;s&#257;ra-vartmani</span>), there is no need of birth control. Rather, one should be encouraged to beget children. Artificial means of birth control have no value. Whether one begets children or does not, a population of men who are like cats and dogs will never make human society happy. It is therefore necessary for people to be educated spiritually so that instead of begetting children like cats and dogs, they will undergo austerities to produce devotees. This will make their lives successful.</div>

<div class="First">Vasudeva and Devak&#299; did not obtain the Supreme Personality of Godhead as their son very easily, nor does the Supreme Godhead accept merely anyone as His father and mother. Here we can see how Vasudeva and Devak&#299; obtained K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as their eternal son. In our own lives, we are meant to follow the principles indicated herewith for getting good children. Of course, it is not possible for everyone to get K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as his son, but at least one can get very good sons and daughters for the benefit of human society. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is said that if human beings do not follow the spiritual way of life, there will be an increase of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;a-sa&#7749;kara</span> population, population begotten like cats and dogs, and the entire world will become like hell. Not practicing K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness but simply encouraging artificial means to check the population will be futile; the population will increase, and it will consist of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;a-sa&#7749;kara,</span> unwanted progeny. It is better to teach people how to beget children not like hogs and dogs, but in controlled life.</div>
<div class="Purport">Human life is meant not for becoming a hog or dog, but for <span class="Italic">tapo divyam,</span> transcendental austerity. Everyone should be taught to undergo austerity, <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> Although it may not be possible to undergo <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> like that of P&#7771;&#347;ni and Sutap&#257;, the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra</span> has given an opportunity for a method of <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> very easy to perform&mdash;the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> movement. One cannot expect to undergo <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> to get K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as one&rsquo;s child, yet simply by chanting the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra</span> (<span class="Italic">k&#299;rtan&#257;d eva k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;asya</span>), one can become so pure that one becomes free from all the contamination of this material world (<span class="Italic">mukta-sa&#7749;ga&#7717;</span>) and goes back home, back to Godhead (<span class="Italic">para&#7745; vrajet</span>). The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, therefore, is teaching people not to adopt artificial means of happiness, but to take the real path of happiness as prescribed in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra</span>&mdash;the chanting of the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra</span>&mdash;and become perfect in every aspect of material existence.</div>

<div class="Translation">O sinless mother Devak&#299;, after the expiry of twelve thousand celestial years, in which you constantly contemplated Me within the core of your heart with great faith, devotion and austerity, I was very much satisfied with you. Since I am the best of all bestowers of benediction, I appeared in this same form as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a to ask you to take from Me the benediction you desired. You then expressed your desire to have a son exactly like Me.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Twelve thousand years on the celestial planets is not a very long time for those who live in the upper planetary system, although it may be very long for those who live on this planet. Sutap&#257; was the son of Brahm&#257;, and as we have already understood from <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index4a77.html?g=2886">8.17</a>), one day of Brahm&#257; equals many millions of years according to our calculation (<span class="Italic">sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahma&#7751;o vidu&#7717;</span>). We should be careful to understand that to get K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as one&rsquo;s son, one must undergo such great austerities. If we want to get the Supreme Personality of Godhead to become one of us in this material world, this requires great penance, but if we want to go back to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (<span class="Italic">tyaktv&#257; deha&#7745; punar janma naiti m&#257;m eti so &rsquo;rjuna</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexe89d.html?g=1505">4.9</a>]), we need only understand Him and love Him. Through love only, we can very easily go back home, back to Godhead. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu therefore declared, <span class="Italic">prem&#257; pum-artho mah&#257;n:</span> love of Godhead is the highest achievement for anyone.</div>
<div class="Purport">As we have explained, in worship of the Lord there are three stages&mdash;<span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na, j&ntilde;&#257;namay&#299;</span> and <span class="Italic">rati,</span> or love. Sutap&#257; and his wife, P&#7771;&#347;ni, inaugurated their devotional activities on the basis of full knowledge. Gradually they developed love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and when this love was mature, the Lord appeared as Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, although Devak&#299; then requested Him to assume the form of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. To love the Supreme Personality of Godhead more, we want a form of the Lord like K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a or R&#257;ma. We can engage in loving transactions with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a especially.</div>
<div class="Purport">In this age, we are all fallen, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead has appeared as Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu to bestow upon us love of Godhead directly. This was appreciated by the associates of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; said:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">namo mah&#257;-vad&#257;ny&#257;ya<br>k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-prema-prad&#257;ya te<br>k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;&#257;ya k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-caitanya-<br>n&#257;mne gaura-tvi&#7779;e nama&#7717;<br></I> [Madhya </I><a href="index45fd.html?g=123492">19.53</a></I>]</I></div>

<div class="After-Verse">In this verse, &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu is described as <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-vad&#257;nya,</span> the most munificent of charitable persons, because He gives K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a so easily that one can attain K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a simply by chanting the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra.</span> We should therefore take advantage of the benediction given by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, and when by chanting the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra</span> we are cleansed of all dirty things (<span class="Italic">ceto-darpa&#7751;a-m&#257;rjanam</I> [Cc. Antya </I><a href="index0860.html?g=154712">20.12</a></I>]</span></I>), we shall be able to understand very easily that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the only object of love (<span class="Italic">k&#299;rtan&#257;d eva k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;asya mukta-sa&#7749;ga&#7717; para&#7745; vrajet</span>).</div>
<div class="Purport">Therefore, one need not undergo severe penances for many thousands of years; one need only learn how to love K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and be always engaged in His service (<span class="Italic">sevonmukhe hi jihv&#257;dau svayam eva sphuraty ada&#7717;</span>). Then one can very easily go back home, back to Godhead. Instead of bringing the Lord here for some material purpose, to have a son or whatever else, if we go back home, back to Godhead, our real relationship with the Lord is revealed, and we eternally engage in our eternal relationship. By chanting the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> we gradually develop our eternal relationship with the Supreme Person and thus attain the perfection called <span class="Italic">.</span> We should take advantage of this benediction and go back home, back to Godhead. &#346;r&#299;la Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura has therefore sung, <span class="Italic">patita-p&#257;vana-hetu tava avat&#257;ra:</span> Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu appeared as an incarnation to deliver all fallen souls like us and directly bestow upon us love of Godhead. We must take advantage of this great benediction of the great personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="First">Vasudeva and Devak&#299; had been <span class="Italic">dam-pat&#299;,</span> husband and wife, since the time of Sutap&#257; and P&#7771;&#347;ni, and they wanted to remain husband and wife in order to have the Supreme Personality of Godhead as their son. This attachment came about by the influence of <span class="Italic">devam&#257;y&#257;.</span> Loving K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as one&rsquo;s son is a Vedic principle. Vasudeva and Devak&#299; never desired anything but to have the Lord as their son, yet for this purpose they apparently wanted to live like ordinary <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hasthas</span> for sexual indulgence. Although this was a transaction of spiritual potency, their desire appears like attachment for sex in conjugal life. If one wants to return home, back to Godhead, one must give up such desires. This is possible only when one develops intense love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu has said:</div>

This is the explanation given in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-sandarbha</span> by &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;.</div>

<div class="Translation">I have shown you this form of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u just to remind you of My previous births. Otherwise, if I appeared like an ordinary human child, you would not believe that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, has indeed appeared.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Devak&#299; did not need to be reminded that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, had appeared as her son; she already accepted this. Nonetheless, she was anxious, thinking that if her neighbors heard that Vi&#7779;&#7751;u had appeared as her son, none of them would believe it. Therefore she wanted Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u to transform Himself into a human child. On the other hand, the Supreme Lord was also anxious, thinking that if He appeared as an ordinary child, she would not believe that Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u had appeared. Such are the dealings between devotees and the Lord. The Lord deals with His devotees exactly like a human being, but this does not mean that the Lord is one of the human beings, for this is the conclusion of nondevotees (<span class="Italic">avaj&#257;nanti m&#257;&#7745; m&#363;&#7693;h&#257; m&#257;nu&#7779;&#299;&#7745; tanum &#257;&#347;ritam</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexa12b.html?g=3084">9.11</a>]). Devotees know the Supreme Personality of Godhead under any circumstances. This is the difference between a devotee and a nondevotee. The Lord says, <span class="Italic">man-man&#257; bhava mad-bhakto mad-y&#257;j&#299; m&#257;&#7745; namaskuru:</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index673b.html?g=5988">18.65</a>] &ldquo;Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, become My devotee, offer obeisances and worship Me.&rdquo; A nondevotee cannot believe that simply by thinking of one person, one can achieve liberation from this material world and go back home, back to Godhead. But this is a fact. The Lord comes as a human being, and if one becomes attached to the Lord on the platform of loving service, one&rsquo;s promotion to the transcendental world is assured.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This instruction by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to His father and mother, who are eternally connected with Him, is especially intended for persons eager to return home, back to Godhead. One should never think of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as an ordinary human being, as nondevotees do. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, personally appeared and left His instructions for the benefit of all human society, but fools and rascals unfortunately think of Him as an ordinary human being and twist the instructions of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> for the satisfaction of their senses. Practically everyone commenting on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> interprets it for sense gratification. It has become especially fashionable for modern scholars and politicians to interpret <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as if it were something fictitious, and by their wrong interpretations they are spoiling their own careers and the careers of others. The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, however, is fighting against this principle of regarding K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as a fictitious person and of accepting that there was no Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra, that everything is symbolic, and that nothing in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> is true. In any case, if one truly wants to be successful, one can do so by reading the text of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as it is. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu especially stressed the instructions of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;:</span> <span class="Italic">y&#257;re dekha, t&#257;re kaha &lsquo;k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;-upade&#347;a</I> [</span></I>Cc. <span class="Ref_Italic"></B></I>Madhya</span></B></I> <a href="index89c7.html?g=104673">7.128</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> If one wants to achieve the highest success in life, one must accept <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as spoken by the Supreme Lord. By accepting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> in this way, all of human society can become perfect and happy.</div>
<div class="Purport">It is to be noted that because Vasudeva and Devak&#299; would be separated from K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a when He was carried to Gokula, the residence of Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, the Lord personally instructed them that they should always think of Him as their son and as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That would keep them in touch with Him. After eleven years, the Lord would return to Mathur&#257; to be their son, and therefore there was no question of separation.</div>

<div class="First">As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index333e.html?g=1478">4.6</a>), <span class="Italic">sambhav&#257;my &#257;tma-m&#257;yay&#257;:</span> whatever is done by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is done by His spiritual energy; nothing is forced upon Him by the material energy.

<div class="VerseRef">(<span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;vet&#257;&#347;vatara Upani&#7779;ad</span> 6.8)</div>
<div class="After-Verse">It is natural for the Lord to be untinged by material qualities, and because everything is perfectly present in His spiritual energy, as soon as He desires something, it is immediately done. The Lord is not a <span class="Italic">pr&#257;k&#7771;ta-&#347;i&#347;u,</span> a child of this world, but by His personal energy He appeared like one. Ordinary people may have difficulty accepting the supreme controller, God, as a human being because they forget that He can do everything by spiritual energy (<span class="Italic">&#257;tma-m&#257;yay&#257;</span>). Nonbelievers say, &ldquo;How can the supreme controller descend as an ordinary being?&rdquo; This sort of thinking is materialistic. &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; says that unless we accept the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as inconceivable, beyond the conception of our words and mind, we cannot understand the Supreme Lord. Those who doubt that the Supreme Personality of Godhead can come as a human being and turn Himself into a human child are fools who think that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s body is material, that He is born and that He therefore also dies.</div>
<div class="Purport">In <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> Third Canto, Fourth Chapter, verses 28 and 29, there is a description of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s leaving His body. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it inquired from &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, &ldquo;When all the members of the Yadu dynasty met their end, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a also put an end to Himself, and the only member of the family who remained alive was Uddhava. How was this possible?&rdquo; &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; answered that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, by His own energy, destroyed the entire family and then thought of making His own body disappear. In this connection, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; described how the Lord gave up His body. But this was not the destruction of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s body; rather, it was the disappearance of the Supreme Lord by His personal energy.</div>
<div class="Purport">Actually, the Lord does not give up His body, which is eternal, but as He can change His body from the form of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u to that of an ordinary human child, He can change His body to any form He likes. This does not mean that He gives up His body. By spiritual energy, the Lord can appear in a body made of wood or stone. He can change His body into anything because everything is His energy (<span class="Italic">par&#257;sya &#347;aktir vividhaiva &#347;r&#363;yate</span>). As clearly said in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index7379.html?g=2496">7.4</a>), <span class="Italic">bhinn&#257; prak&#7771;tir a&#7779;&#7789;adh&#257;:</span> the material elements are separated energies of the Supreme Lord. If He transforms Himself into the <span class="Italic">arc&#257;-m&#363;rti,</span> the worshipable Deity, which we see as stone or wood, He is still K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Therefore the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra</span> warns, <span class="Italic">arcye vi&#7779;&#7751;au &#347;il&#257;-dh&#299;r guru&#7779;u nara-mati&#7717;.</span> One who thinks that the worshipable Deity in the temple is made of wood or stone, one who sees a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava <span class="Italic">guru</span> as an ordinary human being, or one who materially conceives of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava as belonging to a particular caste is <span class="Italic">n&#257;rak&#299;,</span> a resident of hell. The Supreme Personality of Godhead can appear before us in many forms, as he likes, but we must know the true facts: <span class="Italic">janma karma ca me divyam eva&#7745; yo vetti tattvata&#7717;</span> (Bg. <a href="indexe89d.html?g=1505">4.9</a>). By following the instructions of <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhu, guru</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra</span>&mdash;the saintly persons, the spiritual master and the authoritative scriptures&mdash;one can understand K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and then one makes his life successful by returning home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="First">Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and Vasudeva were intimate friends, and so were their wives, Ya&#347;od&#257; and Devak&#299;. Although their names were different, they were practically nondifferent personalities. The only difference is that Devak&#299; was able to understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead had been born to her and had now changed into K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, whereas Ya&#347;od&#257; was not able to understand what kind of child had been born to her. Ya&#347;od&#257; was such an advanced devotee that she never regarded K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but simply loved Him as her own child. Devak&#299;, however, knew from the very beginning that although K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was her son, He was the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, no one regarded K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Sometimes they suggested that some great demigod had appeared there as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. In such an exalted status of devotional service, a devotee forgets the position of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and intensely loves the Supreme Personality of Godhead without understanding His position.

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This chapter describes how Ka&#7745;sa, following the advice of his demoniac friends, considered the persecution of small children to be very diplomatic.</div>
</div><A NAME="123049"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">After Vasudeva bound himself with iron shackles as before, all the doors of the prison house closed by the influence of Yogam&#257;y&#257;, who then began crying as a newborn child, This crying awakened the doorkeepers, who immediately informed Ka&#7745;sa that a child had been born to Devak&#299;. Upon hearing this news, Ka&#7745;sa appeared with great force in the maternity room, and in spite of Devak&#299;&rsquo;s pleas that the child be saved, the demon forcibly snatched the child from Devak&#299;&rsquo;s hands and dashed the child against a rock. Unfortunately for Ka&#7745;sa, however, the newborn child slipped away from his hands, rose above his head and appeared as the eight-armed form of Durg&#257;. Durg&#257; then told Ka&#7745;sa, &ldquo;The enemy you contemplate has taken birth somewhere else. Therefore your plan to persecute all the children will prove futile.&rdquo;</div>
</div><A NAME="123050"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">According to the prophecy, the eighth child of Devak&#299; would kill Ka&#7745;sa, and therefore when Ka&#7745;sa saw that the eighth child was a female and heard that his so-called enemy had taken birth elsewhere, he was struck with wonder. He decided to release Devak&#299; and Vasudeva, and he admitted before them the wrongness of his atrocities. Falling at the feet of Devak&#299; and Vasudeva, he begged their pardon and tried to convince them that because the events that had taken place were destined to happen, they should not be unhappy for his having killed so many of their children. Devak&#299; and Vasudeva, being naturally very pious, immediately excused Ka&#7745;sa for his atrocities, and Ka&#7745;sa, after seeing that his sister and brother-in-law were happy, returned to his home.</div>
</div><A NAME="123051"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">After the night passed, however, Ka&#7745;sa called for his ministers and informed them of all that had happened. The ministers, who were all demons, advised Ka&#7745;sa that because his enemy had already taken birth somewhere else, all the children born within the past ten days in the villages within Ka&#7745;sa&rsquo;s kingdom should be killed. Although the demigods always feared Ka&#7745;sa, they should not be treated leniently; since they were enemies, Ka&#7745;sa should try his best to uproot their existence. The demoniac ministers further advised that Ka&#7745;sa and the demons continue their enmity toward Vi&#7779;&#7751;u because Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is the original person among all the demigods. The <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> the cows, the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> austerity, truthfulness, control of the senses and mind, faithfulness and mercy are among the different parts of the body of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, who is the origin of all the demigods, including Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord &#346;iva. Therefore, the ministers advised, the demigods, the saintly persons, the cows and the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> should be systematically persecuted. Strongly advised in this way by his friends, the demoniac ministers, Ka&#7745;sa approved of their instructions and considered it beneficial to be envious of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> Following Ka&#7745;sa&rsquo;s orders, therefore, the demons began committing their atrocities all over Vrajabh&#363;mi.</div>

<div class="First">The activities of Yogam&#257;y&#257; are distinctly visible in this chapter, in which Devak&#299; and Vasudeva excuse Ka&#7745;sa for his many devious, atrocious activities and Ka&#7745;sa becomes repentant and falls at their feet. Before the awakening of the watchmen and the others in the prison house, many other things happened.

If one dog barks, many other dogs immediately follow it by barking. Although the street dogs are not appointed by anyone to act as watchmen, they think they are responsible for protecting the neighborhood, and as soon as someone unknown enters it, they all begin to bark. Both Yogam&#257;y&#257; and Mah&#257;m&#257;y&#257; act in all material activities (<span class="Italic">prak&#7771;te&#7717; kriyam&#257;&#7751;&#257;ni gu&#7751;ai&#7717; karm&#257;&#7751;i sarva&#347;a&#7717;</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index15ec.html?g=1275">3.27</a>]), but although the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead acts under the Supreme Lord&rsquo;s direction (<span class="Italic">may&#257;dhyak&#7779;e&#7751;a prak&#7771;ti&#7717; s&#363;yate sa-car&#257;caram</I> [Bg. </I><a href="index652d.html?g=3075">9.10</a></I>]</I></span>), doglike watchmen such as politicians and diplomats think that they are protecting their neighborhoods from the dangers of the outside world.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The word <span class="Italic">k&#257;la&#7717;</span> is significant. Although the child was born to kill Ka&#7745;sa, Ka&#7745;sa thought that this was the proper time to kill the child so that he himself would be saved. <span class="Italic">K&#257;la</span> is actually another name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead when He appears only for the purpose of killing. When Arjuna inquired from K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in His universal form, &ldquo;Who are You?&rdquo; the Lord presented Himself as <span class="Italic">k&#257;la,</span> death personified to kill. By nature&rsquo;s law, when there is an unwanted increase in population, <span class="Italic">k&#257;la</span> appears, and by some arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, people are killed wholesale in different ways, by war, pestilence, famine and so on. At that time, even atheistic political leaders go to a church, mosque or temple for protection by God or gods and submissively say, &ldquo;God willing.&rdquo; Before that, they pay no attention to God, not caring to know God or His will, but when <span class="Italic">k&#257;la</span> appears, they say, &ldquo;God willing.&rdquo; Death is but another feature of the supreme <span class="Italic">k&#257;la,</span> the Supreme Personality of Godhead. At the time of death, the atheist must submit to this supreme <span class="Italic">k&#257;la,</span> and then the Supreme Personality of Godhead takes away all his possessions (<span class="Italic">m&#7771;tyu&#7717; sarva-hara&#347; c&#257;ham</span>) and forces him to accept another body (<span class="Italic">tath&#257; deh&#257;ntara-pr&#257;pti&#7717;</span>). This the atheists do not know, and if they do know, they neglect it so that they may go on with their normal life. The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is trying to teach them that although for a few years one may act as a great protector or great watchman, with the appearance of <span class="Italic">k&#257;la,</span> death, one must take another body by the laws of nature. Not knowing this, they unnecessarily waste their time in their occupation as watchdogs and do not try to get the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As it is clearly said, <span class="Italic">apr&#257;pya m&#257;&#7745; nivartante m&#7771;tyu-sa&#7745;s&#257;ra-vartmani:</span> without K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, one is condemned to continue wandering in birth and death, not knowing what will happen in one&rsquo;s next birth.</div>

Devak&#299; wanted to save her brother from this terrible, sinful act. Therefore she told him, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so atrocious as to kill a female child. Let there be all good fortune for you.&rdquo; Demons can do anything for their personal benefit, not considering what is pious or vicious. But Devak&#299;, on the contrary, although safe because she had already given birth to her own son, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, was anxious to save the daughter of someone else.

<div class="Translation">My dear brother, by the influence of destiny you have already killed many babies, each of them as bright and beautiful as fire. But kindly spare this daughter. Give her to me as your gift.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Here we see that Devak&#299; first focused Ka&#7745;sa&rsquo;s attention on his atrocious activities, his killing of her many sons. Then she wanted to compromise with him by saying that whatever he had done was not his fault, but was ordained by destiny. Then she appealed to him to give her the daughter as a gift. Devak&#299; was the daughter of a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> and knew how to play the political game. In politics there are different methods of achieving success: first repression (<span class="Italic">dama</span>), then compromise (<span class="Italic">s&#257;ma</span>), and then asking for a gift (<span class="Italic">d&#257;na</span>). Devak&#299; first adopted the policy of repression by directly attacking Ka&#7745;sa for having cruelly, atrociously killed her babies. Then she compromised by saying that this was not his fault, and then she begged for a gift. As we learn from the history of the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata,</span> or &ldquo;Greater India,&rdquo; the wives and daughters of the ruling class, the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas,</span> knew the political game, but we never find that a woman was given the post of chief executive. This is in accordance with the injunctions of <span class="Italic">Manu-sa&#7745;hit&#257;,</span> but unfortunately <span class="Italic">Manu-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> is now being insulted, and the &#256;ryans, the members of Vedic society, cannot do anything. Such is the nature of Kali-yuga.</div>
<div class="Purport">Nothing happens unless ordained by destiny.</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">tasyaiva heto&#7717; prayateta kovido<br>na labhyate yad bhramat&#257;m upary adha&#7717;<br>tal labhyate du&#7717;khavad anyata&#7717; sukha&#7745;<br>k&#257;lena sarvatra gabh&#299;ra-ra&#7745;has&#257;</div>

<div class="VerseRef">(<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="index968b.html?g=7485">1.5.18</a>)</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Devak&#299; knew very well that because the killing of her many children had been ordained by destiny, Ka&#7745;sa was not to be blamed. There was no need to give good instructions to Ka&#7745;sa. <span class="Italic">Upade&#347;o hi murkh&#257;&#7751;&#257;&#7745; prakop&#257;ya na &#347;&#257;ntaye</span> (C&#257;&#7751;akya Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita). If a foolish person is given good instructions, he becomes more and more angry. Moreover, a cruel person is more dangerous than a snake. A snake and a cruel person are both cruel, but a cruel person is more dangerous because although a snake can be charmed by <span class="Italic">mantras</span> or subdued by herbs, a cruel person cannot be subdued by any means. Such was the nature of Ka&#7745;sa.</div>

<div class="Translation">After hearing the words of the goddess Durg&#257;, Ka&#7745;sa was struck with wonder. Thus he approached his sister Devak&#299; and brother-in-law Vasudeva, released them immediately from their shackles, and very humbly spoke as follows.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Ka&#7745;sa was astonished because the goddess Durg&#257; had become the daughter of Devak&#299;. Since Devak&#299; was a human being, how could the goddess Durg&#257; become her daughter? This was one cause of his astonishment. Also, how is it that the eighth child of Devak&#299; was a female? This also astonished him. <span class="Italic">Asuras</span> are generally devotees of mother Durg&#257;, &#346;akti, or of demigods, especially Lord &#346;iva. The appearance of Durg&#257; in her original eight-armed feature, holding various weapons, immediately changed Ka&#7745;sa&rsquo;s mind about Devak&#299;&rsquo;s being an ordinary human. Devak&#299; must have had some transcendental qualities; otherwise why would the goddess Durg&#257; have taken birth from her womb? Under the circumstances, Ka&#7745;sa, struck with wonder, wanted to compensate for his atrocities against his sister Devak&#299;.</div>

The body undergoes six changes&mdash;birth, growth, sustenance, by-products, dwindling and then annihilation&mdash;but the soul undergoes no such changes. Even after the annihilation of a particular bodily form, the original source of the bodily elements does not change. The living entity enjoys the material body, which appears and disappears, but the five elements earth, water, fire, air and ether remain the same. The example given here is that pots and dolls are produced from the earth, and when broken or destroyed they mingle with their original ingredients. In any case, the source of supply remains the same.</div>
<div class="Purport">As already discussed, the body is made according to the desires of the soul. The soul desires, and thus the body is formed. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a therefore says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index0d72.html?g=5952">18.61</a>):</div>

<div class="Translation">Persons with the vision of differentiation are imbued with the material qualities lamentation, jubilation, fear, envy, greed, illusion and madness.

When a devotee under the protection of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is to suffer because of faults in his past deeds, he passes through only a little misery by the grace of the Lord. Although the disease of a devotee is due to mistakes committed sometime in the past, he agrees to suffer and tolerate such miseries, and he depends fully on the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

<div class="Translation">Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Supersoul within the core of everyone&rsquo;s heart, is the ultimate enemy of the asuras and is therefore known as asura-dvi&#7789;. He is the leader of all the demigods because all the demigods, including Lord &#346;iva and Lord Brahm&#257;, exist under His protection. The great saintly persons, sages and Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas also depend upon Him. To persecute the Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas, therefore, is the only way to kill Vi&#7779;&#7751;u.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The demigods and the Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas especially are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, because they are always obedient to His orders (<span class="Italic">o&#7745; tad vi&#7779;&#7751;o&#7717; parama&#7745; pada&#7745; sad&#257; pa&#347;yanti s&#363;raya&#7717;</span>). The demoniac followers of Ka&#7745;sa thought that if the Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas, saintly persons and sages were persecuted, the original body of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u would naturally be destroyed. Thus they decided to suppress Vai&#7779;&#7751;avism. The <span class="Italic">asuras</span> perpetually struggle to persecute the Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas because they do not want Vai&#7779;&#7751;avism to spread. Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas preach only devotional service, not encouraging <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s, j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s,</span> because if one must liberate oneself from material, conditional life, one must ultimately become a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. Our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is directed with this understanding, and therefore the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> always try to suppress it.</div>

During this great festival, Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja gave in charity to all present whatever they desired. After the festival, Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja put the cowherd men in charge of protecting Gokula, and then he went to Mathur&#257; to pay official taxes to Ka&#7745;sa. In Mathur&#257;, Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja met Vasudeva. Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and Vasudeva were brothers, and Vasudeva praised Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s good fortune because he knew that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a had accepted Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja as His father. When Vasudeva inquired from Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja about the welfare of the child, Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja informed him all about V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, and Vasudeva was very much satisfied by this, although he expressed his grief because Devak&#299;&rsquo;s many children had been killed by Ka&#7745;sa. Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja consoled Vasudeva by saying that everything happens according to destiny and that one who knows this is not aggrieved. Expecting many disturbances in Gokula, Vasudeva then advised Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja not to wait in Mathur&#257;, but to return to V&#7771;nd&#257;vana as soon as possible. Thus Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja took leave of Vasudeva and returned to V&#7771;nd&#257;vana with the other cowherd men on their bullock carts.</div>

<div class="Translation">&#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; said: Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was naturally very magnanimous, and when Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appeared as his son, he was overwhelmed by jubilation. Therefore, after bathing and purifying himself and dressing himself properly, he invited br&#257;hma&#7751;as who knew how to recite Vedic mantras. After having these qualified br&#257;hma&#7751;as recite auspicious Vedic hymns, he arranged to have the Vedic birth ceremony celebrated for his newborn child according to the rules and regulations, and he also arranged for worship of the demigods and forefathers.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura has discussed the significance of the words <span class="Italic">nandas tu.</span> The word <span class="Italic">tu,</span> he says, is not used to fulfill the sentence, because without <span class="Italic">tu</span> the sentence is complete. Therefore the word <span class="Italic">tu</span> is used for a different purpose. Although K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appeared as the son of Devak&#299;, Devak&#299; and Vasudeva did not enjoy the <span class="Italic">j&#257;ta-karma,</span> the festival of the birth ceremony. Instead, this ceremony was enjoyed by Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, as stated here (<span class="Italic">nandas tv &#257;tmaja utpanne j&#257;t&#257;hl&#257;do mah&#257;-man&#257;&#7717;</span>). When Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja met Vasudeva, Vasudeva could not disclose, &ldquo;Your son K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is actually my son. You are His father in a different way, spiritually.&rdquo; Because of fear of Ka&#7745;sa, Vasudeva could not observe the festival for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s birth, Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, however, took full advantage of this opportunity.</div>
<div class="Purport">The <span class="Italic">j&#257;ta-karma</span> ceremony can take place when the umbilical cord, connecting the child and the placenta, is cut. However, since K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was brought by Vasudeva to the house of Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, where was the chance for this to happen? In this regard, Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura desires to prove with evidence from many <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a actually took birth as the son of Ya&#347;od&#257; before the birth of Yogam&#257;y&#257;, who is therefore described as the Lord&rsquo;s younger sister. Even though there may be doubts about the cutting of the umbilical cord, and even though it is possible that this was not done, when the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears, such events are regarded as factual. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appeared as Var&#257;hadeva from the nostril of Brahm&#257;, and therefore Brahm&#257; is described as the father of Var&#257;hadeva. Also significant are the words <span class="Italic">k&#257;ray&#257;m &#257;sa vidhivat.</span> Being overwhelmed with jubilation over the birth of his son, Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja did not see whether the cord was cut or not. Thus he performed the ceremony very gorgeously. According to the opinion of some authorities, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was actually born as the son of Ya&#347;od&#257;. In any case, without regard for material understandings, we can accept that Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s celebration for the ceremony of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s birth was proper. This ceremony is therefore well known everywhere as Nandotsava.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">At an advanced age one generally cannot beget a male child. If by chance one does beget a child at this age, the child is generally female. Thus Vasudeva indirectly asked Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja whether he had actually begotten a male child or a female child. Vasudeva knew that Ya&#347;od&#257; had given birth to a female child, whom he had stolen and replaced with a male child. This was a great mystery, and Vasudeva wanted to determine whether this mystery was already known to Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. On inquiring, however, he was confident that the mystery of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s birth and His being placed in the care of Ya&#347;od&#257; was still hidden. There was no danger, since Ka&#7745;sa at least could not learn what had already happened.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">A summary of the Sixth Chapter is as follows: when Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, following the instructions of Vasudeva, was returning home, he saw a great demoniac woman lying on the road, and then he heard about her death.</div>
</div><A NAME="124048"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">While Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, the King of Vraja, was thinking about Vasudeva&rsquo;s words concerning disturbances in Gokula, he was a little afraid and sought shelter at the lotus feet of &#346;r&#299; Hari. Meanwhile, Ka&#7745;sa sent to the village of Gokula a R&#257;k&#7779;as&#299; named P&#363;tan&#257;, who was wandering here and there killing small babies. Of course, wherever there is no K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, there is the danger of such R&#257;k&#7779;as&#299;s, but since the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself was in Gokula, P&#363;tan&#257; could accept nothing there but her own death.</div>
</div><A NAME="124049"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">One day, P&#363;tan&#257; arrived from outer space in Gokula, the home of Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, and by displaying her mystic power, she assumed the disguise of a very beautiful woman. Taking courage, she immediately entered K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s bedroom without anyone&rsquo;s permission; by the grace of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, no one forbade her to enter the house or the room, because that was K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s desire. The baby K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who resembled a fire covered by ashes, looked upon P&#363;tan&#257; and thought that He would have to kill this demon, the beautiful woman. Enchanted by the influence of <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;</span> and the Personality of Godhead, P&#363;tan&#257; took K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a upon her lap, and neither Rohi&#7751;&#299; nor Ya&#347;od&#257; objected. The demon P&#363;tan&#257; offered her breast for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a to suck, but her breast was smeared with poison. The child K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, therefore, squeezed P&#363;tan&#257;&rsquo;s breast so severely that in unbearable pain she had to assume her original body and fell to the ground. Then K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a began playing on her breast just like a small child. When K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was playing, the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> were pacified and took the child away to their own laps. After this incident, the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> took precautions because of the attack of the R&#257;k&#7779;as&#299;. Mother Ya&#347;od&#257; gave the child her breast to suck and then laid Him in bed.</div>
</div><A NAME="124050"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Meanwhile, Nanda and his associates the cowherd men returned from Mathur&#257;, and when they saw the great dead body of P&#363;tan&#257;, they were struck with wonder. Everyone was astonished that Vasudeva had foretold this mishap, and they praised Vasudeva for his power of foresight. The inhabitants of Vraja cut the gigantic body of P&#363;tan&#257; into pieces, but because K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a had sucked her breast, she had been freed from all sins, and therefore when the cowherd men burned the pieces of her body in a fire, the smoke filled the air with a very pleasing fragrance. Ultimately, although P&#363;tan&#257; had desired to kill K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, she attained the Lord&rsquo;s abode. From this incident we gain the instruction that if one is attached to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a somehow or other, even as an enemy, one ultimately attains success. What then is to be said of devotees who are naturally attached to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in love? When the inhabitants of Vraja heard about the killing of P&#363;tan&#257; and the welfare of the child, they were very much satisfied. Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja took the baby K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a on his lap and was filled with satisfaction.</div>

<div class="Translation">Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the all-pervading Supersoul, lying on the bed, understood that P&#363;tan&#257;, a witch who was expert in killing small children, had come to kill Him. Therefore, as if afraid of her, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a closed His eyes. Thus P&#363;tan&#257; took upon her lap Him who was to be her own annihilation, just as an unintelligent person places a sleeping snake on his lap, thinking the snake to be a rope.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In this verse there are two perplexities. When K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a saw that P&#363;tan&#257; had come to kill Him, He thought that since this woman was present with motherly affection, although artificial, He had to offer her a benediction. Therefore He looked at her with a little perplexity and then closed His eyes again. P&#363;tan&#257; R&#257;k&#7779;as&#299; also was perplexed. She was not intelligent enough to understand that she was taking a sleeping snake on her lap; she thought the snake to be an ordinary rope. The two words <span class="Italic">antakam</span> and <span class="Italic">anantam</span> are contradictory. Because of not being intelligent, P&#363;tan&#257; thought that she could kill her <span class="Italic">antakam,</span> the source of her annihilation; but because He is <span class="Italic">ananta,</span> unlimited, no one can kill Him.</div>

<div class="First">When K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was saved from such a great danger, mother Ya&#347;od&#257; and Rohi&#7751;&#299; were principally concerned, and the other elderly <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s,</span> who were almost equally concerned, followed the activities of mother Ya&#347;od&#257; and Rohi&#7751;&#299;. Here we find that in household affairs, ladies could take charge of protecting a child simply by taking help from the cow. As described here, they knew how to wave about the switch of a cow so as to protect the child from all types of danger. There are so many facilities afforded by cow protection, but people have forgotten these arts. The importance of protecting cows is therefore stressed by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;i-go-rak&#7779;ya-v&#257;&#7751;ijya&#7745; vai&#347;ya-karma svabh&#257;vajam</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index8e55.html?g=5811">18.44</a>]). Even now in the Indian villages surrounding V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, the villagers live happily simply by giving protection to the cow. They keep cow dung very carefully and dry it to use as fuel. They keep a sufficient stock of grains, and because of giving protection to the cows, they have sufficient milk and milk products to solve all economic problems. Simply by giving protection to the cow, the villagers live so peacefully. Even the urine and stool of cows have medicinal value.</div>

<div class="Translation">P&#363;tan&#257; was always hankering for the blood of human children, and with that desire she came to kill K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a; but because she offered her breast to the Lord, she attained the greatest achievement. What then is to be said of those who had natural devotion and affection for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as mothers and who offered Him their breasts to suck or offered something very dear, as a mother offers something to a child?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">P&#363;tan&#257; had no affection for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a; rather, she was envious and wanted to kill Him. Nonetheless, because with or without knowledge she offered her breast, she attained the highest achievement in life. But the offerings of devotees attracted to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in parental love are always sincere. A mother likes to offer something to her child with affection and love; there is no question of envy. So here we can make a comparative study. If P&#363;tan&#257; could attain such an exalted position in spiritual life by neglectfully, enviously making an offering to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, what is to be said of mother Ya&#347;od&#257; and the other <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s,</span> who served K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a with such great affection and love, offering everything for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s satisfaction? The <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> automatically achieved the highest perfection. Therefore &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu recommended the affection of the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s,</span> either in maternal affection or in conjugal love, as the highest perfection in life (<span class="Italic">ramy&#257; k&#257;cid up&#257;san&#257; vrajavadh&#363;-varge&#7751;a y&#257; kalpit&#257;</span>).</div>

Because K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a embraced P&#363;tan&#257;&rsquo;s body with great pleasure and sucked her breast, although she was a great witch, she attained the position of a mother in the transcendental world and thus achieved the highest perfection. What then is to be said of the cows whose nipples K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a sucked with great pleasure and who offered their milk very jubilantly with affection exactly like that of a mother?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">These verses explain how devotional service rendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whether directly or indirectly, knowingly or unknowingly, becomes successful. P&#363;tan&#257; was neither a devotee nor a nondevotee; she was actually a demoniac witch instructed by Ka&#7745;sa to kill K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Nonetheless, in the beginning she assumed the form of a very beautiful woman and approached K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a exactly like an affectionate mother, so that mother Ya&#347;od&#257; and Rohi&#7751;&#299; did not doubt her sincerity. The Lord took all this into consideration, and thus she was automatically promoted to a position like that of mother Ya&#347;od&#257;. As explained by Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura, there are various roles one may play in such a position. P&#363;tan&#257; was immediately promoted to Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka, which is also sometimes described as Svarga. The Svarga mentioned in this verse is not the material heavenly planet, but the transcendental world. In Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka, P&#363;tan&#257; attained the position of a nurse (<span class="Italic">dh&#257;try-ucit&#257;m</span>), as described by Uddhava. P&#363;tan&#257; was elevated to the position of a nurse and maidservant in Goloka V&#7771;nd&#257;vana to assist mother Ya&#347;od&#257;.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, is the bestower of many benedictions, including liberation [kaivalya], or oneness with the Brahman effulgence. For that Personality of Godhead, the gop&#299;s always felt maternal love, and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a sucked their breasts with full satisfaction. Therefore, because of their relationship as mother and son, although the gop&#299;s were engaged in various family activities, one should never think that they returned to this material world after leaving their bodies.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The advantage of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness is described herein. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness gradually develops on the transcendental platform. One may think of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as the supreme personality, one may think of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as the supreme master, one may think of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as the supreme friend, one may think of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as the supreme son, or one may think of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as the supreme conjugal lover. If one is connected with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in any of these transcendental relationships, the course of one&rsquo;s material life is understood to have already ended. As confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexe89d.html?g=1505">4.9</a>), <span class="Italic">tyaktv&#257; deha&#7745; punar janma naiti m&#257;m eti:</span> for such devotees, going back home, back to Godhead, is guaranteed. <span class="Italic">Na puna&#7717; kalpate r&#257;jan sa&#7745;s&#257;ro j&ntilde;&#257;na-sambhava&#7717;.</span> This verse also guarantees that devotees who constantly think of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in a particular relationship will never return to this material world. In this material world of <span class="Italic">sa&#7745;s&#257;ra,</span> there are the same relationships. One thinks, &ldquo;Here is my son,&rdquo; &ldquo;Here is my wife,&rdquo; &ldquo;Here is my lover,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Here is my friend.&rdquo; But these relationships are temporary illusions. <span class="Italic">Aj&ntilde;&#257;na-sambhava&#7717;:</span> such a consciousness awakens in ignorance. But when the same relationships awaken in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, one&rsquo;s spiritual life is revived, and one is guaranteed to return home, back to Godhead. Even though the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> who were friends of Rohi&#7751;&#299; and mother Ya&#347;od&#257; and who allowed their breasts to be sucked by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a were not directly K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s mothers, they all had the same chance as Rohi&#7751;&#299; and Ya&#347;od&#257; to go back to Godhead and act as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s mothers-in-law, servants and so on. The word <span class="Italic">sa&#7745;s&#257;ra</span> refers to attachment for one&rsquo;s body, home, husband or wife, and children, but although the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> and all the other inhabitants of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana had the same affection and attachment for husband and home, their central affection was for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in some transcendental relationship, and therefore they were guaranteed to be promoted to Goloka V&#7771;nd&#257;vana in the next life, to live with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a eternally in spiritual happiness. The easiest way to attain spiritual elevation, to be liberated from this material world, and to go back home, back to Godhead, is recommended by Bhaktivinoda &#7788;h&#257;kura: <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;era sa&#7745;s&#257;ra kara ch&#257;&#7693;i&rsquo; an&#257;c&#257;ra.</span> One should give up all sinful activities and remain in the family of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Then one&rsquo;s liberation is guaranteed.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">When &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; saw that Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was eagerly waiting to hear about Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s pastimes as a child, he was very much pleased, and he continued to speak. When &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was only three months old and was just trying to turn backside up, before He even attempted to crawl, mother Ya&#347;od&#257; wanted to observe a ritualistic ceremony with her friends for the good fortune of the child. Such a ritualistic ceremony is generally performed with ladies who also have small children. When mother Ya&#347;od&#257; saw that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was falling asleep, because of other engagements she put the child underneath a household cart, called <span class="Italic">&#347;aka&#7789;a,</span> and while the child was sleeping, she engaged herself in other business pertaining to the auspicious ritualistic ceremony. Underneath the cart was a cradle, and mother Ya&#347;od&#257; placed the child in that cradle. The child was sleeping, but suddenly He awakened and, as usual for a child, began to kick His small legs. This kicking shook the cart, which collapsed with a great sound, breaking completely and spilling all its contents. Children who were playing nearby immediately informed mother Ya&#347;od&#257; that the cart had broken, and therefore she hastily arrived there in great anxiety with the other <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s.</span> Mother Ya&#347;od&#257; immediately took the child on her lap and allowed Him to suck her breast. Then various types of Vedic ritualistic ceremonies were performed with the help of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> Not knowing the real identity of the child, the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> showered the child with blessings.</div>
</div><A NAME="124531"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Another day, when mother Ya&#347;od&#257; was sitting with her child on her lap, she suddenly observed that he had assumed the weight of the entire universe. She was so astonished that she had to put the child down, and in the meantime T&#7771;&#7751;&#257;varta, one of the servants of Ka&#7745;sa, appeared there as a whirlwind and took the child away. The whole tract of land known as Gokula became surcharged with dust, no one could see where the child had been taken, and all the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> were overwhelmed because He had been taken away in the dust storm. But up in the sky, the <span class="Italic">asura,</span> being overburdened by the child, could not carry the child far away, although he also could not drop the child because the child had caught him so tightly that it was difficult for him to separate the child from his body. Thus T&#7771;&#7751;&#257;varta himself fell down from a very great height, the child grasping him tightly by the shoulder, and immediately died. The demon having fallen, the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> picked the child up and delivered Him to the lap of mother Ya&#347;od&#257;. Thus mother Ya&#347;od&#257; was struck with wonder, but because of <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;&rsquo;s</span> influence, no one could understand who K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was and what had actually happened. Rather, everyone began to praise fortune for the child&rsquo;s having been saved from such a calamity. Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, of course, was thinking of the wonderful foretelling of Vasudeva and began to praise him as a great <span class="Italic">yog&#299;.</span> Later, when the child was on the lap of mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, the child yawned, and mother Ya&#347;od&#257; could see within His mouth the entire universal manifestation.</div>

All the Vedic literatures presented by Vy&#257;sadeva and other great sages are therefore intended to revive our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, which begins to revive with <span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;a-k&#299;rtanam.</span> <span class="Italic">&#346;&#7771;&#7751;vat&#257;&#7745; sva-kath&#257;&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&#7717;</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="index03ec.html?g=6478">1.2.17</a>). <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> and other Vedic literatures exist simply to give us a chance to hear about K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.

First of all, however, we have no attraction for hearing about K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and this is the root cause of our suffering.</div>
<div class="Purport">But Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja specifically mentions that the wonderful activities of baby K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, which amazed mother Ya&#347;od&#257; and the other inhabitants of Vraja, are especially attractive. From the very beginning of His childhood, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a killed P&#363;tan&#257;, T&#7771;&#7751;&#257;varta and &#346;aka&#7789;&#257;sura and showed the entire universe within His mouth. Thus the pastimes of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, one after another, kept mother Ya&#347;od&#257; and all the inhabitants of Vraja in great astonishment. The process to revive one&rsquo;s K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness is <span class="Italic">&#257;dau &#347;raddh&#257; tata&#7717; s&#257;dhu-sa&#7749;ga&#7717;</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bhakti-ras&#257;m&#7771;ta-sindhu</span> 1.4.15). The pastimes of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a can be properly received from devotees. If one has developed a little bit of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness by hearing from Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas about the activities of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, one becomes attached to Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas who are interested only in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. Therefore Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja recommends that one hear about K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s childhood activities, which are more attractive than the activities of other incarnations, such as Matsya, K&#363;rma and Var&#257;ha. Wanting to hear more and more from &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it requested him to continue describing K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s childhood activities, which are especially easy to hear and which create more and more inquisitiveness.</div>

The Supreme Personality of Godhead incarnates at different times in different planets and universes, and according to the nature of those places, He exhibits His unlimited potency. That a child sitting on the lap of his mother was able to kill the gigantic P&#363;tan&#257; is extremely wonderful for the inhabitants of this planet, but on other planets the inhabitants are more advanced, and therefore the pastimes the Lord performs there are still more wonderful.

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">&#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; said: When mother Ya&#347;od&#257;&rsquo;s baby was slanting His body to attempt to rise and turn around, this attempt was observed by a Vedic ceremony. In such a ceremony, called utth&#257;na, which is performed when a child is due to leave the house for the first time, the child is properly bathed. Just after K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a turned three months old, mother Ya&#347;od&#257; celebrated this ceremony with other women of the neighborhood. On that day, there was a conjunction of the moon with the constellation Rohi&#7751;&#299;. As the br&#257;hma&#7751;as joined by chanting Vedic hymns and professional musicians also took part, this great ceremony was observed by mother Ya&#347;od&#257;</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">There is no question of overpopulation or of children&rsquo;s being a burden for their parents in a Vedic society. Such a society is so well organized and people are so advanced in spiritual consciousness that childbirth is never regarded as a burden or a botheration. The more a child grows, the more his parents become jubilant, and the child&rsquo;s attempts to turn over are also a source of jubilation. Even before the child is born, when the mother is pregnant, many recommended ritualistic ceremonies are performed. For example, when the child has been within the womb for three months and for seven months, there is a ceremony the mother observes by eating with neighboring children. This ceremony is called <span class="Italic">sv&#257;da-bhak&#7779;a&#7751;a.</span> Similarly, before the birth of the child there is the <span class="Italic">garbh&#257;dh&#257;na</span> ceremony. In Vedic civilization, childbirth or pregnancy is never regarded as a burden; rather, it is a cause for jubilation. In contrast, people in modern civilization do not like pregnancy or childbirth, and when there is a child, they sometimes kill it. We can just consider how human society has fallen since the inauguration of Kali-yuga. Although people still claim to be civilized, at the present moment there is actually no human civilization, but only an assembly of two-legged animals.</div>

<div class="Translation">The liberal mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, absorbed in celebrating the utth&#257;na ceremony, was busy receiving guests, worshiping them with all respect and offering them clothing, cows, garlands and grains. Thus she could not hear the child crying for His mother.

Now, on the plea of demanding to suck His mother&rsquo;s breast, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a took this opportunity to kill the demon. Thus He kicked &#346;aka&#7789;&#257;sura just to expose him. Although K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s mother was engaged in receiving guests, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a wanted to draw her attention by killing the &#346;aka&#7789;&#257;sura, and therefore he kicked that cart-shaped demon. Such are the pastimes of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a wanted to draw the attention of His mother, but while doing so He created a great havoc not understandable by ordinary persons. These narrations are wonderfully enjoyable, and those who are fortunate are struck with wonder upon hearing of these extraordinary activities of the Lord. Although the less intelligent regard them as mythological because a dull brain cannot understand them, they are real facts. These narrations are actually so enjoyable and enlightening that Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it and &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; took pleasure in them, and other liberated persons, following in their footsteps, become fully jubilant by hearing about the wonderful activities of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation">Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was lying down underneath the handcart in one corner of the courtyard, and although His little legs were as soft as leaves, when He struck the cart with His legs, it turned over violently and collapsed.

On the cart there were many little utensils made of various metals, and all of them scattered hither and thither.</div>

<div class="First">&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura has commented on this verse as follows. When Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was of a very tender age, His hands and legs resembled soft new leaves, yet simply by touching the handcart with His legs, He made the cart fall to pieces. It was quite possible for Him to act in this way and yet not exert Himself very much. The Lord in His V&#257;mana <span class="Italic">avat&#257;ra</span> had to extend His foot to the greatest height to penetrate the covering of the universe, and when the Lord killed the gigantic demon Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, He had to assume the special bodily feature of N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva. But in His K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">avat&#257;ra,</span> the Lord did not need to exert such energy. Therefore, <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;as tu bhagav&#257;n svayam:</span> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. In other incarnations, the Lord had to exert some energy according to the time and circumstances, but in this form He exhibited unlimited potency. Thus the handcart collapsed, its joints broken, and all the metal pots and utensils scattered.</div>
<div class="Purport">The <span class="Italic">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-to&#7779;a&#7751;&#299;</span> remarks that although the handcart was higher than the child, the child could easily touch the wheel of the cart, and this was sufficient to send the demon down to the earth. The Lord simultaneously pushed the demon to the earth and superficially broke the handcart.</div>

<div class="First">We have heard of people&rsquo;s being haunted by ghosts. Having no gross material body, a ghost seeks shelter of a gross body to stay in and haunt. The &#346;aka&#7789;&#257;sura was a ghost who had taken shelter of the handcart and was looking for the opportunity to do mischief to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. When K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a kicked the cart with His small and very delicate legs, the ghost was immediately pushed down to the earth and his shelter dismantled, as already described. This was possible for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a because He has full potency, as confirmed in the <span class="Ref_Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> (5.32):</div>

Also, when the handcart broke, an ordinary child could have been injured in many ways, but because K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He enjoyed the dismantling of the cart, and nothing injured Him.

Those who enjoy the activities of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a are also on the platform of <span class="Italic">&#257;nanda-cinmaya-rasa;</span> they are liberated from the material platform.

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">When br&#257;hma&#7751;as are free from envy, untruthfulness, unnecessary pride, grudges, disturbance by the opulence of others, and false prestige, their blessings never go in vain. Considering this, Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja soberly took K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a on his lap and invited such truthful br&#257;hma&#7751;as to perform a ritualistic ceremony according to the holy hymns of the S&#257;ma Veda, &#7770;g Veda and Yajur Veda. Then, while the hymns were being chanted, he bathed the child with water mixed with pure herbs, and after performing a fire ceremony, he sumptuously fed all the br&#257;hma&#7751;as with first-class grains and other food.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was very confident about the qualifications of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and their blessings. He was fully confident that simply if the good <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> showered their blessings, the child K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a would be happy. The blessings of qualified <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> can bring happiness not only to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but to everyone. Because K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is self-sufficient, He does not require anyone&rsquo;s blessings, yet Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja thought that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a required the blessings of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> What then is to be said of others? In human society, therefore, there must be an ideal class of men, <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> who can bestow blessings upon others, namely, upon the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas, vai&#347;yas</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras,</span> so that everyone will be happy. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a therefore says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexd112.html?g=1541">4.13</a>) that human society must have four social orders (<span class="Italic">c&#257;tur-var&#7751;ya&#7745; may&#257; s&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;a&#7745; gu&#7751;a-karma-vibh&#257;ga&#347;a&#7717;</span>); it is not that everyone should become a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> or a <span class="Italic">vai&#347;ya</span> and human society will prosper. As enunciated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> there must be a class of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> with qualities like <span class="Italic">satya</span> (truthfulness), <span class="Italic">&#347;ama</span> (peacefulness), <span class="Italic">dama</span> (self-control) and <span class="Italic">titik&#7779;&#257;</span> (tolerance).</div>
<div class="Purport">Here also, in the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja invites qualified <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> There may be caste <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> and we have all respect for them, but their birth in <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> families does not mean that they are qualified to bestow blessings upon the other members of human society. This is the verdict of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras.</span> In Kali-yuga, caste <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are accepted as <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> <span class="Italic">Vipratve s&#363;tram eva hi</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> 12.2.3): in Kali-yuga, simply by putting on a thread worth two <span class="Italic">paise,</span> one becomes a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> Such <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> were not called for by Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. As stated by N&#257;rada Muni (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="indexa51a.html?g=58205">7.11.35</a>), <span class="Italic">yasya yal lak&#7779;a&#7751;a&#7745; proktam.</span> The symptoms of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> are stated in <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra,</span> and one must be qualified with these symptoms.</div>
<div class="Purport">The blessings of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> who are not envious, disturbed or puffed up with pride and false prestige and who are fully qualified with truthfulness will be useful. Therefore a class of men must be trained as <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> from the very beginning. <span class="Italic">Brahmac&#257;r&#299; guru-kule vasan d&#257;nto guror hitam</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="index0fc2.html?g=58216">7.12.1</a>). The word <span class="Italic">d&#257;nta&#7717;</span> is very important. <span class="Italic">D&#257;nta&#7717;</span> refers to one who is not envious, disturbing or puffed up with false prestige. With the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, we are trying to introduce such <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> in society. <span class="Italic">Br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> must ultimately be Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas, and if one is a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, he has already acquired the qualifications of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> <span class="Italic">Brahma-bh&#363;ta&#7717; prasann&#257;tm&#257;</span> (Bg. <a href="indexc2a1.html?g=5889">18.54</a>). The word <span class="Italic">brahma-bh&#363;ta</span> refers to becoming a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> or understanding what is Brahman (<span class="Italic">brahma j&#257;n&#257;t&#299;ti br&#257;hma&#7751;a&#7717;</span>). One who is <span class="Italic">brahma-bh&#363;ta</span> is always happy (<span class="Italic">prasann&#257;tm&#257;</span>). <span class="Italic">Na &#347;ocati na k&#257;&#7749;k&#7779;ati:</span> he is never disturbed about material necessities. <span class="Italic">Sama&#7717; sarve&#7779;u bh&#363;te&#7779;u:</span> he is ready to bestow blessings upon everyone equally. <span class="Italic">Mad-bhakti&#7745; labhate par&#257;m:</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexc2a1.html?g=5889">18.54</a>] then he becomes a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. In this age, &#346;r&#299;la Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura introduced the sacred thread ceremony for his Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava disciples, with the idea that people should understand that when one becomes a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava he has already acquired the qualifications of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> Therefore in the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, those who are twice initiated so as to become <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> must bear in mind their great responsibility to be truthful, control the mind and senses, be tolerant, and so on. Then their life will be successful. It was such <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> that Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja invited to chant the Vedic hymns, not ordinary <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> Verse thirteen distinctly mentions <span class="Italic">hi&#7745;s&#257;-m&#257;na.</span> The word <span class="Italic">m&#257;na</span> refers to false prestige or false pride. Those who were falsely proud, thinking that they were <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> because they were born in <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> families, were never invited by Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja on such occasions.</div>
<div class="Purport">Verse fourteen mentions <span class="Italic">pavitrau&#7779;adhi.</span> In any ritualistic ceremony, many herbs and leaves were required. These were known as <span class="Italic">pavitra-patra.</span> Sometimes there were <span class="Italic">nimba</span> leaves, sometimes bael leaves, mango leaves, <span class="Italic">a&#347;vattha</span> leaves or <span class="Italic">&#257;malak&#299;</span> leaves. Similarly, there were <span class="Italic">pa&ntilde;ca-gavya, pa&ntilde;ca-&#347;asya</span> and <span class="Italic">pa&ntilde;ca-ratna.</span> Although Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja belonged to the <span class="Italic">vai&#347;ya</span> community, everything was known to him.</div>
<div class="Purport">The most important word in these verses is <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-gu&#7751;am,</span> indicating that the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> were offered very palatable food of exalted quality. Such palatable dishes were generally prepared with two things, namely food grains and milk products. <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index8e55.html?g=5811">18.44</a>) therefore enjoins that human society must give protection to the cows and encourage agriculture (<span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;i-go-rak&#7779;ya-v&#257;&#7751;ijya&#7745; vai&#347;ya-karma svabh&#257;vajam</span>). Simply by expert cooking, hundreds and thousands of palatable dishes can be prepared from agricultural produce and milk products. This is indicated here by the words <span class="Italic">anna&#7745; mah&#257;-gu&#7751;am.</span> Still today in India, from these two things, namely food grains and milk, hundreds and thousands of varieties of food are prepared, and then they are offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. (<span class="Italic">Catur-vidha-&#347;r&#299;-bhagavat-pras&#257;da.</span> <span class="Italic">patra&#7745; pu&#7779;pa&#7745; phala&#7745; toya&#7745; yo me bhakty&#257; prayacchati .</span>) Then the <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da</span> is distributed. Even today in Jagann&#257;tha-k&#7779;etra and other big temples, very palatable dishes are offered to the Deity, and <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da</span> is distributed profusely. Cooked by first-class <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> with expert knowledge and then distributed to the public, this <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da</span> is also a blessing from the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> or Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas. There are four kinds of <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da</span> (<span class="Italic">catur-vidha</span>). Salty, sweet, sour and pungent tastes are made with different types of spices, and the food is prepared in four divisions, called <span class="Italic">carvya, c&#363;&#7779;ya, lehya</span> and <span class="Italic">pehya&mdash;pras&#257;da</span> that is chewed, <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da</span> that is licked, <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da</span> tasted with the tongue, and <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da</span> that is drunk. Thus there are many varieties of <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da,</span> prepared very nicely with grains and ghee, offered to the Deity and distributed to the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas and then to the general public. This is the way of human society. Killing the cows and spoiling the land will not solve the problem of food. This is not civilization. Uncivilized men living in the jungle and being unqualified to produce food by agriculture and cow protection may eat animals, but a perfect human society advanced in knowledge must learn how to produce first-class food simply by agriculture and protection of cows.</div>

Therefore, because He is the source of everything (<span class="Italic">janm&#257;dy asya yata&#7717;</I> [SB </I><a href="index4dab.html?g=6120">1.1.1</a></I>]</span></I>), He assumed the heaviness of the entire universe. The child was on the lap of Ya&#347;od&#257;, who was therefore in possession of everything in the world, but when the child assumed such heaviness, she had to put Him down in order to give T&#7771;&#7751;&#257;vart&#257;sura an opportunity to take Him away and play with Him for some time before the child returned to the lap of His mother.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Here is a competition in yogic power between K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and T&#7771;&#7751;&#257;vart&#257;sura. By practicing mystic <span class="Italic">yoga, asuras</span> generally attain some perfection in the eight <span class="Italic">siddhis,</span> or perfections, namely <span class="Italic">a&#7751;im&#257;, laghim&#257;, mahim&#257;, pr&#257;pti, pr&#257;k&#257;mya, &#299;&#347;itva, va&#347;itva</span> and <span class="Italic">k&#257;m&#257;vas&#257;yit&#257;.</span> But although a demon may acquire such powers to a very limited extent, he cannot compete with the mystic power of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is Yoge&#347;vara, the source of all mystic power (<span class="Italic">yatra yoge&#347;varo hari&#7717;</span>). No one can compete with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Sometimes, of course, having acquired a fragmental portion of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s mystic power, <span class="Italic">asuras</span> demonstrate their power to the foolish public and assert themselves to be God, not knowing that God is the supreme Yoge&#347;vara. Here also we see that T&#7771;&#7751;&#257;varta assumed the <span class="Italic">mahim&#257;-siddhi</span> and took K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a away as if K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a were an ordinary child. But K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a also became a mystic <span class="Italic">mahim&#257;-siddha.</span> When mother Ya&#347;od&#257; was carrying Him, He became so heavy that His mother, who was usually accustomed to carrying Him, could not bear Him and had to place Him down on the ground. Thus T&#7771;&#7751;&#257;varta had been able to take K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a away in the presence of mother Ya&#347;od&#257;. But when K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, high in the sky, assumed the <span class="Italic">mahim&#257;-siddhi,</span> the demon, unable to go further, was obliged to stop his force and come down according to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s desire. One should not, therefore, compete with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s mystic power.</div>
<div class="Purport">Devotees automatically have all mystic power, but they do not like to compete with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Instead, they fully surrender to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and their yogic power is demonstrated by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s mercy. Devotees can show mystic <span class="Italic">yoga</span> so powerful that a demon could not even dream of it, but they never try to demonstrate it for their personal sense gratification. Whatever they do is for the service of the Lord, and therefore they are always in a position superior to that of the demons. There are many <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s, yog&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s</span> who artificially try to compete with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and thus ordinary, foolish people who do not care to hear <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> from authorities consider some rascal <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> to be Bhagav&#257;n, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. At the present moment there are many so-called <span class="Italic">b&#257;b&#257;s</span> who present themselves as incarnations of God by showing some insignificant mystic wonder, and foolish people regard them as God because of lacking knowledge of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>

One of the processes of surrender is that one should simply depend on K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, convinced that He will give one all protection. That K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a will protect His devotee is a fact, and Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and the other inhabitants of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana accepted this very simply, although they did not know that the Supreme Lord Himself was present before them. There have been many instances in which a devotee like Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja or Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja has been put in difficulty even by his father but has been saved under all circumstances. Therefore our only business is to become K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious and depend fully on K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a for all protection.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The summary of the Eighth Chapter is as follows. This chapter describes the ceremony of giving a name to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. It also describes His crawling, His playing with the cows, and His eating earth and again showing the universal form to His mother.</div>
</div><A NAME="124992"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">One day, Vasudeva sent for Gargamuni, the family priest of the <span class="Italic">yadu-va&#7745;&#347;a,</span> and thus Gargamuni went to the house of Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, who received him very well and requested him to give names to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and Balar&#257;ma. Gargamuni, of course, reminded Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja that Ka&#7745;sa was looking for the son of Devak&#299; and said that if he performed the ceremony very gorgeously, the ceremony would come to the notice of Ka&#7745;sa, who would then suspect that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was the son of Devak&#299;. Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja therefore requested Gargamuni to perform this ceremony without anyone&rsquo;s knowledge, and Gargamuni did so. Because Balar&#257;ma, the son of Rohi&#7751;&#299;, increases the transcendental bliss of others, His name is R&#257;ma, and because of His extraordinary strength, He is called Baladeva. He attracts the Yadus to follow His instructions, and therefore His name is Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the son of Ya&#347;od&#257;, previously appeared in many other colors, such as white, red and yellow, and He had now assumed the color black. Because He was sometimes the son of Vasudeva, His name is V&#257;sudeva. According to His various activities and qualities, He has many other names. After thus informing Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and completing the name-giving ceremony, Gargamuni advised Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja to protect his son very carefully and then departed.</div>
</div><A NAME="124993"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">&#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; next described how the two children crawled, walked on Their small legs, played with the cows and calves, stole butter and other milk products and broke the butter pots. In this way, he described many naughty activities of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and Balar&#257;ma. The most wonderful of these occurred when K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s playmates complained to mother Ya&#347;od&#257; that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was eating earth. Mother Ya&#347;od&#257; wanted to open K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s mouth to see the evidence so that she could chastise Him. Sometimes she assumed the position of a chastising mother, and at the next moment she was overwhelmed with maternal love. After describing all this to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, at Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it&rsquo;s request, praised the fortune of mother Ya&#347;od&#257; and Nanda. Nanda and Ya&#347;od&#257; were formerly Dro&#7751;a and Dhar&#257;, and by the order of Brahm&#257; they came to this earth and had the Supreme Personality of Godhead as their son.</div>

<div class="First">As factually stated by Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, Gargamuni, being a devotee, had no needs. Similarly, when K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a comes He has no needs, for He is <span class="Italic">p&#363;r&#7751;a, &#257;tm&#257;r&#257;ma.</span> Nonetheless, He descends to this material world to protect the devotees and vanquish miscreants (<span class="Italic">paritr&#257;&#7751;&#257;ya s&#257;dh&#363;n&#257;&#7745; vin&#257;&#347;&#257;ya ca du&#7779;k&#7771;t&#257;m</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexb53f.html?g=1496">4.8</a>]).

One who executes this mission of <span class="Italic">para-upak&#257;ra,</span> performing welfare activities for people in general, is recognized by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as being very, very dear to Him (<span class="Italic">na ca tasm&#257;n manu&#7779;ye&#7779;u ka&#347;cin me priya-k&#7771;ttama&#7717;</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexaa3c.html?g=6024">18.69</a>]). Similarly, Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu has advised this <span class="Italic">para-upak&#257;ra,</span> and He has especially advised the inhabitants of India:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">bh&#257;rata-bh&#363;mite haila manu&#7779;ya-janma y&#257;ra<br>janma s&#257;rthaka kari&rsquo; kara para-upak&#257;ra</div>

<div class="Purport">Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja could understand that Gargamuni had come for this purpose and that his own duty now was to act according to Gargamuni&rsquo;s advice. Thus he said, &ldquo;Please tell me what is my duty.&rdquo; This should be the attitude of everyone, especially the householder. The <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</span> society is organized into eight divisions: <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a, k&#7779;atriya, vai&#347;ya, &#347;&#363;dra, brahmacarya, g&#7771;hastha, v&#257;naprastha</span> and <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa.</span> Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja represented himself as <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hi&#7751;&#257;m,</span> a householder. A <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> factually has no needs, but <span class="Italic">g&#7771;h&#299;,</span> householders, are engaged in sense gratification. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexf1a4.html?g=776">2.44</a>), <span class="Italic">bhogai&#347;varya-prasakt&#257;n&#257;&#7745; tay&#257;pah&#7771;ta-cetas&#257;m.</span> Everyone has come to this material world for sense gratification, and the position of those who are too attached to sense gratification and who therefore accept the <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha-&#257;&#347;rama</span> is very precarious. Since everyone in this material world is searching for sense gratification, <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hasthas</span> are required to be trained as <span class="Italic">mahat,</span> great <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;s.</span> Therefore Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja specifically used the word <span class="Italic">mahad-vicalanam.</span> Gargamuni had no interest to serve by going to Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, but Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, as a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha,</span> was always perfectly ready to receive instructions from a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;</span> to gain the real benefit in life. Thus he was ready to execute Gargamuni&rsquo;s order.</div>

<div class="Translation">O great saintly person, you have compiled the astrological knowledge by which one can understand past and present unseen things. By the strength of this knowledge, any human being can understand what he has done in his past life and how it affects his present life. This is known to you.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The word &ldquo;destiny&rdquo; is now defined. Unintelligent persons who do not understand the meaning of life are just like animals. Animals do not know the past, present and future of life, nor are they able to understand it. But a human being can understand this, if he is sober. Therefore, as stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexf962.html?g=502">2.13</a>), <span class="Italic">dh&#299;ras tatra na muhyati:</span> a sober person is not bewildered. The simple truth is that although life is eternal, in this material world one changes from one body to another. Foolish people, especially in this age, do not understand this simple truth. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">dehino &rsquo;smin yath&#257; dehe<br>kaum&#257;ra&#7745; yauvana&#7745; jar&#257;<br>tath&#257; deh&#257;ntara-pr&#257;ptir<br>dh&#299;ras tatra na muhyati</div>
</div><A NAME="125058"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.&rdquo; (Bg. <a href="indexf962.html?g=502">2.13</a>) K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the greatest authority, says that the body will change. And as soon as the body changes, one&rsquo;s whole program of work changes also. Today I am a human being or a great personality, but with a little deviation from nature&rsquo;s law, I shall have to accept a different type of body. Today I am a human being, but tomorrow I may become a dog, and then whatever activities I have performed in this life will be a failure. This simple truth is now rarely understood, but one who is a <span class="Italic">dh&#299;ra</span> can understand this. Those in this material world for material enjoyment should know that because their present position will cease to exist, they must be careful in how they act. This is also stated by &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva. <span class="Italic">Na s&#257;dhu manye yata &#257;tmano &rsquo;yam asann api kle&#347;ada &#257;sa deha&#7717;</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="index404a.html?g=42765">5.5.4</a>). Although this body is temporary, as long as we have to live in this body we must suffer. Whether one has a short life or a long life, one must suffer the threefold miseries of material life. Therefore any gentleman, <span class="Italic">dh&#299;ra,</span> must be interested in <span class="Italic">jyoti&#7779;a,</span> astrology.</div>
<div class="Purport">Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was trying to take advantage of the opportunity afforded by Gargamuni&rsquo;s presence, for Gargamuni was a great authority in this knowledge of astrology, by which one can see the unseen events of past, present and future. It is the duty of a father to understand the astrological position of his children and do what is needed for their happiness. Now, taking advantage of the opportunity afforded by the presence of Gargamuni, Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja suggested that Gargamuni prepare a horoscope for Nanda&rsquo;s two sons, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and Balar&#257;ma.</div>

The <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are required for the guidance of the whole society. If there is no such institution as <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> and if human society has no such guide as the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> human society will be hellish. In Kali-yuga, especially at the present moment, there is no such thing as a real <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> and therefore society is in a chaotic condition. Formerly there were qualified <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> but at present, although there are certainly persons who think themselves <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> they actually have no ability to guide society. The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is therefore very much eager to reintroduce the <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</span> system into human society so that those who are bewildered or less intelligent will be able to take guidance from qualified <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span></div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> means Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. After one becomes a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> the next stage of development in human society is to become a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. People in general must be guided to the destination or goal of life, and therefore they must understand Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The whole system of Vedic knowledge is based on this principle, but people have lost the clue (<span class="Italic">na te vidu&#7717; sv&#257;rtha-gati&#7745; hi vi&#7779;&#7751;um</I> [SB </span></I><a href="index2706.html?g=55424">7.5.31</a>]), and they are simply pursuing sense gratification, with the risk of gliding down to a lower grade of life (<span class="Italic">m&#7771;tyu-sa&#7745;s&#257;ra-vartmani</span>). It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether one is born a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> or not. No one is born a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a;</span> everyone is born a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra.</span> But by the guidance of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> and by <span class="Italic">sa&#7745;sk&#257;ra,</span> one can become <span class="Italic">dvija,</span> twice-born, and then gradually become a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> Br&#257;hma&#7751;ism is not a system meant to create a monopoly for a particular class of men. Everyone should be educated so as to become a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> At least there must be an opportunity to allow everyone to attain the destination of life. Regardless of whether one is born in a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> family, a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> family or a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> family, one may be guided by a proper <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> and be promoted to the highest platform of being a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. Thus the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement affords an opportunity to develop the right destiny for human society. Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja took advantage of the opportunity of Gargamuni&rsquo;s presence by requesting him to perform the necessary reformatory activities for his sons to guide Them toward the destination of life.</div>

<div class="Translation">Your son K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appears as an incarnation in every millennium. In the past, He assumed three different colors&mdash;white, red and yellow&mdash;and now He has appeared in a blackish color.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Partially explaining the position of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and partially covering the facts, Gargamuni indicated, &ldquo;Your son is a great personality, and He can change the color of His body in different ages.&rdquo; The word <span class="Italic">g&#7771;h&#7751;ata&#7717;</span> indicates that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is free to make His choice. In other words, He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and may therefore do whatever He desires. In Vedic literature the different colors assumed by the Personality of Godhead in different millenniums are stated, and therefore when Gargamuni said, &ldquo;Your son has assumed these colors,&rdquo; he indirectly said, &ldquo;He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.&rdquo; Because of Ka&#7745;sa&rsquo;s atrocities, Gargamuni tried to avoid disclosing this fact, but he indirectly informed Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, his son, was the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purport">It may be noted that &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;, in his book <span class="Italic">Krama-sandarbha,</span> has enunciated the purport of this verse. In every millennium, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appears in a different form, either as white, red or yellow, but this time He personally appeared in His original, blackish form and, as predicted by Gargamuni, exhibited the power of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. Because in this form the Supreme Personality of Godhead exhibits Himself fully, His name is &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the all-attractive.</div>
<div class="Purport">Factually, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the source of all <span class="Italic">avat&#257;ras,</span> and therefore all the different features of the different <span class="Italic">avat&#257;ras</span> are present in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. When K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a incarnates, all the features of other incarnations are already present within Him. Other incarnations are partial representations of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who is the full-fledged incarnation of the Supreme Being. It is to be understood that the Supreme Being, whether appearing as <span class="Italic">&#347;ukla, rakta</span> or <span class="Italic">p&#299;ta</span> (white, red or yellow), is the same person. When He appears in different incarnations, He appears in different colors, just like the sunshine, which contains seven colors. Sometimes the colors of sunshine are represented separately; otherwise the sunshine is observed mainly as bright light. The different <span class="Italic">avat&#257;ras,</span> such as the <span class="Italic">manvantara-avat&#257;ras, l&#299;l&#257;-avat&#257;ras</span> and <span class="Italic">da&#347;a-avat&#257;ras,</span> are all included in the <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-avat&#257;ra.</span> When K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appears, all the <span class="Italic">avat&#257;ras</span> appear with Him.

<div class="First"><span class="Italic">Bah&#363;ni:</span> the Lord has many names. <span class="Italic">Advaitam acyutam an&#257;dim ananta-r&#363;pam &#257;dya&#7745; pur&#257;&#7751;a-puru&#7779;a&#7745; nava-yauvana&#7745; ca.</span> As stated in the <span class="Ref_Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> (5.33), the Lord is one, but He has many forms and many names. It was not that because Gargamuni gave the child the name K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, that was His only name. He has other names, such as Bhaktavatsala, Giridh&#257;r&#299;, Govinda and Gop&#257;la. If we analyze the <span class="Italic">nirukti,</span> or semantic derivation, of the word &ldquo;K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a,&rdquo; we find that <span class="Italic">na</span> signifies that He stops the repetition of birth and death, and <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;</span> means <span class="Italic">satt&#257;rtha,</span> or &ldquo;existence.&rdquo; (K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the whole of existence.) Also, <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;</span> means &ldquo;attraction,&rdquo; and <span class="Italic">na</span> means <span class="Italic">&#257;nanda,</span> or &ldquo;bliss.&rdquo; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is known as Mukunda because He wants to give everyone spiritual, eternal, blissful life. Unfortunately, because of the living entity&rsquo;s little independence, the living entity wants to &ldquo;deprogram&rdquo; the program of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. This is the material disease. Nonetheless, because K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a wants to give transcendental bliss to the living entities, He appears in various forms. Therefore He is called K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Because Gargamuni was an astrologer, he knew what others did not know. Yet K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a has so many names that even Gargamuni did not know them all. It is to be concluded that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, according to His transcendental activities, has many names and many forms.</div>

When caught by the master of the house, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a would chastise him, saying, &ldquo;You are a thief.&rdquo; Aside from being a thief in His childhood affairs, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a acted as an expert thief when He was young by attracting young girls and enjoying them in the <span class="Italic">r&#257;sa</span> dance. This is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s business. He is also violent, as the killer of many demons. Although mundane people like nonviolence and other such brilliant qualities, God, the Absolute Truth, being always the same, is good in any activities, even so-called immoral activities like stealing, killing and violence. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is always pure, and He is always the Supreme Absolute Truth. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a may do anything supposedly abominable in material life, yet still He is attractive. Therefore His name is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, meaning &ldquo;all-attractive.&rdquo; This is the platform on which transcendental loving affairs and service are exchanged. Because of the features of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s face, the mothers were so attracted that they could not chastise Him. Instead of chastising Him, they smiled and enjoyed hearing of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s activities. Thus the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> remained satisfied, and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a enjoyed their happiness. Therefore another name of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is Gop&#299;-jana-vallabha because He invented such activities to please the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s.</span></div>

I am an insignificant woman with no connection with the demigods. Why should they take the trouble to put me into <span class="Italic">devam&#257;y&#257;</span>? That also is not possible.&rdquo; Then mother Ya&#347;od&#257; considered whether the vision might be due to bewilderment: &ldquo;I am fit in health; I am not diseased. Why should there be any bewilderment? It is not possible that my brain is deranged, since I am ordinarily quite fit to think. Then this vision must be due to some mystic power of my son, as predicted by Gargamuni.&rdquo; Thus she finally concluded that the vision was due to her son&rsquo;s activities, and nothing else.</div>

<div class="Translation">Therefore let me surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead and offer my obeisances unto Him, who is beyond the conception of human speculation, the mind, activities, words and arguments, who is the original cause of this cosmic manifestation, by whom the entire cosmos is maintained, and by whom we can conceive of its existence. Let me simply offer my obeisances, for He is beyond my contemplation, speculation and meditation. He is beyond all of my material activities.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">One simply has to realize the greatness of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should not try to understand Him by any material means, subtle or gross. Mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, being a simple woman, could not find out the real cause of the vision; therefore, out of maternal affection, she simply offered obeisances unto the Supreme Lord to protect her child. She could do nothing but offer obeisances to the Lord. It is said, <span class="Italic">acinty&#257;&#7717; khalu ye bh&#257;v&#257; na t&#257;&#7745;s tarke&#7751;a yojayet</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, Bh&#299;&#7779;ma parva</span> 5.22). One should not try to understand the supreme cause by argument or reasoning. When we are beset by some problem for which we can find no reason, there is no alternative than to surrender to the Supreme Lord and offer Him our respectful obeisances. Then our position will be secure. This was the means adopted in this instance also by mother Ya&#347;od&#257;. Whatever happens, the original cause is the Supreme Personality of Godhead (<span class="Italic">sarva-k&#257;ra&#7751;a-k&#257;ra&#7751;am</span> <span class="Italic"></I>[</I>Bs. </span>5.1</I>]</I>). When the immediate cause cannot be ascertained, let us simply offer our obeisances at the lotus feet of the Lord. Mother Ya&#347;od&#257; concluded that the wonderful things she saw within the mouth of her child were due to Him, although she could not clearly ascertain the cause. Therefore when a devotee cannot ascertain the cause of suffering, he concludes:</div>

Only because of illusion do we wrongly think, &ldquo;I am existing&rdquo; or &ldquo;Everything belongs to me.&rdquo; Thus mother Ya&#347;od&#257; completely surrendered unto the Supreme Lord. For the moment, she was rather disappointed, thinking, &ldquo;My endeavors to protect my son by charity and other auspicious activities are useless.

The Absolute Truth is realized in three features (<span class="Italic">brahmeti param&#257;tmeti bhagav&#257;n iti &#347;abdyate</span>), but she is in such ecstasy that she does not care to understand what is Brahman, what is Param&#257;tm&#257; or what is Bhagav&#257;n. Bhagav&#257;n has personally descended to become her beloved child. Therefore there is no comparison to mother Ya&#347;od&#257;&rsquo;s good fortune, as declared by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu (<span class="Italic">ramy&#257; k&#257;cid up&#257;san&#257; vrajavadh&#363;-varge&#7751;a y&#257; kalpit&#257;</span>).

<div class="First">Although when the Supreme Personality of Godhead stole the butter, curd and milk of the neighboring <span class="Italic">gopas</span> and <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> this teasing superficially seemed troublesome, in fact it was an exchange of affection in the ecstasy of devotional service. The more the <span class="Italic">gopas</span> and <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> exchanged feelings with the Lord, the more their devotional service increased. Sometimes we may superficially see that a devotee is in difficulty because of being engaged in devotional service, but the fact is different. When a devotee suffers for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, that suffering is transcendental enjoyment. Unless one becomes a devotee, this cannot be understood. When K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a exhibited His childhood pastimes, not only did Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and Ya&#347;od&#257; increase their devotional affection, but those in their association also increased in devotional service. In other words, persons who follow the activities of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana will also develop devotional service in the highest perfection.</div>

Because He created this disturbance, mother Ya&#347;od&#257; decided to bind Him. These incidents are described in this chapter.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">One day, the maidservants being engaged in other work, mother Ya&#347;od&#257; was churning the yogurt into butter herself, and in the meantime K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a came and requested her to allow Him to suck her breast milk. Of course, mother Ya&#347;od&#257; immediately allowed Him to do so, but then she saw that the hot milk on the oven was boiling over, and therefore she immediately stopped allowing K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a to drink the milk of her breast and went to stop the milk on the oven from overflowing. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, however, having been interrupted in His business of sucking the breast, was very angry. He took a piece of stone, broke the churning pot and entered a room, where He began to eat the freshly churned butter. When mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, after attending to the overflowing milk, returned and saw the pot broken, she could understand that this was the work of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and therefore she went to search for Him. When she entered the room, she saw K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a standing on the <span class="Italic">ul&#363;khala,</span> a large mortar for grinding spices. Having turned the mortar upside down, He was stealing butter hanging from a swing and was distributing the butter to the monkeys. As soon as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a saw that His mother had come, He immediately began to run away, and mother Ya&#347;od&#257; began to follow Him. After going some distance, mother Ya&#347;od&#257; was able to catch K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who because of His offense was crying. Mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, of course, threatened to punish K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a if He acted that way again, and she decided to bind Him with rope. Unfortunately, when the time came to knot the rope, the rope with which she wanted to bind Him was short by a distance equal to the width of two fingers. When she made the rope longer by adding another rope, she again saw that it was short by two fingers. Again and again she tried, and again and again she found the rope too short by two fingers. Thus she became very tired, and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, seeing His affectionate mother so tired, allowed Himself to be bound. Now, being compassionate, He did not show her His unlimited potency. After mother Ya&#347;od&#257; bound K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and became engaged in other household affairs, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a observed two <span class="Italic">yamala-arjuna</span> trees, which were actually Nalak&#363;vara and Ma&#7751;igr&#299;va, two sons of Kuvera who had been condemned by N&#257;rada Muni to become trees. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, by His mercy, now began to proceed toward the trees to fulfill the desire of N&#257;rada Muni.</div>

<div class="Translation">&#346;r&#299; &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; continued: One day when mother Ya&#347;od&#257; saw that all the maidservants were engaged in other household affairs, she personally began to churn the yogurt. While churning, she remembered the childish activities of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and in her own way she composed songs and enjoyed singing to herself about all those activities.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura, quoting from the <span class="Italic">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-to&#7779;a&#7751;&#299;</span> of &#346;r&#299;la San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299;, says that the incident of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s breaking the pot of yogurt and being bound by mother Ya&#347;od&#257; took place on the Dipavali Day, or D&#299;pa-m&#257;lik&#257;. Even today in India, this festival is generally celebrated very gorgeously in the month of K&#257;rtika by fireworks and lights, especially in Bombay. It is to be understood that among all the cows of Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, several of mother Ya&#347;od&#257;&rsquo;s cows ate only grasses so flavorful that the grasses would automatically flavor the milk. Mother Ya&#347;od&#257; wanted to collect the milk from these cows, make it into yogurt and churn it into butter personally, since she thought that this child K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was going to the houses of neighborhood <span class="Italic">gopas</span> and <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> to steal butter because He did not like the milk and yogurt ordinarily prepared.</div>
<div class="Purport">While churning the butter, mother Ya&#347;od&#257; was singing about the childhood activities of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. It was formerly a custom that if one wanted to remember something constantly, he would transform it into poetry or have this done by a professional poet. It appears that mother Ya&#347;od&#257; did not want to forget K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s activities at any time. Therefore she poeticized all of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s childhood activities, such as the killing of P&#363;tan&#257;, Agh&#257;sura, &#346;aka&#7789;&#257;sura and T&#7771;&#7751;&#257;varta, and while churning the butter, she sang about these activities in poetical form. This should be the practice of persons eager to remain K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious twenty-four hours a day. This incident shows how K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious mother Ya&#347;od&#257; was. To stay in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, we should follow such persons.</div>

Sometimes one must take care of more than one item of important business for the same purpose. Therefore mother Ya&#347;od&#257; was not unjust when she left her son to take care of the overflowing milk. On the platform of love and affection, it is the duty of the devotee to do one thing first and other things later. The proper intuition by which to do this is given by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>

Great demigods like Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord &#346;iva always worship the Lord by meditation and by service. Even the most powerful Yamar&#257;ja fears K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.

Mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, of course, did not want to chastise her beloved child very much, and therefore she immediately threw her stick away and simply rebuked K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, saying, &ldquo;Now I shall bind You so that You cannot commit any further offensive activities. Nor for the time being can You play with Your playmates.&rdquo; This shows the position of a pure devotee, in contrast with others, like <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s, yog&#299;s</span> and the followers of Vedic ritualistic ceremonies, in regarding the transcendental nature of the Absolute Truth.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no beginning and no end, no exterior and no interior, no front and no rear. In other words, He is all-pervading. Because He is not under the influence of the element of time, for Him there is no difference between past, present and future; He exists in His own transcendental form at all times. Being absolute, beyond relativity, He is free from distinctions between cause and effect, although He is the cause and effect of everything. That unmanifested person, who is beyond the perception of the senses, had now appeared as a human child, and mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, considering Him her own ordinary child, bound Him to the wooden mortar with a rope.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index1ba6.html?g=3396">10.12</a>), K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is described as the Supreme Brahman (<span class="Italic">para&#7745; brahma para&#7745; dh&#257;ma</span>). The word <span class="Italic">brahma</span> means &ldquo;the greatest.&rdquo; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is greater than the greatest, being unlimited and all-pervading. How can it be possible for the all-pervading to be measured or bound? Then again, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the time factor. Therefore, He is all-pervading not only in space but also in time. We have measurements of time, but although we are limited by past, present and future, for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a these do not exist. Every individual person can be measured, but K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a has already shown that although He also is an individual, the entire cosmic manifestation is within His mouth. All these points considered, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a cannot be measured. How then did Ya&#347;od&#257; want to measure Him and bind Him? We must conclude that this took place simply on the platform of pure transcendental love. This was the only cause.</div>

<div class="First">Here is the first chapter in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s exhibition of unlimited potency to mother Ya&#347;od&#257; when she tried to bind Him: the rope was too short. The Lord had already shown His unlimited potency by killing P&#363;tan&#257;, &#346;aka&#7789;&#257;sura and T&#7771;&#7751;&#257;varta. Now K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a exhibited another <span class="Italic">vibh&#363;ti,</span> or display of potency, to mother Ya&#347;od&#257;. &ldquo;Unless I agree,&rdquo; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a desired to show, &ldquo;you cannot bind Me.&rdquo; Thus although mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, in her attempt to bind K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, added one rope after another, ultimately she was a failure. When K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a agreed, however, she was successful. In other words, one must be in transcendental love with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, but that does not mean that one can control K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.

<div class="After-Verse">By His one plenary portion as Param&#257;tm&#257;, the Lord controls innumerable universes, with all their demigods; yet He agrees to be controlled by a devotee. In the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads</span> it is said that the Supreme Personality of Godhead can run with more speed than the mind, but here we see that although K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a wanted to avoid being arrested by His mother, He was finally defeated, and mother Ya&#347;od&#257; captured Him. <span class="Italic">Lak&#7779;m&#299;-sahasra-&#347;ata-sambhrama-sevyam&#257;nam:</I> [Bs. </span></I>5.29] K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is served by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune. Nonetheless, He steals butter like one who is poverty-stricken. Yamar&#257;ja, the controller of all living entities, fears the order of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, yet K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is afraid of His mother&rsquo;s stick. These contradictions cannot be understood by one who is not a devotee, but a devotee can understand how powerful is unalloyed devotional service to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a; it is so powerful that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a can be controlled by an unalloyed devotee. This <span class="Italic">bh&#7771;tya-va&#347;yat&#257;</span> does not mean that He is under the control of the servant; rather, He is under the control of the servant&rsquo;s pure love. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index63f2.html?g=177">1.21</a>) it is said that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a became the chariot driver of Arjuna. Arjuna ordered Him, <span class="Italic">senayor ubhayor madhye ratha&#7745; sth&#257;paya me &rsquo;cyuta:</span> &ldquo;My dear K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, You have agreed to be my charioteer and to execute my orders. Place my chariot between the two armies of soldiers.&rdquo; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a immediately executed this order, and therefore one may argue that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a also is not independent. But this is one&rsquo;s <span class="Italic">aj&ntilde;&#257;na,</span> ignorance. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is always fully independent; when He becomes subordinate to His devotees, this is a display of <span class="Italic">&#257;nanda-cinmaya-rasa,</span> the humor of transcendental qualities that increases His transcendental pleasure. Everyone worships K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore He sometimes desires to be controlled by someone else. Such a controller can be no one else but a pure devotee.</div>

<div class="Translation">Neither Lord Brahm&#257;, nor Lord &#346;iva, nor even the goddess of fortune, who is always the better half of the Supreme Lord, can obtain from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the deliverer from this material world, such mercy as received by mother Ya&#347;od&#257;.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This is a comparative study between mother Ya&#347;od&#257; and other devotees of the Lord. As stated in <span class="Italic">Caitanya carit&#257;m&#7771;ta</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">&#256;di</span> <a href="indexff49.html?g=85535">5.142</a>), <span class="Italic">ekale &#299;&#347;vara k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, &#257;ra saba bh&#7771;tya:</span> the only supreme master is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and all others are His servants. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a has the transcendental quality of <span class="Italic">bh&#7771;tya-va&#347;yat&#257;,</span> becoming subordinate to His <span class="Italic">bh&#7771;tya,</span> or servant. Now, although everyone is <span class="Italic">bh&#7771;tya</span> and although K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a has the quality of becoming subordinate to His <span class="Italic">bh&#7771;tya,</span> the position of mother Ya&#347;od&#257; is the greatest. Lord Brahm&#257; is <span class="Italic">bh&#7771;tya,</span> a servant of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and he is <span class="Italic">&#257;di-kavi,</span> the original creator of this universe (<span class="Italic">tene brahma h&#7771;d&#257; ya &#257;di-kavaye</span>). Nonetheless, even he could not obtain such mercy as mother Ya&#347;od&#257;. As for Lord &#346;iva, he is the topmost Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava (<span class="Italic">vai&#7779;&#7751;av&#257;n&#257;&#7745; yath&#257; &#347;ambhu&#7717;</span>). What to speak of Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord &#346;iva, the goddess of fortune, Lak&#7779;m&#299;, is the Lord&rsquo;s constant companion in service, since she always associates with His body. But even she could not get such mercy. Therefore Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was surprised, thinking, &ldquo;What did mother Ya&#347;od&#257; and Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja do in their previous lives by which they got such a great opportunity, the opportunity to be the affectionate father and mother of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a?&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">In this verse there are three negative pronouncements&mdash;<span class="Italic">na, na, na.</span> When anything is uttered three times&mdash;&ldquo;do it, do it, do it&rdquo;&mdash;one should understand that this is meant to indicate great stress on a fact. In this verse, we find <span class="Italic">na lebhire, na lebhire, na lebhire.</span> Yet mother Ya&#347;od&#257; is in the supermost exalted position, and thus K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a has become completely subordinate to her.</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">vimuktid&#257;t</span> is also significant. There are different types of liberation, such as <span class="Italic">s&#257;yujya, s&#257;lokya, s&#257;r&#363;pya, s&#257;r&#7779;&#7789;i</span> and <span class="Italic">s&#257;m&#299;pya,</span> but <span class="Italic">vimukti</span> means &ldquo;special <span class="Italic">mukti.</span>&rdquo; When after liberation one is situated on the platform of <span class="Italic">prema-bhakti,</span> one is said to have achieved <span class="Italic">vimukti,</span> &ldquo;special <span class="Italic">mukti.</span>&rdquo; Therefore the word <span class="Italic">na</span> is mentioned. That exalted platform of <span class="Italic">prem&#257;</span> is described by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu as <span class="Italic">prem&#257; pum-artho mah&#257;n,</span> and mother Ya&#347;od&#257; naturally acts in such an exalted position in loving affairs. She is therefore a <span class="Italic">nitya-siddha</span> devotee, an expansion of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s <span class="Italic">hl&#257;din&#299;</span> potency, His potency to enjoy transcendental bliss through expansions who are special devotees (<span class="Italic">&#257;nanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibh&#257;vit&#257;bhi&#7717;</span>). Such devotees are not <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhana-siddha.</span></div>

Everyone loves his body and wants to protect it because he is within the body as the soul, and everyone loves the soul because the soul is part and parcel of the Supersoul. Therefore, everyone is actually seeking to achieve happiness by reviving his relationship with the Supersoul. As the Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a>), <span class="Italic">vedai&#347; ca sarvair aham eva vedya&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;By all the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> it is I who am to be known.&rdquo; Therefore, the <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s, j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s, yog&#299;s</span> and saintly persons are all seeking K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. But by following in the footsteps of devotees who are in a direct relationship with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, especially the inhabitants of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, one can reach the supreme position of associating with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. As it is said, <span class="Italic">v&#7771;nd&#257;vana&#7745; parityajya padam eka&#7745; na gacchati:</span> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a does not leave V&#7771;nd&#257;vana even for a moment. The <span class="Italic">v&#7771;nd&#257;vana-v&#257;s&#299;s</span>&mdash;mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s friends and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s conjugal lovers, the younger <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> with whom He dances&mdash;have very intimate relationships with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and if one follows in the footsteps of these devotees, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is available. Although the <span class="Italic">nitya-siddha</span> expansions of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a always remain with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, if those engaged in <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhana-siddhi</span> follow in the footsteps of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s <span class="Italic">nitya-siddha</span> associates, such <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhana-siddhas</span> also can easily attain K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a without difficulty. But there are those who are attached to bodily concepts of life. Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord &#346;iva, for example, have very prestigious positions, and thus they have the sense of being very exalted <span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;varas.</span> In other words, because Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord &#346;iva are <span class="Italic">gu&#7751;a-avat&#257;ras</span> and have exalted positions, they have some small sense of being like K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. But the pure devotees who inhabit V&#7771;nd&#257;vana do not possess any bodily conception. They are fully dedicated to the service of the Lord in sublime affection, <span class="Italic">prem&#257;.</span> &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu has therefore recommended, <span class="Italic">prem&#257; pum-artho mah&#257;n:</span> the highest perfection of life is <span class="Italic">prem&#257;,</span> pure love in relationship with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.

</div><A NAME="125989"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Nalak&#363;vara and Ma&#7751;igr&#299;va were great devotees of Lord &#346;iva, but because of material opulence they became so extravagant and senseless that one day they were enjoying with naked girls in a lake and shamelessly walking here and there. Suddenly N&#257;rada Muni passed by, but they were so maddened by their wealth and false prestige that even though they saw N&#257;rada Muni present, they remained naked and were not even ashamed. In other words, because of opulence and false prestige, they lost their sense of common decency. Of course, it is the nature of the material qualities that when one becomes very much opulent in terms of wealth and a prestigious position, one loses one&rsquo;s sense of etiquette and does not care about anyone, even a sage like N&#257;rada Muni. For such bewildered persons (<span class="Italic">aha&#7749;k&#257;ra-vim&#363;&#7693;h&#257;tm&#257;</span>), who especially deride devotees, the proper punishment is to be again stricken with poverty. The Vedic rules and regulations prescribe how to control the false sense of prestige by the practice of <span class="Italic">yama, niyama</span> and so on (<span class="Italic">tapas&#257; brahmacarye&#7751;a &#347;amena ca damena ca</I> [SB </span></I><a href="index22f6.html?g=46626">6.1.13</a>]). A poor man can be convinced very easily that the prestige of an opulent position in this material world is temporary, but a rich man cannot. Therefore N&#257;rada Muni set an example by cursing these two persons, Nalak&#363;vara and Ma&#7751;igr&#299;va, to become dull and unconscious like trees. This was a fit punishment. But because K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is always merciful, even though they were punished they were fortunate enough to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. Therefore the punishment given by Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas is not at all punishment; rather, it is another kind of mercy. By the curse of the <span class="Italic">devar&#7779;i,</span> Nalak&#363;vara and Ma&#7751;igr&#299;va became twin <span class="Italic">arjuna</span> trees and remained in the courtyard of mother Ya&#347;od&#257; and Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, waiting for the opportunity to see K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a directly. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, by the desire of His devotee, uprooted these <span class="Italic">yamala-arjuna</span> trees, and when Nalak&#363;vara and Ma&#7751;igr&#299;va were thus delivered by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a after one hundred years of the <span class="Italic">devas,</span> their old consciousness revived, and they offered K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a prayers suitable to be offered by demigods. Having thus gotten the opportunity to see K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a face to face, they understood how merciful N&#257;rada Muni was, and therefore they expressed their indebtedness to him and thanked him. Then, after circumambulating the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, they departed for their respective abodes.</div>

<div class="Translation">&#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; said: O King Par&#299;k&#7779;it, because the two sons of Kuvera had been elevated to the association of Lord &#346;iva, of which they were very much proud, they were allowed to wander in a garden attached to Kail&#257;sa Hill, on the bank of the Mand&#257;kin&#299; River. Taking advantage of this, they used to drink a kind of liquor called V&#257;ru&#7751;&#299;. Accompanied by women singing after them, they would wander in that garden of flowers, their eyes always rolling in intoxication.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">This verse mentions some of the material advantages afforded to persons associated with or devoted to Lord &#346;iva. Apart from Lord &#346;iva, if one is a devotee of any other demigod, one receives some material advantages. Foolish people, therefore, become devotees of demigods. This has been pointed out and criticized by Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexda67.html?g=2640">7.20</a>): <span class="Italic">k&#257;mais tais tair h&#7771;ta j&ntilde;&#257;n&#257;&#7717; prapadyante &rsquo;nya-devat&#257;&#7717;.</span> Those who are not devotees of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a have a taste for women, wine and so forth, and therefore they have been described as <span class="Italic">h&#7771;ta j&ntilde;&#257;na,</span> bereft of sense.

We can actually see, especially in this age, that those who have unnecessary riches simply try to enjoy these three things. In Western civilization, these three things are very prominent because of an unnecessary increase of wealth. N&#257;rada Muni considered all this in the case of Ma&#7751;igr&#299;va and Nalak&#363;vara because he found in them so much pride in the wealth of their father, Kuvera.</div>

That supreme controller is observing every bit of one&rsquo;s activity, and He rewards or punishes everyone by giving one a suitable body made by material nature (<span class="Italic">bhr&#257;mayan sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;ni yantr&#257;r&#363;&#7693;h&#257;ni m&#257;yay&#257;</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index0d72.html?g=5952">18.61</a></I><span class="Italic">]</I></span>). In this way, sinful persons automatically receive punishment in different types of bodies. The root cause of this punishment is that when one unnecessarily accumulates wealth, one becomes more and more degraded, not knowing that his wealth will be finished with his next birth.</div>

Human life is not meant for making the senses unnecessarily strong so that one suffers from disease and one increases in an envious, fighting spirit.

In this way, the whole civilization is being spoiled.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is so kind that if anyone offers Him a leaf, a fruit, a flower or some water, He will immediately accept it. The only condition is that these things should be offered with <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> (<span class="Italic">yo me bhakty&#257; prayacchati</span>). Otherwise, if one is puffed up with false prestige, thinking, &ldquo;I have so much opulence, and I am giving something to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a,&rdquo; one&rsquo;s offering will not be accepted by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The fruit vendor, although a woman belonging to the poor aborigine class, dealt with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a with great affection, saying, &ldquo;K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, You have come to me to take some fruit in exchange for grains. All the grains have fallen, but still You may take whatever You like.&rdquo; Thus she filled K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s palms with whatever fruits He could carry.

The basic principle involved is an exchange of love.

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;O son of Kunt&#299;, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and give away, as well as all austerities that you may perform, should be done as an offering unto Me.&rdquo; With love and affection, one should try to give something to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a from one&rsquo;s source of income. Then one&rsquo;s life will be successful. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is full in all opulences; He does not need anything from anyone. But if one is prepared to give something to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, that is for one&rsquo;s own benefit. The example given in this connection is that when one&rsquo;s real face is decorated, the reflection of one&rsquo;s face is automatically decorated.

Now let us leave this place and go someplace where we may worship Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u undisturbed, before there is another cause of death from some demon who may attack us.&rdquo; A devotee desires only that he may execute devotional service undisturbed. Actually we see, however, that even during the presence of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, when Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and the other cowherd men had the Supreme Personality of Godhead in their presence, there were disturbances. Of course, in every case, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a came out victorious. The instruction we may derive from this is that we should not be disturbed by so-called disturbances. There have been so many disturbances to our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, but we cannot give up our forward march. On the contrary, people are receiving this movement very enthusiastically all over the world, and they are purchasing literature about K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness with redoubled energy. Thus there are both encouragements and disturbances. This was so even in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s time.</div>

Although K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a Himself, Gargamuni did not disclose this. Thus Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja appreciated the words of Gargamuni, but because of his deep affection he could not understand who K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was, although Gargamuni had said that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s qualities would be exactly like those of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This chapter describes in detail K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s pastime of killing Agh&#257;sura.</div>
</div><A NAME="127286"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">One day K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a wanted to enjoy a picnic lunch within the forest, and therefore He went out early into the forest with the other cowherd boys, accompanied by their respective groups of calves. While they were enjoying their picnic, Agh&#257;sura, the younger brother of P&#363;tan&#257; and Bak&#257;sura, appeared there, desiring to kill K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and His companions. The demon, who had been sent by Ka&#7745;sa, assumed the form of a python, expanding himself to a length of eight miles and the height of a mountain, his mouth seeming to extend from the surface of the earth to the heavenly planets. Having assumed this feature, Agh&#257;sura lay on the road. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s friends, the cowherd boys, thought that the demon&rsquo;s form was one of the beautiful spots of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana. Thus they wanted to enter within the mouth of this gigantic python. The gigantic figure of the python became a subject for their sporting pleasure, and they began to laugh, confident that even if this figure were dangerous, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was there to protect them. In this way, they proceeded toward the mouth of the gigantic figure.</div>
</div><A NAME="127287"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a knew everything about Agh&#257;sura, and therefore He wanted to forbid His friends to enter the demon&rsquo;s mouth, but in the meantime all the cowherd boys, along with their groups of calves, entered the mouth of that gigantic figure. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was waiting outside, and Agh&#257;sura was waiting for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, thinking that as soon as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a entered he would close his mouth so that everyone would die. While waiting for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, he refrained from swallowing the boys. In the meantime, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was thinking of how to save the boys and kill Agh&#257;sura. Thus He entered the mouth of the gigantic <span class="Italic">asura,</span> and when He was within the demon&rsquo;s mouth along with His friends, He expanded His body to such an extent that the <span class="Italic">asura</span> suffocated and died. After this, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, by casting His nectarean glance upon His friends, brought them back to life, and with pleasure they all came out unhurt. Thus K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a encouraged all the demigods, and they expressed their pleasure and happiness. For a crooked, sinful person there is no scope for <span class="Italic">s&#257;yujya-mukti,</span> or becoming one with the effulgence of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, but because the Supreme Personality of Godhead entered the body of Agh&#257;sura, by His touch this demon got the opportunity to merge into the existence of the Brahman effulgence and thus attain <span class="Italic">s&#257;yujya-mukti.</span></div>
</div><A NAME="127288"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">When this pastime was performed, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was only five years old. One year later, when He was six years old and He stepped into the <span class="Italic">pauga&#7751;&#7693;a</span> age, this pastime was disclosed to the inhabitants of Vraja. Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja inquired, &ldquo;Why is it that this pastime was disclosed only after one year and yet the inhabitants of Vraja thought that it had been performed that very day?&rdquo; With this question, the Twelfth Chapter ends.</div>

<div class="Translation">All the boys would be differently engaged. Some boys blew their flutes, and others blew bugles made of horn. Some imitated the buzzing of the bumblebees, and others imitated the voice of the cuckoo. Some boys imitated flying birds by running after the birds&rsquo; shadows on the ground, some imitated the beautiful movements and attractive postures of the swans, some sat down with the ducks, sitting silently, and others imitated the dancing of the peacocks. Some boys attracted young monkeys in the trees, some jumped into the trees, imitating the monkeys, some made faces as the monkeys were accustomed to do, and others jumped from one branch to another. Some boys went to the waterfalls and crossed over the river, jumping with the frogs, and when they saw their own reflections on the water they would laugh. They would also condemn the sounds of their own echoes. In this way, all the cowherd boys used to play with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who is the source of the Brahman effulgence for j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s desiring to merge into that effulgence, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead for devotees who have accepted eternal servitorship, and who for ordinary persons is but another ordinary child. The cowherd boys, having accumulated the results of pious activities for many lives, were able to associate in this way with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. How can one explain their great fortune?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">As recommended by &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299;, <span class="Italic">tasm&#257;t ken&#257;py up&#257;yena mana&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;e nive&#347;ayet</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bhakti-ras&#257;m&#7771;ta-sindhu</span> 1.2.4). Somehow or other, whether one thinks of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as an ordinary human child, as the source of the Brahman effulgence, as the origin of Param&#257;tm&#257;, or as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one should concentrate one&rsquo;s full attention upon the lotus feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. That is also the instruction of <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index3a32.html?g=5997">18.66</a>): <span class="Italic">sarva-dharm&#257;n parityajya m&#257;m eka&#7745; &#347;ara&#7751;a&#7745; vraja.</span> <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the easiest way of directly approaching K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. <span class="Italic">&#298;&#347;vara&#7717; sadyo h&#7771;dy avarudhyate &rsquo;tra k&#7771;tibhi&#7717; &#347;u&#347;r&#363;&#7779;ubhis tat-k&#7779;a&#7751;&#257;t</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="index713b.html?g=6130">1.1.2</a>). Diverting even a little of one&rsquo;s attention toward K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and activities in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness immediately enables one to achieve the highest perfection of life.

Therefore every day a demon would come and interrupt their sporting pastimes. The demon would be killed, and then the boys would engage again in their transcendental pastimes.</div>

<div class="Translation">From the body of the gigantic python, a glaring effulgence came out, illuminating all directions, and stayed individually in the sky until K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a came out from the corpse&rsquo;s mouth. Then, as all the demigods looked on, this effulgence entered into K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s body.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Apparently the serpent named Agh&#257;sura, because of having received association with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, attained <span class="Italic">mukti</span> by entering K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s body. Entering the body of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is called <span class="Italic">s&#257;yujya-mukti,</span> but later verses prove that Agh&#257;sura, like Dantavakra and others, received <span class="Italic">s&#257;r&#363;pya-mukti.</span> This has been broadly described by &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura with references from the <span class="Italic">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-to&#7779;a&#7751;&#299;</span> of &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;.

The explanation of how this is so may be summarized as follows.</div>
<div class="Purport">The effulgence came out from the python&rsquo;s body and became purified, attaining spiritual <span class="Italic">&#347;uddha-sattva,</span> freedom from material contamination, because K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a had stayed within the serpent&rsquo;s body, even after the serpent&rsquo;s death.

But K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is so kind that in order to drive away such doubts, He had the effulgence, the individual life of the python, wait for some time in its individuality, in the presence of all the demigods.</div>
<div class="Purport">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the full effulgence, and every living being is part and parcel of that effulgence. As proved here, the effulgence in every living being is individual. For some time, the effulgence remained outside the demon&rsquo;s body, individually, and did not mix with the whole effulgence, the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti.</span> The Brahman effulgence is not visible to material eyes, but to prove that every living being is individual, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a had this individual effulgence stay outside the demon&rsquo;s body for some time, for everyone to see. Then K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a proved that anyone killed by Him attains liberation, whether <span class="Italic">s&#257;yujya, s&#257;r&#363;pya, s&#257;m&#299;pya</span> or whatever.</div>
<div class="Purport">But the liberation of those who are on the transcendental platform of love and affection is <span class="Italic">vimukti,</span> special liberation. Thus the serpent first entered the body of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a personally and mixed with the Brahman effulgence. This merging is called <span class="Italic">s&#257;yujya-mukti.</span> But from later verses we find that Agh&#257;sura attained <span class="Italic">s&#257;r&#363;pya-mukti.</span> Text 38 explains that Agh&#257;sura attained a body exactly like that of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and the verse after that also clearly states that he attained a completely spiritual body like that of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. Therefore in two or three places the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> has confirmed that Agh&#257;sura attained <span class="Italic">s&#257;r&#363;pya-mukti.</span> One may then argue, How is it that he mixed with the Brahman effulgence? The answer is that as Jaya and Vijaya, after three births, again attained <span class="Italic">s&#257;r&#363;pya-mukti</span> and association with the Lord, Agh&#257;sura received a similar liberation.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The process for receiving the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is described here. <span class="Italic">Yat-p&#257;da-pa&#7749;kaja-pal&#257;&#347;a-vil&#257;sa-bhakty&#257;</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="index8af3.html?g=37627">4.22.39</a>). Simply by thinking of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, one can attain Him very easily. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is also described as having His lotus feet always within the hearts of His devotees (<span class="Italic">bhagav&#257;n bhakta-h&#7771;di sthita&#7717;</span>). In the case of Agh&#257;sura, one may argue that he was not a devotee.

Although Agh&#257;sura&rsquo;s purpose was to kill K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, for a moment Agh&#257;sura thought of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a with devotion, and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and His associates wanted to sport within Agh&#257;sura&rsquo;s mouth. Similarly, P&#363;tan&#257; wanted to kill K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a by poisoning Him, but K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a took her as His mother because He had accepted the milk of her breast. <span class="Italic">Svalpam apy asya dharmasya tr&#257;yate mahato bhay&#257;t</span> (Bg. <a href="index5584.html?g=745">2.40</a>).

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This chapter describes Lord Brahm&#257;&rsquo;s attempt to take away the calves and cowherd boys, and it also describes the bewilderment of Lord Brahm&#257; and finally the clearance of his illusion.</div>
</div><A NAME="127803"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Although the incident concerning Agh&#257;sura had been performed one year before, when the cowherd boys were five years old, when they were six years old they said, &ldquo;It happened today.&rdquo; What happened was this. After killing Agh&#257;sura, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, along with His associates the cowherd boys, went for a picnic within the forest. The calves, being allured by green grasses, gradually went far away, and therefore K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s associates became a little agitated and wanted to bring back the calves. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, however, encouraged the boys by saying, &ldquo;You take your <span class="Italic">tiffin</span> without being agitated. I shall go find the calves.&rdquo; And thus the Lord departed. Then, just to examine the potency of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Lord Brahm&#257; took away all the calves and cowherd boys and kept them in a secluded place.</div>
</div><A NAME="127804"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">When K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was unable to find the calves and boys, He could understand that this was a trick performed by Brahm&#257;. Then the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, in order to please Lord Brahm&#257;, as well as His own associates and their mothers, expanded Himself to become the calves and boys, exactly as they were before. In this way, He discovered another pastime. A special feature of this pastime was that the mothers of the cowherd boys thus became more attached to their respective sons, and the cows became more attached to their calves. After nearly a year, Baladeva observed that all the cowherd boys and calves were expansions of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Thus He inquired from K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and was informed of what had happened.</div>
</div><A NAME="127805"></A>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">When one full year had passed, Brahm&#257; returned and saw that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was still engaged as usual with His friends and the calves and cows. Then K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a exhibited all the calves and cowherd boys as four-armed forms of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. Brahm&#257; could then understand K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s potency, and he was astonished by the pastimes of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, his worshipable Lord. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, however, bestowed His causeless mercy upon Brahm&#257; and released him from illusion. Thus Brahm&#257; began to offer prayers to glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation">Paramaha&#7745;sas, devotees who have accepted the essence of life, are attached to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in the core of their hearts, and He is the aim of their lives. It is their nature to talk only of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a at every moment, as if such topics were newer and newer. They are attached to such topics, just as materialists are attached to topics of women and sex.</div>

<div class="First">The word <span class="Italic">s&#257;ra-bh&#7771;t&#257;m</span> means <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sas.</span> The <span class="Italic">ha&#7745;sa,</span> or swan, accepts milk from a mixture of milk and water and rejects the water. Similarly, the nature of persons who have taken to spiritual life and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, understanding K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a to be the life and soul of everyone, is that they cannot give up <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-kath&#257;,</span> or topics about K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, at any moment.

In this way, the life of a <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa</span> devotee is used entirely for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, just as the life of a person attached to the material world is used simply for women and money.

<div class="Translation">Because of an increase of affection, the cows had constant attachment even to those calves that were grown up and had stopped sucking milk from their mothers. When Baladeva saw this attachment, He was unable to understand the reason for it, and thus He began to consider as follows.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The cows had younger calves who had started sucking milk from their mothers, and some of the cows had newly given birth, but now, because of love, the cows enthusiastically showed their affection for the older calves, which had left off milking. These calves were grown up, but still the mothers wanted to feed them. Therefore Balar&#257;ma was a little surprised, and He wanted to inquire from K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a about the reason for their behavior. The mothers were actually more anxious to feed the older calves, although the new calves were present, because the older calves were expansions of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. These surprising events were taking place by the manipulation of <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;.</span> There are two <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;s</span> working under the direction of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&mdash;<span class="Italic">mah&#257;m&#257;y&#257;,</span> the energy of the material world, and <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;,</span> the energy of the spiritual world. These uncommon events were taking place because of the influence of <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;.</span> From the very day on which Brahm&#257; stole the calves and boys, <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;</span> acted in such a way that the residents of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, including even Lord Balar&#257;ma, could not understand how <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;</span> was working and causing such uncommon things to happen. But as <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;</span> gradually acted, Balar&#257;ma in particular was able to understand what was happening, and therefore He inquired from K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>

He thought, &ldquo;It was arranged by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and even I could not check its mystic power.&rdquo; Thus Balar&#257;ma understood that all these boys and calves were only expansions of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>

Now I can see that You alone are manifesting Yourself in all varieties of difference. Although one, You are existing in the different forms of the calves and boys. Please briefly explain this to Me.&rdquo; Having thus been requested by Lord Baladeva, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a explained the whole situation, and Baladeva understood it.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Inquiring from K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a about the actual situation, Lord Balar&#257;ma said, &ldquo;My dear K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, in the beginning I thought that all these cows, calves and cowherd boys were either great sages and saintly persons or demigods, but at the present it appears that they are actually Your expansions. They are all You; You Yourself are playing as the calves and cows and boys. What is the mystery of this situation? Where have those other calves and cows and boys gone? And why are You expanding Yourself as the cows, calves and boys? Will You kindly tell Me what is the cause?&rdquo; At the request of Balar&#257;ma, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a briefly explained the whole situation: how the calves and boys were stolen by Brahm&#257; and how He was concealing the incident by expanding Himself so that people would not know that the original cows, calves and boys were missing. Balar&#257;ma understood, therefore, that this was not <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> but K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s opulence. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a has all opulences, and this was but another opulence of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>
<div class="Purport">&ldquo;At first,&rdquo; Lord Balar&#257;ma said, &ldquo;I thought that these boys and calves were a display of the power of great sages like N&#257;rada, but now I see that all these boys and calves are You.&rdquo; After inquiring from K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Lord Balar&#257;ma understood that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself had become many. That the Lord can do this is stated in the <span class="Ref_Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> (5.33). <span class="Italic">Advaitam acyutam an&#257;dim ananta-r&#363;pam:</span> although He is one, He can expand Himself in so many forms. According to the Vedic version, <span class="Italic">eka&#7745; bahu sy&#257;m:</span> He can expand Himself into many thousands and millions but still remain one. In that sense, everything is spiritual because everything is an expansion of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a; that is, everything is an expansion either of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself or of His potency. Because the potency is nondifferent from the potent, the potency and the potent are one (<span class="Italic">&#347;akti-&#347;aktimatayor abheda&#7717;</span>). The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s, however, say, <span class="Italic">cid-acit-samanvaya&#7717;:</span> spirit and matter are one. This is a wrong conception. Spirit (<span class="Italic">cit</span>) is different from matter (<span class="Italic">acit</span>), as explained by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index7379.html?g=2496">7.4</a>&ndash;5):</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego&mdash;all together these eight comprise My separated material energies. But besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine, which consists of all living entities who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe.&rdquo; Spirit and matter cannot be made one, for actually they are superior and inferior energies, yet the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s, or Advaita-v&#257;d&#299;s, try to make them one. This is wrong. Although spirit and matter ultimately come from the same one source, they cannot be made one. For example, there are many things that come from our bodies, but although they come from the same source, they cannot be made one. We should be careful to note that although the supreme source is one, the emanations from this source should be separately regarded as inferior and superior. The difference between the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da and Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava philosophies is that the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava philosophy recognizes this fact. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu&rsquo;s philosophy, therefore, is called <span class="Italic">acintya-bhed&#257;bheda</span>&mdash;simultaneous oneness and difference. For example, fire and heat cannot be separated, for where there is fire there is heat and where there is heat there is fire. Nonetheless, although we cannot touch fire, heat we can tolerate. Therefore, although they are one, they are different.</div>

<div class="Translation">When Lord Brahm&#257; returned after a moment of time had passed (according to his own measurement), he saw that although by human measurement a complete year had passed, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, after all that time, was engaged just as before in playing with the boys and calves, who were His expansions.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Lord Brahm&#257; had gone away for only a moment of his time, but when he returned, a year of human time had passed. On different planets, the calculation of time is different. To give an example, a man-made satellite may orbit the earth in an hour and twenty-five minutes and thus complete one full day, although a day ordinarily takes twenty-four hours for those living on earth. Therefore, what was but a moment for Brahm&#257; was one year on earth. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a continued to expand Himself in so many forms for one year, but by the arrangement of <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;</span> no one could understand this but Balar&#257;ma.</div>
<div class="Purport">After one moment of Brahm&#257;&rsquo;s calculation, Brahm&#257; came back to see the fun caused by his stealing the boys and calves. But he was also afraid that he was playing with fire. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was his master, and he had played mischief for fun by taking away K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s calves and boys. He was really anxious, so he did not stay away very long; he came back after a moment (of his calculation). When Brahm&#257; returned, he saw that all the boys, calves and cows were playing with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in the same way as when he had come upon them; by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s display of <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;,</span> the same pastimes were going on without any change.</div>
<div class="Purport">On the day when Lord Brahm&#257; had first come, Baladeva could not go with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and the cowherd boys, for it was His birthday, and His mother had kept Him back for the proper ceremonial bath, called <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;ntika-sn&#257;na.</span> Therefore Lord Baladeva was not taken by Brahm&#257; at that time. Now, one year later, Brahm&#257; returned, and because he returned on exactly the same day, Baladeva was again kept at home for His birthday. Therefore, although this verse mentions that Brahm&#257; saw K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and all the cowherd boys, Baladeva is not mentioned. It was five or six days earlier that Baladeva had inquired from K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a about the extraordinary affection of the cows and cowherd men, but now, when Brahm&#257; returned, Brahm&#257; saw all the calves and cowherd boys playing with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as expansions of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, but he did not see Baladeva. As in the previous year, Lord Baladeva did not go to the woods on the day Lord Brahm&#257; appeared there.</div>

<div class="First">For one year Lord Brahm&#257; kept the calves and boys lying down in a cave by his mystic power. Therefore when Brahm&#257; saw Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a still playing with all the cows and calves, he began trying to reason about what was happening. &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Maybe I took those calves and cowherd boys away but now they have been taken from that cave. Is this what has happened? Has K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a brought them back here?&rdquo; Then, however, Lord Brahm&#257; saw that the calves and boys he had taken were still in the same mystic <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> into which he had put them. Thus he concluded that the calves and cowherd boys now playing with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a were different from the ones in the cave. He could understand that although the original calves and boys were still in the cave where he had put them, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a had expanded Himself and so the present demonstration of calves and boys consisted of expansions of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. They had the same features, the same mentality and the same intentions, but they were all K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>

<div class="Translation">Thus because Lord Brahm&#257; wanted to mystify the all-pervading Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who can never be mystified, but who, on the contrary, mystifies the entire universe, he himself was put into bewilderment by his own mystic power.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Brahm&#257; wanted to bewilder K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who bewilders the entire universe. The whole universe is under K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s mystic power (<span class="Italic">mama m&#257;y&#257; duratyay&#257;</span>), but Brahm&#257; wanted to mystify Him. The result was that Brahm&#257; himself was mystified, just as one who wants to kill another may himself be killed. In other words, Brahm&#257; was defeated by his own attempt. In a similar position are the scientists and philosophers who want to overcome the mystic power of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. They challenge K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, saying, &ldquo;What is God? We can do this, and we can do that.&rdquo; But the more they challenge K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in this way, the more they are implicated in suffering. The lesson here is that we should not try to overcome K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Rather, instead of endeavoring to surpass Him, we should surrender to Him (<span class="Italic">sarva-dharm&#257;n parityajya m&#257;m eka&#7745; &#347;ara&#7751;a&#7745; vraja</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="index3a32.html?g=5997">18.66</a>]).</div>
<div class="Purport">Instead of defeating K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Brahm&#257; himself was defeated, for he could not understand what K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was doing. Since Brahm&#257;, the chief person within this universe, was so bewildered, what is to be said of so-called scientists and philosophers? <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharm&#257;n parityajya m&#257;m eka&#7745; &#347;ara&#7751;a&#7745; vraja</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="index3a32.html?g=5997">18.66</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> We should give up all our tiny efforts to defy the arrangement of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Instead, whatever arrangements He proposes, we should accept. This is always better, for this will make us happy. The more we try to defeat the arrangement of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the more we become implicated in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">daiv&#299; hy e&#7779;&#257; gu&#7751;a-may&#299; mama m&#257;y&#257; duratyay&#257;</span>). But one who has reached the point of surrendering to the instructions of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (<span class="Italic">m&#257;m eva ye prapadyante</span>) is liberated, free from <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-m&#257;y&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;m et&#257;&#7745; taranti te</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexd990.html?g=2586">7.14</a>]). The power of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is just like a government that cannot be overcome. First of all there are laws, and then there is police power, and beyond that is military power. Therefore, what is the use of trying to overcome the power of the government? Similarly, what is the use of trying to challenge K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a?</div>
<div class="Purport">From the next verse it is clear that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a cannot be defeated by any kind of mystic power. If one gets even a little power of scientific knowledge, one tries to defy God, but actually no one is able to bewilder K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. When Brahm&#257;, the chief person within the universe, tried to bewilder K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, he himself was bewildered and astonished. This is the position of the conditioned soul. Brahm&#257; wanted to mystify K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, but he himself was mystified.</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;um</span> is significant in this verse. Vi&#7779;&#7751;u pervades the entire material world, whereas Brahm&#257; merely occupies one subordinate post.</div>

The four-headed Brahm&#257; of this universe then saw innumerable other Brahm&#257;s coming to see K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and offer their respects. Some of them had ten heads, some had twenty, some had a hundred and some had a million heads. Upon seeing this wonderful exhibition, the four-headed Brahm&#257; became nervous and began to think of himself as no more than a mosquito in the midst of many elephants. Therefore, what can Brahm&#257; do to bewilder K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a?</div>

<div class="First">When one wants to supersede a superior power, one&rsquo;s own inferior power becomes ludicrous.

On a dark night, the darkness produced by snow has no meaning. The glowworm appears very important at night, but in the daytime its glow has no value; whatever little value it has is lost. Similarly, Brahm&#257; became insignificant in the presence of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s mystic power.

All the opulences of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u are already present in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and consequently for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a to demonstrate so many Vi&#7779;&#7751;u forms was actually not very astonishing.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Those Vi&#7779;&#7751;u forms blessed the devotees with Their clear glances and smiles, which resembled the increasingly full light of the moon (<span class="Italic">&#347;reya&#7717;-kairava-candrik&#257;-vitara&#7751;am</span>). As maintainers, They glanced upon Their devotees, embracing them and protecting them by smiling. Their smiles resembled the mode of goodness, protecting all the desires of the devotees, and the glancing of Their eyes resembled the mode of passion. Actually, in this verse the word <span class="Italic">raja&#7717;</span> means not &ldquo;passion&rdquo; but &ldquo;affection.&rdquo; In the material world, <span class="Italic">rajo-gu&#7751;a</span> is passion, but in the spiritual world it is affection. In the material world, affection is contaminated by <span class="Italic">rajo-gu&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">tamo-gu&#7751;a,</span> but in the <span class="Italic">&#347;uddha-sattva</span> the affection that maintains the devotees is transcendental.</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">svak&#257;rth&#257;n&#257;m</span> refers to great desires. As mentioned in this verse, the glance of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u creates the desires of the devotees. A pure devotee, however, has no desires. Therefore San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299; comments that because the desires of devotees whose attention is fixed on K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a have already been fulfilled, the Lord&rsquo;s sidelong glances create variegated desires in relation to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and devotional service. In the material world, desire is a product of <span class="Italic">rajo-gu&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">tamo-gu&#7751;a,</span> hilt desire in the spiritual world gives rise to a variety of everlasting transcendental service. Thus the word <span class="Italic">svak&#257;rth&#257;n&#257;m</span> refers to eagerness to serve K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>
<div class="Purport">In V&#7771;nd&#257;vana there is a place where there was no temple, but a devotee desired, &ldquo;Let there be a temple and <span class="Italic">sev&#257;,</span> devotional service.&rdquo; Therefore, what was once an empty corner has now become a place of pilgrimage. Such are the desires of a devotee.</div>

<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma,</span> therefore, is essential, for it can bring people to <span class="Italic">sattva-gu&#7751;a.</span> <span class="Italic">Tad&#257; rajas-tamo-bh&#257;v&#257;&#7717; k&#257;ma-lobh&#257;daya&#347; ca ye</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="index517e.html?g=6496">1.2.19</a>). <span class="Italic">Tamo-gu&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">rajo-gu&#7751;a</span> increase lust and greed, which implicate a living entity in such a way that he must exist in this material world in many, many forms.

<div class="After-Verse">The opportunity for this purification is the special feature of human life; in other lives, this is not possible. Such purification can be achieved very easily by <span class="Italic">r&#257;dh&#257;-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-bhajana,</span> devotional service rendered to R&#257;dh&#257; and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and therefore Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura sings, <span class="Italic">hari hari viphale janama go&#7749;&#257;inu,</span> indicating that unless one worships R&#257;dh&#257;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, one&rsquo;s human form of life is wasted. <span class="Italic">V&#257;sudeve bhagavati bhakti-yoga&#7717; prayojita&#7717;/ janayaty &#257;&#347;u vair&#257;gyam</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="indexbe51.html?g=6388">1.2.7</a>). By engagement in the service of V&#257;sudeva, one very quickly renounces material life. The members of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, for example, being engaged in <span class="Italic">v&#257;sudeva-bhakti,</span> very quickly come to the stage of being nice Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas, so much so that people are surprised that <span class="Italic">mlecchas</span> and <span class="Italic">yavanas</span> are able to come to this stage. This is possible by <span class="Italic">v&#257;sudeva-bhakti.</span> But if we do not come to the stage of <span class="Italic">sattva-gu&#7751;a</span> in this human life, then, as Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura sings, <span class="Italic">hari hari viphale janama go&#7749;&#257;inu</span>&mdash;there is no profit in gaining this human form of life.</div>
<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299; V&#299;rar&#257;ghava &#256;c&#257;rya comments that each of the items mentioned in the first half of this verse is a cause for material entanglement. <span class="Italic">K&#257;la,</span> or the time factor, agitates the modes of material nature, and <span class="Italic">svabh&#257;va</span> is the result of association with these modes. Therefore Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura says, <span class="Italic">bhakta-sane v&#257;sa.</span> If one associates with <span class="Italic">bhaktas,</span> then one&rsquo;s <span class="Italic">svabh&#257;va,</span> or nature, will change. Our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is meant to give people good association so that this change may take place, and we actually see that by this method people all over the world are gradually becoming devotees.</div>
<div class="Purport">As for <span class="Italic">sa&#7745;sk&#257;ra,</span> or reformation, this is possible by good association, for by good association one develops good habits, and habit becomes second nature. Therefore, <span class="Italic">bhakta-sane v&#257;sa:</span> let people have the chance to live with <span class="Italic">bhaktas.</span> Then their habits will change. In the human form of life one has this chance, but as Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura sings, <span class="Italic">hari hari viphale janama go&#7749;&#257;inu:</span> if one fails to take advantage of this opportunity, one&rsquo;s human life is wasted. We are therefore trying to save human society from degradation and actually elevate people to the higher nature.</div>
<div class="Purport">As for <span class="Italic">k&#257;ma</span> and <span class="Italic">karma</span>&mdash;desires and activities&mdash;if one engages in devotional service, one develops a different nature than if one engages in activities of sense gratification, and of course the result is also different. According to the association of different natures, one receives a particular type of body. <span class="Italic">K&#257;ra&#7751;a&#7745; gu&#7751;a-sa&#7749;go &rsquo;sya sad-asad-yoni janmasu</span> (Bg. <a href="index4913.html?g=4477">13.22</a>). Therefore we should always seek good association, the association of devotees. Then our life will be successful. A man is known by his company. If one has the chance to live in the good association of devotees, one is able to cultivate knowledge, and naturally one&rsquo;s character or nature will change for one&rsquo;s eternal benefit.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;The Supreme Lord is not obtained by expert explanations, by vast intelligence, or even by much hearing. He is obtained only by one whom He Himself chooses. To such a person, He manifests His own form.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="Purport">One description given of Brahman is <span class="Italic">satya&#7745; brahma, &#257;nanda-r&#363;pam:</span> &ldquo;Brahman is the Absolute Truth and complete <span class="Italic">&#257;nanda,</span> or bliss.&rdquo; The forms of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Supreme Brahman, were one, but They were manifested differently. The followers of the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads,</span> however, cannot understand the varieties manifested by Brahman. This proves that Brahman and Param&#257;tm&#257; can actually he understood only through devotion, as confirmed by the Lord Himself in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam:</span> <span class="Italic">bhakty&#257;ham ekay&#257; gr&#257;hya&#7717;</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> 11.14.21). To establish that Brahman indeed has transcendental form, &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura gives various quotations from the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras.</span> In the <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;vet&#257;&#347;vatara Upani&#7779;ad</span> (3.8), the Supreme is described as <span class="Italic">&#257;ditya-var&#7751;a&#7745; tamasa&#7717; parast&#257;t,</span> &ldquo;He whose self-manifest form is luminous like the sun and transcendental to the darkness of ignorance.&rdquo; <span class="Italic">&#256;nanda-m&#257;tram ajara&#7745; pur&#257;&#7751;am eka&#7745; santa&#7745; bahudh&#257; d&#7771;&#347;yam&#257;nam:</span> &ldquo;The Supreme is blissful, with no tinge of unhappiness.

Rather, Brahman has a transcendental form, and when one is absorbed in it, being fully developed in <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> one can understand Him (<span class="Italic">prem&#257;&ntilde;jana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena</span></I> [Bs. </I>5.38</I>]</I>). The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s, however, cannot understand this transcendental form, for they think that it is material.</div>
<div class="Purport">Transcendental forms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His person are so great that the impersonal followers of the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads</span> cannot reach the platform of knowledge to understand them. Particularly, the transcendental forms of the Lord are beyond the reach of the impersonalists, who can only understand, through the studies of the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads,</span> that the Absolute Truth is not matter and that the Absolute Truth is not materially restricted by limited potency.</div>
<div class="Purport">Yet although K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a cannot be seen through the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads,</span> in some places it is said that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a can in fact be known in this way. <span class="Italic">Aupani&#7779;ada&#7745; puru&#7779;am:</span> &ldquo;He is known by the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads.</span>&rdquo; This means that when one is purified by Vedic knowledge, one is then allowed to enter into devotional understanding (<span class="Italic">mad-bhakti&#7745; labhate par&#257;m</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexc2a1.html?g=5889">18.54</a>]).</div>

<div class="Purport">Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, Brahm&#257; thus realized, is the reservoir of all truth, knowledge and bliss. He is the combination of these three transcendental features, and He is the object of worship for the followers of the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads.</span> Brahm&#257; realized that all the different forms of cows, boys and calves transformed into Vi&#7779;&#7751;u forms were not transformed by mysticism of the type that a <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> or demigod can display by specific powers invested in him. The cows, calves and boys transformed into <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-m&#363;rtis,</span> or Vi&#7779;&#7751;u forms, were not displays of <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-m&#257;y&#257;,</span> or Vi&#7779;&#7751;u energy, but were Vi&#7779;&#7751;u Himself. The respective qualifications of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-m&#257;y&#257;</span> are just like those of fire and heat. In heat there is the qualification of fire, namely warmth; and yet heat is not fire. The manifestation of the Vi&#7779;&#7751;u forms of the boys, cows and calves was not like the heat, but rather like the fire&mdash;they were all actually Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Factually, the qualification of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is full truth, full knowledge and full bliss. Another example may be given with material objects, which may be reflected in many, many forms. For example, the sun is reflected in many waterpots, but the reflections of the sun in many pots are not actually the sun. There is no actual heat and light from the sun in the pot, although it appears as the sun. But each and every one of the forms K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a assumed was fully Vi&#7779;&#7751;u.</div>
<div class="Purport">We should discuss <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> daily as much as possible, and then everything will be clarified, for <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the essence of all Vedic literature (<span class="Italic">nigama-kalpa-taror galita&#7745; phalam</I> [SB </I><a href="index3d57.html?g=6139">1.1.3</a></I>]</span></I>). It was written by Vy&#257;sadeva (<span class="Italic">mah&#257;-muni-k&#7771;te</span>) when he was self-realized. Thus the more we read <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> the more its knowledge becomes clear. Each and every verse is transcendental.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">The Supreme Brahman is beyond mental speculation, He is self-manifest, existing in His own bliss, and He is beyond the material energy. He is known by the crest jewels of the Vedas by refutation of irrelevant knowledge. Thus in relation to that Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead, whose glory had been shown by the manifestation of all the four-armed forms of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, Lord Brahm&#257;, the lord of Sarasvat&#299;, was mystified. &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; he thought, and then he was not even able to see. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, understanding Brahm&#257;&rsquo;s position, then at once removed the curtain of His yogam&#257;y&#257;.<span class="Italic"></span></div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Brahm&#257; was completely mystified. He could not understand what he was seeing, and then he was not even able to see. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, understanding Brahm&#257;&rsquo;s position, then removed that <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;</span> covering. In this verse, Brahm&#257; is referred to as <span class="Italic">ire&#347;a.</span> <span class="Italic">Ir&#257;</span> means Sarasvat&#299;, the goddess of learning, and Ire&#347;a is her husband, Lord Brahm&#257;. Brahm&#257;, therefore, is most intelligent. But even Brahm&#257;, the lord of Sarasvat&#299;, was bewildered about K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Although he tried, he could not understand Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. In the beginning the boys, the calves and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself had been covered by <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;,</span> which later displayed the second set of calves and boys, who were K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s expansions, and which then displayed so many four-armed forms. Now, seeing Brahm&#257;&rsquo;s bewilderment, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a caused the disappearance of that <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;.</span> One may think that the <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> taken away by Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was <span class="Italic">mah&#257;m&#257;y&#257;,</span> but &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura comments that it was <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;,</span> the potency by which K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is sometimes manifest and sometimes not manifest. The potency which covers the actual reality and displays something unreal is <span class="Italic">mah&#257;m&#257;y&#257;,</span> but the potency by which the Absolute Truth is sometimes manifest and sometimes not is <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;.</span> Therefore, in this verse the word <span class="Italic">aj&#257;</span> refers to <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s energy&mdash;His <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;-&#347;akti,</span> or <span class="Italic">svar&#363;pa-&#347;akti</span>&mdash;is one, but it is manifested in varieties. <span class="Italic">par&#257;sya &#347;aktir vividhaiva &#347;r&#363;yate</span> (<span class="Italic">&#346;vet&#257;&#347;vatara Upani&#7779;ad</span> 6.8). The difference between Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas and M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s is that M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s say that this <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> is one, whereas Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas recognize its varieties. There is unity in variety. For example, in one tree, there are varieties of leaves, fruits and flowers. Varieties of energy are required for performing the varieties of activity within the creation. To give another example, in a machine all the parts may be iron, but the machine includes varied activities. Although the whole machine is iron, one part works in one way, and other parts work in other ways. One who does not know how the machine is working may say that it is all iron; nonetheless, in spite of its being iron, the machine has different elements, all working differently to accomplish the purpose for which the machine was made. One wheel runs this way, another wheel runs that way, functioning naturally in such a way that the work of the machine goes on. Consequently we give different names to the different parts of the machine, saying, &ldquo;This is a wheel,&rdquo; &ldquo;This is a screw,&rdquo; &ldquo;This is a spindle,&rdquo; &ldquo;This is the lubrication,&rdquo; and so on. Similarly, as explained in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span></div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">par&#257;sya &#347;aktir vividhaiva &#347;r&#363;yate<br>sv&#257;bh&#257;vik&#299; j&ntilde;&#257;na-bala-kriy&#257; ca</div>
</div><A NAME="128580"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s power is variegated, and thus the same <span class="Italic">&#347;akti,</span> or potency, works in variegated ways. <span class="Italic">Vividh&#257;</span> means &ldquo;varieties.&rdquo; There is unity in variety. Thus <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">mah&#257;m&#257;y&#257;</span> are among the varied individual parts of the same one potency, and all of these individual potencies work in their own varied ways. The <span class="Italic">sa&#7745;vit, sandhin&#299;</span> and <span class="Italic">&#257;hl&#257;din&#299;</span> potencies&mdash;K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s potency for existence, His potency for knowledge and His potency for pleasure&mdash;are distinct from <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;.</span> Each is an individual potency. The <span class="Italic">&#257;hl&#257;din&#299;</span> potency is R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;&#7751;&#299;. As Svar&#363;pa D&#257;modara Gosv&#257;m&#299; has explained, <span class="Italic">r&#257;dh&#257; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-pra&#7751;aya-vik&#7771;tir hl&#257;din&#299; &#347;aktir asm&#257;t</span> (Cc. <span class="Ref_Italic">&#256;di</span> <a href="indexb42c.html?g=80425">1.5</a>). The <span class="Italic">&#257;hl&#257;din&#299;-&#347;akti</span> is manifested as R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;&#7751;&#299;, but K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;&#7751;&#299; are the same, although one is potent and the other is potency.</div>
<div class="Purport">Brahm&#257; was mystified about K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s opulence (<span class="Italic">nija-mahimani</span>) because this opulence was <span class="Italic">atarkya,</span> or inconceivable. With one&rsquo;s limited senses, one cannot argue about that which is inconceivable. Therefore the inconceivable is called <span class="Italic">acintya,</span> that which is beyond <span class="Italic">cintya,</span> our thoughts and arguments. <span class="Italic">Acintya</span> refers to that which we cannot contemplate but have to accept. &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; has said that unless we accept <span class="Italic">acintya</span> in the Supreme, we cannot accommodate the conception of God. This must be understood. Therefore we say that the words of <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra</span> should be taken as they are, without change, since they are beyond our arguments. <span class="Italic">Acinty&#257;&#7717; khalu ye bh&#257;v&#257; na t&#257;&#7745;s tarke&#7751;a yojayet:</span> &ldquo;That which is <span class="Italic">acintya</span> cannot be ascertained by argument.&rdquo; People generally argue, but our process is not to argue but to accept the Vedic knowledge as it is. When K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says, &ldquo;This is superior, and this is inferior,&rdquo; we accept what He says. It is not that we argue, &ldquo;Why is this superior and that inferior?&rdquo; If one argues, for him the knowledge is lost.</div>
<div class="Purport">This path of acceptance is called <span class="Italic">avaroha-panth&#257;</span> The word <span class="Italic">avaroha</span> is related to the word <span class="Italic">avat&#257;ra,</span> which means&rdquo;that which descends.&rdquo; The materialist wants to understand everything by the <span class="Italic">&#257;roha-panth&#257;</span>&mdash;by argument and reason&mdash;but transcendental matters cannot be understood in this way. Rather, one must follow the <span class="Italic">avaroha-panth&#257;,</span> the process of descending knowledge. Therefore one must accept the <span class="Italic">parampar&#257;</span> system. And the best <span class="Italic">parampar&#257;</span> is that which extends from K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (<span class="Italic">eva&#7745; parampar&#257;-pr&#257;ptam</span>). What K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says, we should accept (<span class="Italic">ima&#7745; r&#257;jar&#7779;ayo vidu&#7717;</span>). This is called the <span class="Italic">avaroha-panth&#257;.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">Brahm&#257;, however, adopted the <span class="Italic">&#257;roha-panth&#257;.</span> He wanted to understand K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s mystic power by his own limited, conceivable power, and therefore he himself was mystified. Everyone wants to take pleasure in his own knowledge, thinking, &ldquo;I know something.&rdquo; But in the presence of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a this conception cannot stand, for one cannot bring K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a within the limitations of <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti.</span> One must submit. There is no alternative. <span class="Italic">Na t&#257;&#7745;s tarke&#7751;a yojayet.</span> This submission marks the difference between K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-ites and M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s.</div>
<div class="Purport">The phrase <span class="Italic">atan-nirasana</span> refers to the discarding of that which is irrelevant. (<span class="Italic">Atat</span> means &ldquo;that which is not a fact.&rdquo;) Brahman is sometimes described as <span class="Italic">asth&#363;lam ana&#7751;v ahrasvam ad&#299;rgham,</span> &ldquo;that which is not large and not small, not short and not long.&rdquo; (<span class="Italic">B&#7771;had-&#257;ra&#7751;yaka Upani&#7779;ad</span> 5.8.8) <span class="Italic">Neti neti:</span> &ldquo;It is not this, it is not that.&rdquo; But what is it? In describing a pencil, one may say, &ldquo;It is not this; it is not that,&rdquo; but this does not tell us what it is. This is called definition by negation. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a also explains the soul by giving negative definitions. <span class="Italic">Na j&#257;yate mriyate v&#257;:</span> &ldquo;It is not born, nor does it die. You can hardly understand more than this.&rdquo; But what is it? It is eternal. <span class="Italic">Ajo nitya&#7717; &#347;&#257;&#347;vato &rsquo;ya&#7745; pur&#257;&#7751;o na hanyate hanyam&#257;ne &#347;ar&#299;re:</span> &ldquo;It is unborn, eternal, ever-existing, undying and primeval. It is not slain when the body is slain.&rdquo; (Bg. <a href="indexd7ba.html?g=565">2.20</a>) In the beginning the soul is difficult to understand, and therefore K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a has given negative definitions:</div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">naina&#7745; chindanti &#347;astr&#257;&#7751;i<br>naina&#7745; dahati p&#257;vaka&#7717;<br>na caina&#7745; kledayanty &#257;po<br>na &#347;o&#7779;ayati m&#257;ruta&#7717;</div>
</div><A NAME="128586"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;The soul can never be cut into pieces by any weapon, nor can it be burned by fire, nor moistened by water, nor withered by the wind.&rdquo; (Bg. <a href="index79e0.html?g=592">2.23</a>) K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says, &ldquo;It is not burned by fire.&rdquo; Therefore, one has to imagine what it is that is not burned by fire. This is a negative definition.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">V&#7771;nd&#257;vana is the transcendental abode of the Lord, where there is no hunger, anger or thirst. Though naturally inimical, both human beings and fierce animals live there together in transcendental friendship.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The word <span class="Italic">vana</span> means &ldquo;forest.&rdquo; We are afraid of the forest and do not wish to go there, but in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana the forest animals are as good as demigods, for they have no envy. Even in this material world, in the forest the animals live together, and when they go to drink water they do not attack anyone. Envy develops because of sense gratification, but in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana there is no sense gratification, for the only aim is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s satisfaction. Even in this material world, the animals in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana are not envious of the <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhus</span> who live there. The <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhus</span> keep cows and supply milk to the tigers, saying, &ldquo;Come here and take a little milk.&rdquo; Thus envy and malice are unknown in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana. That is the difference between V&#7771;nd&#257;vana and the ordinary world. We are horrified to hear the name of <span class="Italic">vana,</span> the forest, but in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana there is no such horror. Everyone there is happy by pleasing K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. <span class="Italic">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;otk&#299;rtana-g&#257;na-nartana-parau.</span> Whether a <span class="Italic">gosv&#257;m&#299;</span> or a tiger or other ferocious animal, everyone&rsquo;s business is the same&mdash;to please K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Even the tigers are also devotees. This is the specific qualification of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana. In V&#7771;nd&#257;vana everyone is happy. The calf is happy, the cat is happy, the dog is happy, the man is happy&mdash;everyone. Everyone wants to serve K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in a different capacity, and thus there is no envy. One may sometimes think that the monkeys in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana are envious, because they cause mischief and steal food, but in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana we find that the monkeys are allowed to take butter, which K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself distributes. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a personally demonstrates that everyone has the right to live. This is V&#7771;nd&#257;vana life. Why should I live and you die? No. That is material life. The inhabitants of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana think, &ldquo;Whatever is given by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, let us divide it as <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da</span> and eat.&rdquo; This mentality cannot appear all of a sudden, but it will gradually develop with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness; by <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhana,</span> one can come to this platform.</div>
<div class="Purport">In the material world one may collect funds all over the world in order to distribute food freely, yet those to whom the food is given may not even feel appreciative. The value of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, however, will gradually be very much appreciated. For instance, in an article about the temple of the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a movement in Durban, South Africa, the <span class="Italic">Durban Post</span> reported, &ldquo;All the devotees here are very active in the service of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and the results are obvious to see: happiness, good health, peace of mind, and the development of all good qualities.&rdquo; This is the nature of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana. <span class="Italic">Har&#257;v abhaktasya kuto mahad-gu&#7751;&#257;&#7717;:</span> without K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, happiness is impossible; one may struggle, but one cannot have happiness. We are therefore trying to give human society the opportunity for a life of happiness, good health, peace of mind and all good qualities through God consciousness.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Then Lord Brahm&#257; saw the Absolute Truth&mdash;who is one without a second, who possesses full knowledge and who is unlimited&mdash;assuming the role of a child in a family of cowherd men and standing all alone, just as before, with a morsel of food in His hand, searching everywhere for the calves and His cowherd friends.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The word <span class="Italic">ag&#257;dha-bodham,</span> meaning &ldquo;full of unlimited knowledge,&rdquo; is significant in this verse. The Lord&rsquo;s knowledge is unlimited, and therefore one cannot touch where it ends, just as one cannot measure the ocean. What is the extent of our intelligence in comparison to the vast expanse of water in the ocean? On my passage to America, how insignificant the ship was, like a matchbox in the midst of the ocean. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s intelligence resembles the ocean, for one cannot imagine how vast it is. The best course, therefore, is to surrender to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Don&rsquo;t try to measure K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">advayam,</span> meaning &ldquo;one without a second,&rdquo; is also significant. Because Brahm&#257; was overcast by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> he was thinking himself the Supreme. In the material world, everyone thinks, &ldquo;I am the best man in this world. I know everything.&rdquo; One thinks, &ldquo;Why should I read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;?</span> <span class="Italic">I</span> know everything. I have my own interpretation.&rdquo; Brahm&#257;, however, was able to understand that the Supreme Personality is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. <span class="Italic">&#298;&#347;vara&#7717; parama&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&#7717;</span><I> <span class="Italic"></I>[</I>Bs. </span>5.1</I>]<span class="Italic"></I>.</span> Another of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s names, therefore, is <span class="Italic">parame&#347;vara.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">Now Brahm&#257; saw K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appearing as a cowherd boy in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, not demonstrating His opulence but standing just like an innocent boy with some food in His hand, loitering with His cowherd boyfriends, calves and cows. Brahm&#257; did not see K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as <span class="Italic">catur-bhuja,</span> the opulent N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a; rather, he simply saw an innocent boy. Nonetheless, he could understand that although K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was not demonstrating His power, He was the same Supreme person. people generally do not appreciate someone unless he shows something wonderful, but here, although K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a did not manifest anything wonderful, Brahm&#257; could understand that the same wonderful person was present like an ordinary child, although He was the master of the whole creation. Thus Brahm&#257; prayed, <span class="Italic">govindam &#257;di-puru&#7779;a&#7745; tam aha&#7745; bhaj&#257;mi **:</span> &ldquo;You are the original person, the cause of everything. I bow down to You.&rdquo; This was his realization. <span class="Italic">Tam aha&#7745; bhaj&#257;mi.</span> This is what is wanted. <span class="Italic">Vede&#7779;u durlabham:</span> one cannot reach K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a merely by Vedic knowledge. <span class="Italic">Adurlabham &#257;tma-bhaktau:</span> but when one becomes a devotee, then one can realize Him. Brahm&#257;, therefore, became a devotee. In the beginning he was proud of being Brahm&#257;, the lord of the universe, but now he understood, &ldquo;Here is the Lord of the universe. I am simply an insignificant agent. <span class="Italic">Govindam &#257;di-puru&#7779;a&#7745; tam aha&#7745; bhaj&#257;mi **.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div class="Purport">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was playing like a dramatic actor. Because Brahm&#257; had some false prestige, thinking that he had some power, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a showed him his real position. A similar incident occurred when Brahm&#257; went to see K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in Dv&#257;rak&#257;. When K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s doorman informed Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a that Lord Brahm&#257; had arrived, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a responded, &ldquo;Which Brahm&#257;? Ask him which Brahm&#257;.&rdquo; The doorman relayed this question, and Brahm&#257; was astonished. &ldquo;Is there another Brahm&#257; besides me?&rdquo; he thought. When the doorman informed Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, &ldquo;It is four-headed Brahm&#257;,&rdquo; Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a said, &ldquo;Oh, four-headed. Call others. Show him.&rdquo; This is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s position. For K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a the four-headed Brahm&#257; is insignificant, to say nothing of &ldquo;four-headed scientists.&rdquo; Materialistic scientists think that although this planet earth is full of opulence, all others are vacant. Because they simply speculate, this is their scientific conclusion. But from the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> we understand that the entire universe is full of living entities everywhere. Thus it is the folly of the scientists that although they do not know anything, they mislead people by presenting themselves as scientists, philosophers and men of knowledge.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">After seeing this, Lord Brahm&#257; hastily got down from his swan carrier, fell down like a golden rod and touched the lotus feet of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a with the tips of the four crowns on his heads. Offering his obeisances, he bathed the feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a with the water of his tears of joy.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Lord Brahm&#257; bowed down like a stick, and because Lord Brahm&#257;&rsquo;s complexion is golden, he appeared to be like a golden stick lying down before Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. When one falls down before a superior just like a stick, one&rsquo;s offering of obeisances is called <span class="Italic">da&#7751;&#7693;avat.</span> <span class="Italic">Da&#7751;&#7693;a</span> means &ldquo;stick,&rdquo; and <span class="Italic">vat</span> means &ldquo;like.&rdquo; It is not that one should simply say, <span class="Italic">&ldquo;da&#7751;&#7693;avat.</span>&rdquo; Rather, one must fall down. Thus Brahm&#257; fell down, touching his foreheads to the lotus feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and his crying in ecstasy is to be regarded as an <span class="Italic">abhi&#7779;eka</span> bathing ceremony of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s lotus feet.</div>
<div class="Purport">He who appeared before Brahm&#257; as a human child was in fact the Absolute Truth, Parabrahman (<span class="Italic">brahmeti param&#257;tmeti bhagav&#257;n iti &#347;abdyate</span>). The Supreme Lord is <span class="Italic">nar&#257;k&#7771;ti;</span> that is, He resembles a human being. It is not that He is four-armed (<span class="Italic">catur-b&#257;hu</span>). N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a is <span class="Italic">catur-b&#257;hu,</span> but the Supreme Person resembles a human being. This is also confirmed in the Bible, where it is said that man was made in the image of God.</div>
<div class="Purport">Lord Brahm&#257; saw that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, in His form as a cowherd boy, was Parabrahman, the root cause of everything, but was now appearing as a human child, loitering in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana with a morsel of food in His hand. Astonished, Lord Brahm&#257; hastily got down from his swan carrier and let his body fall to the earth. Usually, the demigods never touch the ground, but Lord Brahm&#257;, voluntarily giving up his prestige as a demigod, bowed down on the ground before K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Although Brahm&#257; has one head in each direction, he voluntarily brought all his heads to the ground and touched K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s feet with the tips of his four helmets. Although his intelligence works in every direction, he surrendered everything before the boy K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>
<div class="Purport">It is mentioned that Brahm&#257; washed the feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a with his tears, and here the word <span class="Italic">sujalai&#7717;</span> indicates that his tears were purified. As soon as <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is present, everything is purified (<span class="Italic">sarvop&#257;dhi-vinirmuktam</span></I> [Cc. Madhya </I><a href="index663c.html?g=124289">19.170</a></I>]</I>). Therefore Brahm&#257;&rsquo;s crying was a form of <span class="Italic">bhakty-anubh&#257;va,</span> a transformation of transcendental ecstatic love.</div>
