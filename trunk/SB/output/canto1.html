<div class="chapnum">Introduction</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The conception of God and the conception of Absolute Truth are not on the same level. The <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> hits on the target of the Absolute Truth. The conception of God indicates the controller, whereas the conception of the Absolute Truth indicates the <span class="Italic">summum bonum</span> or the ultimate source of all energies. There is no difference of opinion about the personal feature of God as the controller because a controller cannot be impersonal. Of course modern government, especially democratic government, is impersonal to some extent, but ultimately the chief executive head is a person, and the impersonal feature of government is subordinate to the personal feature. So without a doubt whenever we refer to control over others we must admit the existence of a personal feature. Because there are different controllers for different managerial positions, there may be many small gods. According to the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> any controller who has some specific extraordinary power is called a <span class="Italic">vibh&#363;timat sattva,</span> or controller empowered by the Lord. There are many <span class="Italic">vibh&#363;timat sattvas,</span> controllers or gods with various specific powers, but the Absolute Truth is one without a second. This <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> designates the Absolute Truth or the <span class="Italic">summum bonum</span> as the <span class="Italic">para&#7745; satyam.</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The author of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva, first offers his respectful obeisances unto the <span class="Italic">para&#7745; satyam</span> (Absolute Truth), and because the <span class="Italic">para&#7745; satyam</span> is the ultimate source of all energies, the <span class="Italic">para&#7745; satyam</span> is the Supreme Person. The gods or the controllers are undoubtedly persons, but the <span class="Italic">para&#7745; satyam</span> from whom the gods derive powers of control is the Supreme Person. The Sanskrit word <span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;vara</span> (controller) conveys the import of God, but the Supreme Person is called the <span class="Italic">parame&#347;vara,</span> or the supreme <span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;vara.</span> The Supreme Person, or <span class="Italic">parame&#347;vara,</span> is the supreme conscious personality, and because He does not derive any power from any other source, He is supremely independent. In the Vedic literatures Brahm&#257; is described as the supreme god or the head of all other gods like Indra, Candra and Varu&#7751;a, but the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> confirms that even Brahm&#257; is not independent as far as his power and knowledge are concerned. He received knowledge in the form of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> from the Supreme Person who resides within the heart of every living being. That Supreme Personality knows everything directly and indirectly. Individual infinitesimal persons, who are parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality, may know directly and indirectly everything about their bodies or external features, but the Supreme Personality knows everything about both His external and internal features.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><JD:"Destination-2">The words <span class="Italic">janm&#257;dy asya</I> [SB </I><a href="index4dab.html?g=6120">1.1.1</a></I>]</span></I> suggest that the source of all production, maintenance or destruction is the same supreme conscious person. Even in our present experience we can know that nothing is generated from inert matter, but inert matter can be generated from the living entity. For instance, by contact with the living entity, the material body develops into a working machine. Men with a poor fund of knowledge mistake the bodily machinery to be the living being, but the fact is that the living being is the basis of the bodily machine. The bodily machine is useless as soon as the living spark is away from it. Similarly, the original source of all material energy is the Supreme Person. This fact is expressed in all the Vedic literatures, and all the exponents of spiritual science have accepted this truth. The living force is called Brahman, and one of the greatest <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> (teachers), namely &#346;r&#299;p&#257;da &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya, has preached that Brahman is substance whereas the cosmic world is category. The original source of all energies is the living force, and He is logically accepted as the Supreme Person. He is therefore conscious of everything past, present and future, and also of each and every corner of His manifestations, both material and spiritual. An imperfect living being does not even know what is happening within his own personal body. He eats his food but does not know how this food is transformed into energy or how it sustains his body. When a living being is perfect, he is aware of everything that happens, and since the Supreme Person is all-perfect, it is quite natural that He knows everything in all detail. Consequently the perfect personality is addressed in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> as V&#257;sudeva, or one who lives everywhere in full consciousness and in full possession of His complete energy. All of this is clearly explained in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> and the reader has ample opportunity to study this critically.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In the modern age Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu preached the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> by practical demonstration. It is easier to penetrate into the topics of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> through the medium of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya's causeless mercy. Therefore a short sketch of His life and precepts is inserted herein to help the reader understand the real merit of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><JD:"Destination-4">It is imperative that one learn the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> from the person <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> The person <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is one whose very life is <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> in practice. Since &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu is the Absolute Personality of Godhead, He is both Bhagav&#257;n and <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> in person and in sound. Therefore His process of approaching the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is practical for all people of the world. It was His wish that the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> be preached in every nook and corner of the world by those who happened to take their birth in India.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><JD:"Destination-5">The <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the science of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Absolute Personality of Godhead of whom we have preliminary information from the text of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu has said that anyone, regardless of what he is, who is well versed in the science of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (<span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> and <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span>) can become an authorized preacher or preceptor in the science of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">There is a need for the science of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in human society for the good of all suffering humanity of the world, and we simply request the leaders of all nations to pick up this science of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a for their own good, for the good of society and for the good of all the world's people.</div>
<div class="Lecture-Heading"><JD:"Destination-6">A short sketch of the life and teachings of Lord Caitanya,<br>The Preacher of <span class="Italic"><B></I>&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span></B></I></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, the great apostle of love of God and the father of the congregational chanting of the holy name of the Lord, advented Himself at &#346;r&#299;dh&#257;ma M&#257;y&#257;pura, a quarter in the city of Navadv&#299;pa in Bengal, on the Ph&#257;lgun&#299; P&#363;r&#7751;im&#257; evening in the year 1407 &#346;ak&#257;bda (corresponding to February 1486 by the Christian calendar).</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">His father, &#346;r&#299; Jagann&#257;tha Mi&#347;ra, a learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> from the district of Sylhet, came to Navadv&#299;pa as a student because at that time Navadv&#299;pa was considered to be the center of education and culture. He domiciled on the banks of the Ganges after marrying &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; &#346;ac&#299;dev&#299;, a daughter of &#346;r&#299;la N&#299;l&#257;mbara Cakravart&#299;, the great learned scholar of Navadv&#299;pa.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Jagann&#257;tha Mi&#347;ra had a number of daughters by his wife, &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; &#346;ac&#299;dev&#299;, and most of them expired at an early age. Two surviving sons, &#346;r&#299; Vi&#347;var&#363;pa and Vi&#347;vambhara, became at last the object of their paternal affection. The tenth and youngest son, who was named Vi&#347;vambhara, later became known as Nim&#257;i Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita and then, after accepting the renounced order of life, Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu exhibited His transcendental activities for forty-eight years and then disappeared in the year 1455 &#346;ak&#257;bda at Pur&#299;.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">For His first twenty-four years He remained at Navadv&#299;pa as a student and householder. His first wife was &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; Lak&#7779;m&#299;priy&#257;, who died at an early age when the Lord was away from home. When He returned from East Bengal He was requested by His mother to accept a second wife, and He agreed. His second wife was &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;upriy&#257; Dev&#299;, who bore the separation of the Lord throughout her life because the Lord took the order of <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> at the age of twenty-four, when &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;upriy&#257; was barely sixteen years old.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">After taking <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa,</span> the Lord made His headquarters at Jagann&#257;tha Pur&#299; due to the request of His mother, &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; &#346;ac&#299;dev&#299;. The Lord remained for twenty-four years at Pur&#299;. For six years of this time He traveled continuously all over India (and especially throughout southern India) preaching the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Lord Caitanya not only preached the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> but propagated the teachings of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as well in the most practical way. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is depicted as the Absolute Personality of Godhead, and His last teachings in that great book of transcendental knowledge instruct that one should give up all the modes of religious activities and accept Him (Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a) as the <span class="Italic">only</span> worshipable Lord. The Lord then assured that all His devotees would be protected from all sorts of sinful acts and that for them there would be no cause for anxiety.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Unfortunately, despite Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's direct order and the teachings of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> less intelligent people misunderstand Him to be nothing but a great historical personality, and thus they cannot accept Him as the original Personality of Godhead. Such men with a poor fund of knowledge are misled by many nondevotees. Thus the teachings of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> were misinterpreted even by great scholars. After the disappearance of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a there were hundreds of commentaries on the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> by many erudite scholars, and almost every one of them was motivated by self-interest.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu is the selfsame Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. This time, however, He appeared as a great devotee of the Lord in order to preach to the people in general, as well as to religionists and philosophers, about the transcendental position of &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the primeval Lord and the cause of all causes. The essence of His preaching is that Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who appeared at Vrajabh&#363;mi (V&#7771;nd&#257;vana) as the son of the King of Vraja (Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja), is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is therefore worshipable by all. V&#7771;nd&#257;vana-dh&#257;ma is nondifferent from the Lord because the name, fame, form and place where the Lord manifests Himself are all identical with the Lord as absolute knowledge. Therefore V&#7771;nd&#257;vana-dh&#257;ma is as worshipable as the Lord. The highest form of transcendental worship of the Lord was exhibited by the damsels of Vrajabh&#363;mi in the form of pure affection for the Lord, and Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu recommends this process as the most excellent mode of worship. He accepts the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavata Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> as the spotless literature for understanding the Lord, and He preaches that the ultimate goal of life for all human beings is to attain the stage of <span class="Italic">prem&#257;,</span> or love of God.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Many devotees of Lord Caitanya like &#346;r&#299;la V&#7771;nd&#257;vana d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura, &#346;r&#299; Locana d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura, &#346;r&#299;la K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;ad&#257;sa Kavir&#257;ja Gosv&#257;m&#299;, &#346;r&#299; Kavikar&#7751;ap&#363;ra, &#346;r&#299; Prabodh&#257;nanda Sarasvat&#299;, &#346;r&#299; R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299;, &#346;r&#299; San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299;, &#346;r&#299; Raghun&#257;tha Bha&#7789;&#7789;a Gosv&#257;m&#299;, &#346;r&#299; J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;, &#346;r&#299; Gop&#257;la Bha&#7789;&#7789;a Gosv&#257;m&#299;, &#346;r&#299; Raghun&#257;tha d&#257;sa Gosv&#257;m&#299; and in this latter age within two hundred years, &#346;r&#299; Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299;, &#346;r&#299; Baladeva Vidy&#257;bh&#363;&#7779;ana, &#346;r&#299; &#346;y&#257;m&#257;nanda Gosv&#257;m&#299;, &#346;r&#299; Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura, &#346;r&#299; Bhaktivinoda &#7788;h&#257;kura and at last &#346;r&#299; Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura (our spiritual master) and many other great and renowned scholars and devotees of the Lord have prepared voluminous books and literatures on the life and precepts of the Lord. Such literatures are all based on the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> like the <span class="Italic">Vedas, Pur&#257;&#7751;as, Upani&#7779;ads, R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a, Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> and other histories and authentic literatures approved by the recognized <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas.</span> They are unique in composition and unrivaled in presentation, and they are full of transcendental knowledge. Unfortunately the people of the world are still ignorant of them, but when these literatures, which are mostly in Sanskrit and Bengali, come to light the world and when they are presented before thinking people, then India's glory and the message of love will overflood this morbid world, which is vainly searching after peace and prosperity by various illusory methods not approved by the <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> in the chain of disciplic succession.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The readers of this small description of the life and precepts of Lord Caitanya will profit much to go through the books of &#346;r&#299;la V&#7771;nd&#257;vana d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura (<span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299; Caitanya-bh&#257;gavata</span>) and &#346;r&#299;la K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;ad&#257;sa Kavir&#257;ja Gosv&#257;m&#299; (<span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299; Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta</span>). The early life of the Lord is most fascinatingly expressed by the author of <span class="Italic">Caitanya-bh&#257;gavata,</span> and as far as the teachings are concerned, they are more vividly explained in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta.</span> Now they are available to the English-speaking public in our <span class="Italic">Teachings of Lord Caitanya.</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The Lord's early life was recorded by one of His chief devotees and contemporaries, namely &#346;r&#299;la Mur&#257;ri Gupta, a medical practitioner of that time, and the latter part of the life of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu was recorded by His private secretary &#346;r&#299; D&#257;modara Gosv&#257;m&#299;, or &#346;r&#299;la Svar&#363;pa D&#257;modara, who was practically a constant companion of the Lord at Pur&#299;. These two devotees recorded practically all the incidents of the Lord's activities, and later on all the books dealing with the Lord, which are above mentioned, were composed on the basis of <span class="Italic">ka&#7693;ac&#257;s</span> (notebooks) by &#346;r&#299;la D&#257;modara Gosv&#257;m&#299; and Mur&#257;ri Gupta.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><JD:"Destination-7">So the Lord advented Himself on the Ph&#257;lgun&#299; P&#363;r&#7751;im&#257; evening of 1407 &#346;ak&#257;bda, and it was by the will of the Lord that there was a lunar eclipse on that evening. During the hours of eclipse it was the custom of the Hindu public to take bath in the Ganges or any other sacred river and chant the Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras</span> for purification. When Lord Caitanya was born during the lunar eclipse, all India was roaring with the holy sound of Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare Hare/ Hare R&#257;ma, Hare R&#257;ma, R&#257;ma R&#257;ma, Hare Hare. These sixteen names of the Lord are mentioned in many <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> and <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads,</span> and they are described as the <span class="Italic">T&#257;raka-brahma n&#257;ma</span> of this age. It is recommended in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> that offenseless chanting of these holy names of the Lord can deliver a fallen soul from material bondage. There are innumerable names of the Lord both in India and outside, and all of them are equally good because all of them indicate the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But because these sixteen are especially recommended for this age, people should take advantage of them and follow the path of the great <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> who attained success by practicing the rules of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> (revealed scriptures).</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><JD:"Destination-8">The simultaneous occurrence of the Lord's appearance and the lunar eclipse indicated the distinctive mission of the Lord. This mission was to preach the importance of chanting the holy names of the Lord in this age of Kali (quarrel). In this present age quarrels take place even over trifles, and therefore the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> have recommended for this age a common platform for realization, namely chanting the holy names of the Lord. People can hold meetings to glorify the Lord in their respective languages and with melodious songs, and if such performances are executed in an offenseless manner, it is certain that the participants will gradually attain spiritual perfection without having to undergo more rigorous methods. At such meetings everyone, the learned and the foolish, the rich and the poor, the Hindus and the Muslims, the Englishmen and the Indians, and the <span class="Italic">ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;las</span> and the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> can all hear the transcendental sounds and thus cleanse the dust of material association from the mirror of the heart. To confirm the Lord's mission, all the people of the world will accept the holy name of the Lord as the common platform for the universal religion of mankind. In other words, the advent of the holy name took place along with the advent of Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><JD:"Destination-9">When the Lord was on the lap of His mother, He would at once stop crying as soon as the ladies surrounding Him chanted the holy names and clapped their hands. This peculiar incident was observed by the neighbors with awe and veneration. Sometimes the young girls took pleasure in making the Lord cry and then stopping Him by chanting the holy name. So from His very childhood the Lord began to preach the importance of the holy name. In His early age Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya was known as Nim&#257;i. This name was given by His beloved mother because the Lord took His birth beneath a <span class="Italic">nimba</span> tree in the courtyard of His paternal house.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">When the Lord was offered solid food at the age of six months in the <span class="Italic">anna-pr&#257;&#347;ana</span> ceremony, the Lord indicated His future activities. At this time it was customary to offer the child both coins and books in order to get some indication of the future tendencies of the child. The Lord was offered on one side coins and on the other the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> The Lord accepted the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> instead of the coins.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">When He was a mere baby crawling in the yard, one day a snake appeared before Him, and the Lord began to play with it. All the members of the house were struck with fear and awe, but after a little while the snake went away, and the baby was taken away by His mother. Once He was stolen by a thief who intended to steal His ornaments, but the Lord took a pleasure trip on the shoulder of the bewildered thief, who was searching for a solitary place in order to rob the baby. It so happened that the thief, wandering hither and thither, finally arrived just before the house of Jagann&#257;tha Mi&#347;ra and, being afraid of being caught, dropped the baby at once. Of course the anxious parents and relatives were glad to see the lost child.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Once a pilgrim <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> was received at the house of Jagann&#257;tha Mi&#347;ra, and when he was offering food to the Godhead, the Lord appeared before him and partook of the prepared food. The eatables had to be rejected because the child touched them, and so the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> had to make another preparation. The next time the same thing happened, and when this happened repeatedly for the third time, the baby was finally put to bed. At about twelve at night when all the members of the house were fast asleep within their closed rooms, the pilgrim <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> offered his specially prepared foods to the Deity, and, in the same way, the baby Lord appeared before the pilgrim and spoiled his offerings. The <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> then began to cry, but since everyone was fast asleep, no one could hear him. At that time the baby Lord appeared before the fortunate <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> and disclosed His identity as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself. The <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> was forbidden to disclose this incident, and the baby returned to the lap of His mother.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><JD:"Destination-10">There are many similar incidents in His childhood. As a naughty boy He sometimes used to tease the orthodox <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> who used to bathe in the Ganges. When the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> complained to His father that He was splashing them with water instead of attending school, the Lord suddenly appeared before His father as though just coming from school with all His school clothes and books. At the bathing <span class="Italic">gh&#257;&#7789;a</span> He also used to play jokes on the neighboring girls who engaged in worshiping &#346;iva in hopes of getting good husbands. This is a common practice amongst unmarried girls in Hindu families. While they were engaged in such worship, the Lord naughtily appeared before them and said, "My dear sisters, please give Me all the offerings you have just brought for Lord &#346;iva. Lord &#346;iva is My devotee, and P&#257;rvat&#299; is My maidservant. If you worship Me, then Lord &#346;iva and all the other demigods will be more satisfied." Some of them refused to obey the naughty Lord, and He would curse them that due to their refusal they would be married to old men who had seven children by their previous wives. Out of fear and sometimes out of love the girls would also offer Him various goods, and then the Lord would bless them and assure them that they would have very good young husbands and that they would be mothers of dozens of children. The blessings would enliven the girls, but they used often to complain of these incidents to their mothers.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In this way the Lord passed His early childhood. When He was just sixteen years old He started His own <span class="Italic">catu&#7779;p&#257;&#7789;h&#299;</span> (village school conducted by a learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a).</span> In this school He would simply explain K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, even in readings of grammar. &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;, in order to please the Lord, later composed a grammar in Sanskrit, in which all the rules of grammar were explained with examples that used the holy names of the Lord. This grammar is still current. It is known as <span class="Italic">Hari-n&#257;m&#257;m&#7771;ta-vy&#257;kara&#7751;a</span> and is prescribed in the syllabus of schools in Bengal.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">During this time a great Kashmir scholar named Ke&#347;ava K&#257;&#347;m&#299;r&#299; came to Navadv&#299;pa to hold discussions on the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras.</span> The Kashmir <span class="Italic">pa&#7751;&#7693;ita</span> was a champion scholar, and he had traveled to all places of learning in India. Finally he came to Navadv&#299;pa to contest the learned <span class="Italic">pa&#7751;&#7693;itas</span> there. The <span class="Italic">pa&#7751;&#7693;itas</span> of Navadv&#299;pa decided to match Nim&#257;i Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita (Lord Caitanya) with the Kashmir <span class="Italic">pa&#7751;&#7693;ita,</span> thinking that if Nim&#257;i Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita were defeated, they would have another chance to debate with the scholar, for Nim&#257;i Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita was only a boy. And if the Kashmir <span class="Italic">pa&#7751;&#7693;ita</span> were defeated, then they would even be more glorified because people would proclaim that a mere boy of Navadv&#299;pa had defeated a champion scholar who was famous throughout India. It so happened that Nim&#257;i Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita met Ke&#347;ava K&#257;&#347;m&#299;r&#299; while strolling on the banks of the Ganges. The Lord requested him to compose a Sanskrit verse in praise of the Ganges, and the <span class="Italic">pa&#7751;&#7693;ita</span> within a short time composed a hundred <span class="Italic">&#347;lokas,</span> reciting the verses like a storm and showing the strength of his vast learning. Nim&#257;i Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita at once memorized all the <span class="Italic">&#347;lokas</span> without an error. He quoted the sixty-fourth <span class="Italic">&#347;loka</span> and pointed out certain rhetorical and literary irregularities. He particularly questioned the <span class="Italic">pa&#7751;&#7693;ita's</span> use of the word <span class="Italic">bhav&#257;n&#299;-bhartu&#7717;.</span> He pointed out that the use of this word was redundant. <span class="Italic">Bhav&#257;n&#299;</span> means the wife of &#346;iva, and who else can be her <span class="Italic">bhart&#257;,</span> or husband? He also pointed out several other discrepancies, and the Kashmir <span class="Italic">pa&#7751;&#7693;ita</span> was struck with wonder. He was astonished that a mere student of grammar could point out the literary mistakes of an erudite scholar. Although this matter was ended prior to any public meeting, the news spread like wildfire all over Navadv&#299;pa. But finally Ke&#347;ava K&#257;&#347;m&#299;r&#299; was ordered in a dream by Sarasvat&#299;, the goddess of learning, to submit to the Lord, and thus the Kashmir <span class="Italic">pa&#7751;&#7693;ita</span> became a follower of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><JD:"Destination-11">The Lord was then married with great pomp and gaiety, and at this time He began to preach the congregational chanting of the holy name of, the Lord at Navadv&#299;pa. Some of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> became envious of His popularity, and they put many hindrances on His path. They were so jealous that they finally took the matter before the Muslim magistrate at Navadv&#299;pa. Bengal was then governed by Pathans, and the governor of the province was Nawab Hussain Shah. The Muslim magistrate of Navadv&#299;pa took up the complaints of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> seriously, and at first he warned the followers of Nim&#257;i Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita not to chant loudly the name of Hari. But Lord Caitanya asked His followers to disobey the orders of the Kazi, and they went on with their <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> (chanting) party as usual. The magistrate then sent constables who interrupted a <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> and broke some of the <span class="Italic">m&#7771;da&#7749;gas</span> (drums). When Nim&#257;i Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita heard of this incident He organized a party for civil disobedience. He is the pioneer of the civil disobedience movement in India for the right cause. He organized a procession of one hundred thousand men with thousands of <span class="Italic">m&#7771;da&#7749;gas</span> and <span class="Italic">karat&#257;las</span> (hand cymbals), and this procession passed over the roads of Navadv&#299;pa in defiance of the Kazi who had issued the order. Finally the procession reached the house of the Kazi, who went upstairs out of fear of the masses. The great crowds assembled at the Kazi's house displayed a violent temper, but the Lord asked them to be peaceful. At this time the Kazi came down and tried to pacify the Lord by addressing Him as his nephew. He pointed out that N&#299;l&#257;mbara Cakravart&#299; referred to him as an uncle, and consequently, &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; &#346;ac&#299;dev&#299;, the mother of Nim&#257;i Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita, was his sister. He asked the Lord whether his sister's son could be angry at His maternal uncle, and the Lord replied that since the Kazi was His maternal uncle he should receive his nephew well at his home. In this way the issue was mitigated, and the two learned scholars began a long discussion on the Koran and Hindu <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras.</span> The Lord raised the question of cow-killing, and the Kazi properly answered Him by referring to the Koran. In turn the Kazi also questioned the Lord about cow sacrifice in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> and the Lord replied that such sacrifice as mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is not actually cow-killing. In that sacrifice an old bull or cow was sacrificed for the sake of receiving a fresh younger life by the power of Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras.</span> But in the Kali-yuga such cow sacrifices are forbidden because there are no qualified <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> capable of conducting such a sacrifice. In fact, in Kali-yuga all <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;as</span> (sacrifices) are forbidden because they are useless attempts by foolish men. In Kali-yuga only the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana yaj&ntilde;a</span> is recommended for all practical purposes. Speaking in this way, the Lord finally convinced the Kazi, who became the Lord's follower. The Kazi thenceforth declared that no one should hinder the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> movement which was started by the Lord, and the Kazi left this order in his will for the sake of progeny. The Kazi's tomb still exists in the area of Navadv&#299;pa, and Hindu pilgrims go there to show their respects. The Kazi's descendants are residents, and they never objected to <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana,</span> even during the Hindu-Muslim riot days.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">This incident shows clearly that the Lord was not a so-called timid Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. A Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is a fearless devotee of the Lord, and for the right cause he can take any step suitable for the purpose. Arjuna was also a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava devotee of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and he fought valiantly for the satisfaction of the Lord. Similarly, Vajr&#257;&#7749;gaj&#299;, or Hanum&#257;n, was also a devotee of Lord R&#257;ma, and he gave lessons to the nondevotee party of R&#257;va&#7751;a. The principles of Vai&#7779;&#7751;avism are to satisfy the Lord by all means. A Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is by nature a nonviolent, peaceful living being, and he has all the good qualities of God, but when the nondevotee blasphemes the Lord or His devotee, the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava never tolerates such impudency.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">After this incident the Lord began to preach and propagate His <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata-dharma,</span> or <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> movement, more vigorously, and whoever stood against this propagation of the <span class="Italic">yuga-dharma,</span> or duty of the age, was properly punished by various types of chastisement. Two <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> gentlemen named C&#257;pala and Gop&#257;la, who also happened to be maternal uncles of the Lord, were inflicted with leprosy by way of chastisement, and later, when they were repentant, they were accepted by the Lord. In the course of His preaching work, He used to send daily all His followers, including &#346;r&#299;la Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu and &#7788;h&#257;kura Harid&#257;sa, two chief whips of His party, from door to door to preach the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> All of Navadv&#299;pa was surcharged with His <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> movement, and His headquarters were situated at the house of &#346;r&#299;v&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura and &#346;r&#299; Advaita Prabhu, two of His chief householder disciples. These two learned heads of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> community were the most ardent supporters of Lord Caitanya's movement. &#346;r&#299; Advaita Prabhu was the chief cause for the advent of the Lord. When Advaita Prabhu saw that the total human society was full of materialistic activities and devoid of devotional service, which alone could save mankind from the threefold miseries of material existence, He, out of His causeless compassion for the age-worn human society, prayed fervently for the incarnation of the Lord and continually worshiped the Lord with water of the Ganges and leaves of the holy <span class="Italic">tulas&#299;</span> tree. As far as preaching work in the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> movement was concerned, everyone was expected to do his daily share according to the order of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><JD:"Destination-12">Once Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu and &#346;r&#299;la Harid&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura were walking down a main road, and on the way they saw a roaring crowd assembled. Upon inquiring from passers-by, they understood that two brothers, named Jag&#257;i and M&#257;dh&#257;i, were creating a public disturbance in a drunken state. They also heard that these two brothers were born in a respectable <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> family, but because of low association they had turned into debauchees of the worst type. They were not only drunkards but also meat-eaters, woman-hunters, dacoits and sinners of all description. &#346;r&#299;la Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu heard all of these stories and decided that these two fallen souls must be the first to be delivered. If they were delivered from their sinful life, then the good name of Lord Caitanya would be even still more glorified. Thinking in this way, Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu and Harid&#257;sa pushed their way through the crowd and asked the two brothers to chant the holy name of Lord Hari. The drunken brothers became enraged upon this request and attacked Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu with filthy language. Both brothers chased them a considerable distance. In the evening the report of the preaching work was submitted to the Lord, and He was glad to learn that Nity&#257;nanda and Harid&#257;sa had attempted to deliver such a stupid pair of fellows.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The next day Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu went to see the brothers, and as soon as He approached them one of them threw a piece of earthen pot at Him. This struck Him on the forehead, and immediately blood began to flow. But Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu was so kind that instead of protesting this heinous act, He said, "It does not matter that you have thrown this stone at Me. I still request you to chant the holy name of Lord Hari."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">One of the brothers, Jag&#257;i, was astonished to see this behavior of Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu, and he at once fell down at His feet and asked Him to pardon his sinful brother. When M&#257;dh&#257;i again attempted to hurt Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu, Jag&#257;i stopped him and implored him to fall down at His feet. In the meantime the news of Nity&#257;nanda's injury reached the Lord, who at once hurried to the spot in a fiery and angry mood. The Lord immediately invoked His Sudar&#347;ana <span class="Italic">cakra</span> (the Lord's ultimate weapon, shaped like a wheel) to kill the sinners, but Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu reminded Him of His mission. The mission of the Lord was to deliver the hopelessly fallen souls of Kali-yuga, and the brothers Jag&#257;i and M&#257;dh&#257;i were typical examples of these fallen souls. Ninety percent of the population of this age resembles these brothers, despite high birth and mundane respectability. According to the verdict of the revealed scriptures, the total population of the world in this age will be of the lowest <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> quality, or even lower. It should be noted that &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu never acknowledged the stereotyped caste system by birthright; rather, He strictly followed the verdict of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> in the matter of one's <span class="Italic">svar&#363;pa,</span> or real identity.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">When the Lord was invoking His Sudar&#347;ana <span class="Italic">cakra</span> and &#346;r&#299;la Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu was imploring Him to forgive the two brothers, both the brothers fell down at the lotus feet of the Lord and begged His pardon for their gross behavior. The Lord was also asked by Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu to accept these repenting souls, and the Lord agreed to accept them on one condition, that they henceforward completely give up all their sinful activities and habits of debauchery, both the brothers agreed and promised to give up all their sinful habits, and the kind Lord accepted them and did not again refer to their past misdeeds.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">This is the specific kindness of Lord Caitanya. In this age no one can say that he is free from sin. It is impossible for anyone to say this. But Lord Caitanya accepts all kinds of sinful persons on the one condition that they promise not to indulge in sinful habits after being spiritually initiated by the bona fide spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">There are a number of instructive points to he observed in this incident of the two brothers. In this Kali-yuga practically all people are of the quality of Jag&#257;i and M&#257;dh&#257;i. If they want to be relieved from the reactions of their misdeeds, they must take shelter of Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu and after spiritual initiation thus refrain from those things which are prohibited in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras.</span> The prohibitory rules are dealt with in the Lord's teachings to &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299;.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">During His householder life, the Lord did not display many of the miracles which are generally expected from such personalities, but He did once perform a wonderful miracle in the house of &#346;r&#299;niv&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura while <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> was in full swing. He asked the devotees what they wanted to eat, and when He was informed that they wanted to eat mangoes, He asked for a seed of a mango, although this fruit was out of season. When the seed was brought to Him He sowed it in the yard of &#346;r&#299;niv&#257;sa, and at once a creeper began to grow out of the seed. Within no time this creeper became a full-grown mango tree heavy with more ripened fruits than the devotees could eat. The tree remained in &#346;r&#299;niv&#257;sa's yard, and from then on the devotees used to take as many mangoes from the tree as they wanted.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The Lord had a very high estimation of the affections of the damsels of Vrajabh&#363;mi (V&#7771;nd&#257;vana) for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and in appreciation of their unalloyed service to the Lord, once &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu chanted the holy names of the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> (cowherd girls) instead of the names of the Lord. At this time some of His students, who were also disciples, came to see Him, and when they saw that the Lord was chanting the names of the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s,</span> they were astonished. Out of sheer foolishness they asked the Lord why He was chanting the names of the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> and advised Him to chant the name of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The Lord, who was in ecstasy, was thus disturbed by these foolish students. He chastised them and chased them away. The students were almost the same age as the Lord, and thus they wrongly thought of the Lord as one of their peers. They held a meeting and resolved that they would attack the Lord if He dared to punish them again in such a manner. This incident provoked some malicious talks about the Lord on the part of the general public.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><JD:"Destination-13">When the Lord became aware of this, He began to consider the various types of men found in society. He noted that especially the students, professors, fruitive workers, <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s,</span> nondevotees, and different types of atheists were all opposed to the devotional service of the Lord. "My mission is to deliver all the fallen souls of this age," He thought, "but if they commit offenses against Me, thinking Me to be an ordinary man, they will not benefit. If they are to begin their life of spiritual realization, they must some way or another offer obeisances unto Me." Thus the Lord decided to accept the renounced order of life (<span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span>) because people in general were inclined to offer respects to a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;.</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Five hundred years ago the condition of society was not as degraded as it is today. At that time people would show respects to a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;,</span> and the <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> was rigid in following the rules and regulations of the renounced order of life. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu was not very much in favor of the renounced order of life in this age of Kali, but that was only for the reason that very few <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s</span> in this age are able to observe the rules and regulations of <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> life. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu decided to accept the order and become an ideal <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> so that the general populace would show Him respect. One is duty-bound to show respect to a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;,</span> for a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> is considered to be the master of all <span class="Italic">var&#7751;as</span> and <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;ramas.</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">While He was contemplating accepting the <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> order, it so happened that Ke&#347;ava Bh&#257;rat&#299;, a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> of the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; school and resident of Katwa (in Bengal), visited Navadv&#299;pa and was invited to dine with the Lord. When Ke&#347;ava Bh&#257;rat&#299; came to His house, the Lord asked him to award Him the <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> order of life. This was a matter of formality. The <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> order is to be accepted from another <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;.</span> Although the Lord was independent in all respects, still, to keep up the formalities of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras,</span> He accepted the <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> order from Ke&#347;ava Bh&#257;rat&#299;, although Ke&#347;ava Bh&#257;rat&#299; was not in the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-samprad&#257;ya (school).</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">After consulting with Ke&#347;ava Bh&#257;rat&#299;, the Lord left Navadv&#299;pa for Katwa to formally accept the <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> order of life. He was accompanied by &#346;r&#299;la Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu, Candra&#347;ekhara &#256;c&#257;rya, and Mukunda Datta. Those three assisted Him in the details of the ceremony. The incident of the Lord's accepting the <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> order is very elaborately described in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-bh&#257;gavata</span> by &#346;r&#299;la V&#7771;nd&#257;vana d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Thus at the end of His twenty-fourth year the Lord accepted the <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> order of life in the month of M&#257;gha. After accepting this order He became a full-fledged preacher of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata-dharma.</span> Although He was doing the same preaching work in His householder life, when He experienced some obstacles to His preaching He sacrificed even the comfort of His home life for the sake of the fallen souls. In His householder life His chief assistants were &#346;r&#299;la Advaita Prabhu and &#346;r&#299;la &#346;r&#299;v&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura, but after He accepted the <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> order His chief assistants became &#346;r&#299;la Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu, who was deputed to preach specifically in Bengal, and the six Gosv&#257;m&#299;s (R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299;, San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299;, J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;, Gop&#257;la Bha&#7789;&#7789;a Gosv&#257;m&#299;, Raghun&#257;tha d&#257;sa Gosv&#257;m&#299; and Raghun&#257;tha Bha&#7789;&#7789;a Gosv&#257;m&#299;), headed by &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa and San&#257;tana, who were deputed to go to V&#7771;nd&#257;vana to excavate the present places of pilgrimage. The present city of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana and the importance of Vrajabh&#363;mi were thus disclosed by the will of Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The Lord, after accepting the <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> order, at once wanted to start for V&#7771;nd&#257;vana. For three continuous days He traveled in the R&#257;&#7693;ha-de&#347;a (places where the Ganges does not flow). He was in full ecstasy over the idea of going to V&#7771;nd&#257;vana. However, &#346;r&#299;la Nity&#257;nanda diverted His path and brought Him instead to the house of Advaita Prabhu in &#346;&#257;ntipura. The Lord stayed at &#346;r&#299; Advaita Prabhu's house for a few days, and knowing well that the Lord was leaving His hearth and home for good, &#346;r&#299; Advaita Prabhu sent His men to Navadv&#299;pa to bring mother &#346;ac&#299; to have a last meeting with her son. Some unscrupulous people say that Lord Caitanya met His wife also after taking <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> and offered her His wooden slipper for worship, but the authentic sources give no information about such a meeting. His mother met Him at the house of Advaita Prabhu, and when she saw her son in <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa,</span> she lamented. By way of compromise, she requested her son to make His headquarters in Pur&#299; so that she would easily be able to get information about Him. The Lord granted this last desire of His beloved mother. After this incident the Lord started for Pur&#299;, leaving all the residents of Navadv&#299;pa in an ocean of lamentation over His separation.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><JD:"Destination-14">The Lord visited many important places on the way to Pur&#299;. He visited the temple of Gop&#299;n&#257;thaj&#299;, who had stolen condensed milk for His devotee &#346;r&#299;la M&#257;dhavendra Pur&#299;. Since then Deity Gop&#299;n&#257;thaj&#299; is well known as K&#7779;&#299;ra-cor&#257;-gop&#299;n&#257;tha. The Lord relished this story with great pleasure. The propensity of stealing is there even in the absolute consciousness, but because this propensity is exhibited by the Absolute, it loses its perverted nature and thus becomes worshipable even by Lord Caitanya on the basis of the absolute consideration that the Lord and His stealing propensity are one and identical. This interesting story of Gop&#299;n&#257;thaj&#299; is vividly explained in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta</span> by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;ad&#257;sa Kavir&#257;ja Gosv&#257;m&#299;.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">After visiting the temple of K&#7779;&#299;ra-cor&#257;-gop&#299;n&#257;tha of Remu&#7751;&#257; at Balasore in Orissa, the Lord proceeded towards Pur&#299; and on the way visited the temple of S&#257;k&#7779;i-gop&#257;la, who appeared as a witness in the matter of two <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> devotees' family quarrel. The Lord heard the story of S&#257;k&#7779;i-gop&#257;la with great pleasure because He wanted to impress upon the atheists that the worshipable Deities in the temples approved by the great <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> are not idols, as alleged by men with a poor fund of knowledge. The Deity in the temple is the <span class="Italic">arc&#257;</span> incarnation of the Personality of Godhead, and thus the Deity is identical with the Lord in all respects. He responds to the proportion of the devotee's affection for Him. In the story of S&#257;k&#7779;i-gop&#257;la, in which there was a family misunderstanding by two devotees of the Lord, the Lord, in order to mitigate the turmoil as well as to show specific favor to His servitors, traveled from V&#7771;nd&#257;vana to Vidy&#257;nagara, a village in Orissa, in the form of His <span class="Italic">arc&#257;</span> incarnation. From there the Deity was brought to Cuttack, and thus the temple of S&#257;k&#7779;i-gop&#257;la is even today visited by thousands of pilgrims on the way to Jagann&#257;tha Pur&#299;. The Lord stayed overnight there and began to proceed toward Pur&#299;. On the way, His <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> rod was broken by Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu<I> </I>[<I>Cc. Madhya </I><a href="index7035.html?g=96363">1.97</a>]. The Lord became apparently angry with Him about this and went alone to Pur&#299;, leaving His companions behind<I> </I>[<I>Cc. Madhya </I><a href="index753f.html?g=96370">1.98</a>].</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><JD:"Destination-15">At Pur&#299;, when He entered the temple of Jagann&#257;tha, He became at once saturated with transcendental ecstasy and fell down on the floor of the temple unconscious. The custodians of the temple could not understand the transcendental feats of the Lord, but there was a great learned <span class="Italic">pa&#7751;&#7693;ita</span> named S&#257;rvabhauma Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya, who was present, and he could understand that the Lord's losing His consciousness upon entering the Jagann&#257;tha temple was not an ordinary thing. S&#257;rvabhauma Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya, who was the chief appointed <span class="Italic">pa&#7751;&#7693;ita</span> in the court of the King of Orissa, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Prat&#257;parudra, was attracted by the youthful luster of Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu and could understand that such a transcendental trance was only rarely exhibited and only then by the topmost devotees who are already on the transcendental plane in complete forgetfulness of material existence. Only a liberated soul could show such a transcendental feat, and the Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya, who was vastly learned, could understand this in the light of the transcendental literature with which he was familiar. He therefore asked the custodians of the temple not to disturb the unknown <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;.</span> He asked them to take the Lord to his home so He could be further observed in His unconscious state. The Lord was at once carried to the home of S&#257;rvabhauma Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya, who at that time had sufficient power of authority due to his being the <span class="Italic">sabh&#257;-pa&#7751;&#7693;ita,</span> or the state dean of faculty in Sanskrit literatures. The learned <span class="Italic">pa&#7751;&#7693;ita</span> wanted to scrutinizingly test the transcendental feats of Lord Caitanya because often unscrupulous devotees imitate physical feats in order to flaunt transcendental achievements just to attract innocent people and take advantage of them. A learned scholar like the Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya can detect such imposters, and when he finds them out he at once rejects them.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In the case of Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, the Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya tested all the symptoms in the light of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras.</span> He tested as a scientist, not as a foolish sentimentalist. He observed the movement of the stomach, the beating of the heart and the breathing of the nostrils. He also felt the pulse of the Lord and saw that all His bodily activities were in complete suspension. When he put a small cotton swab before the nostrils, he found that there was a slight breathing as the fine fibers of cotton moved slightly. Thus he came to know that the Lord's unconscious trance was genuine, and he began to treat Him in the prescribed fashion. But Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu could only be treated in a special way. He would respond only to the resounding of the holy names of the Lord by His devotees. This special treatment was unknown to S&#257;rvabhauma Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya because the Lord was still unknown to him. When the Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya saw Him for the first time in the temple, he simply took Him to be one of many pilgrims.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In the meantime the companions of the Lord, who reached the temple a little after Him, heard of the Lord's transcendental feats and of His being carried away by the Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya. The pilgrims at the temple were still gossiping about the incident. But by chance, one of these pilgrims had met Gop&#299;n&#257;tha &#256;c&#257;rya, who was known to Gad&#257;dhara Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita, and from him it was learned that the Lord was lying in an unconscious state at the residence of S&#257;rvabhauma Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya, who happened to be the brother-in-law of Gop&#299;n&#257;tha &#256;c&#257;rya. All the members of the party were introduced by Gad&#257;dhara Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita to Gop&#299;n&#257;tha &#256;c&#257;rya, who took them all to the house of Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya where the Lord was lying unconscious in a spiritual trance. All the members then chanted loudly the holy name of the Lord Hari as usual, and the Lord regained His consciousness. After this, Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya received all the members of the party, including Lord Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu, and asked them to become his guests of honor. The party, including the Lord, went for a bath in the sea, and the Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya arranged for their residence and meals at the house of K&#257;&#347;&#299; Mi&#347;ra. Gop&#299;n&#257;tha &#256;c&#257;rya, his brother-in-law, also assisted. There were some friendly talks about the Lord's divinity between the two brothers-in-law, and in this argument Gop&#299;n&#257;tha &#256;c&#257;rya, who knew the Lord before, now tried to establish the Lord as the Personality of Godhead, and the Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya tried to establish Him as one of the great devotees. Both of them argued from the angle of vision of authentic <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> and not on the strength of sentimental <span class="Italic">vox populi.</span> The incarnations of God are determined by authentic <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> and not by popular votes of foolish fanatics. Because Lord Caitanya was an incarnation of God in fact, foolish fanatics have proclaimed so many so-called incarnations of God in this age without referring to authentic scriptures. But S&#257;rvabhauma Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya or Gop&#299;n&#257;tha &#256;c&#257;rya did not indulge in such foolish sentimentalism; on the contrary, both of them tried to establish or reject His divinity on the strength of authentic <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras.</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Later it was disclosed that Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya also came from the Navadv&#299;pa area, and it was understood from him that N&#299;l&#257;mbara Cakravart&#299;, the maternal grandfather of Lord Caitanya, happened to be a class fellow of the father of S&#257;rvabhauma Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya. In that sense, the young <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> Lord Caitanya evoked paternal affection from Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya. Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya was the professor of many <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s</span> in the order of the &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya-samprad&#257;ya, and he himself also belonged to that cult. As such, the Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya desired that the young <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> Lord Caitanya also hear from him about the teachings of Ved&#257;nta.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Those who are followers of the &#346;a&#7749;kara cult are generally known as Ved&#257;ntists. This does not, however, mean that Ved&#257;nta is a monopoly study of the &#346;a&#7749;kara-samprad&#257;ya. Ved&#257;nta is studied by all the bona fide <span class="Italic">samprad&#257;yas,</span> but they have their own interpretations. But those in the &#346;a&#7749;kara-samprad&#257;ya are generally known to be ignorant of the knowledge of the Ved&#257;ntist Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas. For this reason the Bhaktivedanta title was first offered to the author by the Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><JD:"Destination-16">The Lord agreed to take lessons from Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya on the Ved&#257;nta, and they sat together in the temple of Lord Jagann&#257;tha. The Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya went on speaking continually for seven days, and the Lord heard him with all attention and did not interrupt. The Lord's silence raised some doubts in Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya's heart, and he asked the Lord how it was that He did not ask anything or comment on his explanations of Ved&#257;nta.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The Lord posed Himself before the Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya as a foolish student and pretended that He heard the Ved&#257;nta from him because the Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya felt that this was the duty of a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;.</span> But the Lord did not agree with his lectures. By this the Lord indicated that the so-called Ved&#257;ntists amongst the &#346;a&#7749;kara-samprad&#257;ya, or any other <span class="Italic">samprad&#257;ya</span> who do not follow the instructions of &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva, are mechanical students of the Ved&#257;nta. They are not fully aware of that great knowledge. The explanation of the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra</span> is given by the author himself in the text of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> One who has no knowledge of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> will hardly be able to know what the Ved&#257;nta says.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya, being a vastly learned man, could follow the Lord's sarcastic remarks on the popular Ved&#257;ntist. He therefore asked Him why He did not ask about any point which He could not follow. The Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya could understand the purpose of His dead silence for the days He heard him. This showed clearly that the Lord had something else in mind; thus the Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya requested Him to disclose His mind.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Upon this, the Lord spoke as follows: "My dear sir, I can understand the meaning of the <span class="Italic">s&#363;tras</span> like <span class="Italic">janm&#257;dy asya yata&#7717;</I> [SB </I><a href="index4dab.html?g=6120">1.1.1</a></I>]</I>, &#347;&#257;stra-yonitv&#257;t,</span> and <span class="Italic"><I>ath&#257;to brahma jij&ntilde;&#257;s&#257;</span></I> of the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra,</span> but when you explain them in your own way it becomes difficult for Me to follow them. The purpose of the <span class="Italic">s&#363;tras</span> is already explained in them, but your explanations are covering them with something else. You do not purposely take the direct meaning of the <span class="Italic">s&#363;tras</span> but indirectly give your own interpretations."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The Lord thus attacked all Ved&#257;ntists who interpret the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra</span> fashionably, according to their limited power of thinking, to serve their own purpose. Such indirect interpretations of the authentic literatures like the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra</span> are hereby condemned by the Lord.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The Lord continued: "&#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva has summarized the direct meanings of the <span class="Italic">mantras</span> in the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads</span> in the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra.</span> Unfortunately you do not take their direct meaning. You indirectly interpret them in a different way.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"The authority of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is unchallengeable and stands without any question of doubt. And whatever is stated in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> must be accepted completely, otherwise one challenges the authority of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"The conchshell and cow dung are bone and stool of two living beings. But because they have been recommended by the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> as pure, people accept them as such because of the authority of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span>"</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The idea is that one cannot set his imperfect reason above the authority of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> The orders of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> must be obeyed as they stand, without any mundane reasoning. The so-called followers of the Vedic injunctions make their own interpretations of the Vedic injunctions, and thus they establish different parties and sects of the Vedic religion. Lord Buddha directly denied the authority of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> and he established his own religion. Only for this reason, the Buddhist religion was not accepted by the strict followers of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> But those who are so-called followers of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are more harmful than the Buddhists. The Buddhists have the courage to deny the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> directly, but the so-called followers of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> have no courage to deny the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> although indirectly they disobey all the injunctions of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> Lord Caitanya condemned this.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The examples given by the Lord of the conchshell and the cow dung are very much appropriate in this connection. If one argues that since cow dung is pure, the stool of a learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> is still more pure, his argument will not be accepted. Cow dung is accepted, and the stool of a highly posted <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> is rejected. The Lord continued:</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"The Vedic injunctions are self-authorized, and if some mundane creature adjusts the interpretations of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> he defies their authority. It is foolish to think of oneself as more intelligent than &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva. He has already expressed himself in his <span class="Italic">s&#363;tras,</span> and there is no need of help from personalities of lesser importance. His work, the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra,</span> is as dazzling as the midday sun, and when someone tries to give his own interpretations on the self-effulgent sunlike <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra,</span> he attempts to cover this sun with the cloud of his imagination.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> are one and the same in purpose. They ascertain the Absolute Truth, which is greater than everything else. The Absolute Truth is ultimately realized as the Absolute Personality of Godhead with absolute controlling power. As such, the Absolute Personality of Godhead must be completely full of opulence, strength, fame, beauty, knowledge and renunciation. Yet the transcendental Personality of Godhead is astonishingly ascertained as impersonal.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"The impersonal description of the Absolute Truth in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is given to nullify the mundane conception of the absolute whole. Personal features of the Lord are completely different from all kinds of mundane features. The living entities are all individual persons, and they are all parts and parcels of the supreme whole. If the parts and parcels are individual persons, the source of their emanation must not be impersonal. He is the Supreme Person amongst all the relative persons.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> inform us that from Him [Brahman] everything emanates, and on Him everything rests. And after annihilation, everything merges in Him only. Therefore, He is the ultimate dative, causative and accommodating cause of all causes. And these causes cannot be attributed to an impersonal object.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> inform us that He alone became many, and when He so desires He glances over material nature. Before He glanced over material nature there was no material cosmic creation. Therefore, His glance is not material. Material mind or senses were unborn when the Lord glanced over material nature. Thus evidence in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> proves that beyond a doubt the Lord has transcendental eyes and a transcendental mind. They are not material. His impersonality therefore is a negation of His materiality, but not a denial of His transcendental personality.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"Brahman ultimately refers to the Personality of Godhead. Impersonal Brahman realization is just the negative conception of the mundane creations. Param&#257;tm&#257; is the localized aspect of Brahman within all kinds of material bodies. Ultimately the Supreme Brahman realization is the realization of the Personality of Godhead according to all evidence of the revealed scriptures. He is the ultimate source of <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-tattvas.</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"The <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> are also supplementary to the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> The Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras</span> are too difficult for an ordinary man. Women, <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> and the so-called twice-born higher castes are unable to penetrate into the sense of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> And thus the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> as well as the <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> are made easy to explain the truths of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> In his prayers before the boy &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Brahm&#257; said that there is no limit to the fortune of the residents of Vrajabh&#363;mi headed by &#346;r&#299; Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and Ya&#347;od&#257;may&#299; because the eternal Absolute Truth has become their intimate relative.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"The Vedic <span class="Italic">mantra</span> maintains that the Absolute Truth has no legs and no hands and yet goes faster than all and accepts everything that is offered to Him in devotion. The latter statements definitely suggest the personal features of the Lord, although His hands and legs are distinguished from mundane hands and legs or other senses.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"Brahman, therefore, is never impersonal, but when such <span class="Italic">mantras</span> are indirectly interpreted, it is wrongly thought that the Absolute Truth is impersonal. The Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead is full of all opulences, and therefore He has a transcendental form of full existence, knowledge and bliss. How then can one establish that the Absolute Truth is impersonal?</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"Brahman, being full of opulences, is understood to have manifold energies, and all these energies are classified under three headings under the authority of <span class="Italic">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> [6.7.60], which says that the transcendental energies of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u are primarily three. His spiritual energy and the energy of the living entities are classified as superior energy, whereas the material energy is an inferior one which is sprouted out of ignorance.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"The energy of the living entities is technically called <span class="Italic">k&#7779;etraj&ntilde;a</span> energy. This <span class="Italic">k&#7779;etraj&ntilde;a-&#347;akti,</span> although equal in quality with the Lord, becomes overpowered by material energy out of ignorance and thus suffers all sorts of material miseries. In other words, the living entities are located in the marginal energy between the superior (spiritual) and inferior (material) energies, and in proportion to the living being's contact with either the material or spiritual energies, the living entity is situated in proportionately higher and lower levels of existence.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"The Lord is beyond the inferior and marginal energies as above mentioned, and His spiritual energy is manifested in three different phases: as eternal existence, eternal bliss and eternal knowledge. As far as eternal existence is concerned, it is conducted by the <span class="Italic">sandhin&#299;</span> potency; similarly, bliss and knowledge are conducted by the <span class="Italic">hl&#257;dhin&#299;</span> and <span class="Italic">sa&#7745;vit</span> potencies respectively. As the supreme energetic Lord, He is the supreme controller of the spiritual, marginal and material energies. And all these different types of energies are connected with the Lord in eternal devotional service.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"The Supreme Personality of Godhead is thus enjoying in His transcendental eternal form. Is it not astounding that one dares to call the Supreme Lord nonenergetic? The Lord is the controller of all energies, and the living entities are parts and parcels of one of the energies. Therefore there is a gulf of difference between the Lord and the living entities. How then can one say that the Lord and the living entities are one and the same? In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> also the living entities are described as belonging to the superior energy of the Lord. According to the principles of intimate correlation between the energy and the energetic, both of them are nondifferent also. Therefore, the Lord and the living entities are nondifferent as the energy and the energetic.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and ego are all inferior energies of the Lord, but the living entities are different from all as superior energy. This is the version of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> [<a href="index7379.html?g=2496">7.4</a>].</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"The transcendental form of the Lord is eternally existent and full of transcendental bliss. How then can such a form be a product of the material mode of goodness? Anyone, therefore, who does not believe in the form of the Lord is certainly a faithless demon and as such is untouchable, a not to be seen <span class="Italic">persona non grata</span> fit to be punished by the Plutonic king.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"The Buddhists are called atheists because they have no respect for the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> but those who defy the Vedic conclusions, as above mentioned, under the pretense of being followers of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> are verily more dangerous than the Buddhists.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"&#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva very kindly compiled the Vedic knowledge in his <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra,</span> but if one hears the commentation of the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da school (as represented by the &#346;a&#7749;kara-samprad&#257;ya) certainly he will be misled on the path of spiritual realization.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"The theory of emanations is the beginning subject of the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra.</span> All the cosmic manifestations are emanations from the Absolute Personality of Godhead by His inconceivable different energies. The example of the touchstone is applicable to the theory of emanation. The touchstone can convert an unlimited quantity of iron into gold, and still the touchstone remains as it is. Similarly, the Supreme Lord can produce all manifested worlds by His inconceivable energies, and yet He is full and unchanged. He is <span class="Italic">p&#363;r&#7751;a</span> [complete], and although an unlimited number of <span class="Italic">p&#363;r&#7751;as</span> emanate from Him, He is still <span class="Italic">p&#363;r&#7751;a.</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"The theory of illusion of the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da school is advocated on the ground that the theory of emanation will cause a transformation of the Absolute Truth. If that is the case, Vy&#257;sadeva is wrong. To avoid this, they have skillfully brought in the theory of illusion. But the world or the cosmic creation is not false, as maintained by the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da school. It simply has no permanent existence. A nonpermanent thing cannot be called false altogether. But the conception that the material body is the self is certainly wrong.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"<span class="Italic">Pra&#7751;ava</span> [<span class="Italic">o&#7745;</span>], or the <span class="Italic">o&#7745;k&#257;ra</span> in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> is the primeval hymn. This transcendental sound is identical with the form of the Lord. All the Vedic hymns are based on this <span class="Italic">pra&#7751;ava o&#7745;k&#257;ra.</span> <span class="Italic">Tat tvam asi</span> is but a side word in the Vedic literatures, and therefore this word cannot be the primeval hymn of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> &#346;r&#299;p&#257;da &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya has given more stress on the side word <span class="Italic">tat tvam asi</span> than on the primeval principle <span class="Italic">o&#7745;k&#257;ra.</span>"</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The Lord thus spoke on the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra</span> and defied all the propaganda of the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da school.* The Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya tried to defend himself and his M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da school by jugglery of logic and grammar, but the Lord defeated him by His forceful arguments. He affirmed that we are all related with the Personality of Godhead eternally and that devotional service is our eternal function in exchanging the dealings of our relations. The result of such exchanges is to attain <span class="Italic">prem&#257;,</span> or love of Godhead. When love of Godhead is attained, love for all other beings automatically follows because the Lord is the sum total of all living beings.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The Lord said that but for these three items-namely, eternal relation with God, exchange of dealings with Him and the attainment of love for Him-all that is instructed in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is superfluous and concocted.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The Lord further added that the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da philosophy taught by &#346;r&#299;p&#257;da &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya is an imaginary explanation of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> but it had to be taught by him (&#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya) because he was ordered to teach it by the Personality of Godhead. In the <span class="Italic">Padma Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> it is stated that the Personality of Godhead ordered His Lordship &#346;iva to deviate the human race from Him (the Personality of Godhead). The Personality of Godhead was to be so covered so that people would be encouraged to generate more and more population. His Lordship &#346;iva said to Dev&#299;: "In the Kali-yuga, I shall preach the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da philosophy, which is nothing but clouded Buddhism, in the garb of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span>"</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">After hearing all these speeches of the Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, the Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya was struck with wonder and awe and regarded Him in dead silence. The Lord then encouraged him with assurance that there was no cause to wonder. "I say that <span class="Italic">devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead is the highest goal of human life.</span>" He then quoted a <span class="Italic">&#347;loka</span> from the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> and assured him that even the liberated souls who are absorbed in the spirit and spiritual realization also take to the devotional service of the Lord Hari because the Personality of Godhead has such transcendental qualities that He attracts the heart of the liberated soul too.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Then the Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya desired to listen to the explanation of the "<span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;r&#257;ma</span>" <span class="Italic">&#347;loka</span> from the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bh&#257;gavatam</span></B> (<a href="index093f.html?g=8124">1.7.10</a>). The Lord first of all asked Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya to explain it, and after that He would explain it. The Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya then explained the <span class="Italic">&#347;loka</span> in a scholarly way with special reference to logic. He explained the <span class="Italic">&#347;loka</span> in nine different ways chiefly based on logic because he was the most renowned scholar of logic of the time.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The Lord, after hearing the Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya, thanked him for the scholarly presentation of the <span class="Italic">&#347;loka,</span> and then, at the request of the Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya, the Lord explained the <span class="Italic">&#347;loka</span> in sixty-four different ways without touching the nine explanations given by the Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Thus after hearing the explanation of the <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;r&#257;ma &#347;loka</span> from the Lord, the Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya was convinced that such a scholarly presentation is impossible for an earthly creature.* Before this, &#346;r&#299; Gop&#299;n&#257;tha &#256;c&#257;rya had tried to convince him of the divinity of the Lord, but at the time he could not so accept Him. But the Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya was astounded by the Lord's exposition of the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra</span> and explanations of the <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;r&#257;ma &#347;loka,</span> and thus he began to think that he had committed a great offense at the lotus feet of the Lord by not recognizing Him to be K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself. He then surrendered unto Him, repenting for his past dealings with Him, and the Lord was kind enough to accept the Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya. Out of His causeless mercy, the Lord manifested before him first as four-handed N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a and then again as two-handed Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a with a flute in His hand.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya at once fell down at the lotus feet of the Lord and composed many suitable <span class="Italic">&#347;lokas</span> in praise of the Lord by His grace. He composed almost one hundred <span class="Italic">&#347;lokas</span> in praise of the Lord. The Lord then embraced him, and out of transcendental ecstasy the Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya lost consciousness of the physical state of life. Tears, trembling, throbbing of the heart, perspiration, emotional waves, dancing, singing, crying and all the eight symptoms of trance were manifested in the body of the Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya. &#346;r&#299; Gop&#299;n&#257;tha &#256;c&#257;rya became very glad and astonished by this marvelous conversion of his brother-in-law by the grace of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Out of the hundred celebrated <span class="Italic">&#347;lokas</span> composed by the Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya in praise of the Lord, the following two are most important, and these two <span class="Italic">&#347;lokas</span> explain the mission of the Lord in gist.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><B>1.</B> Let me surrender unto the Personality of Godhead who has appeared now as Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. He is the ocean of all mercy and has now come down to teach us material detachment, learning and devotional service to Himself.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><B>2.</B> Since pure devotional service of the Lord has been lost in the oblivion of time, the Lord has appeared to renovate the principles, and therefore I offer my obeisances unto His lotus feet.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The Lord explained the word <span class="Italic">mukti</span> to be equivalent to the word Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, or the Personality of Godhead. To attain <span class="Italic">mukti,</span> or liberation from the bondage of material existence, is to attain to the service of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><JD:"Destination-17">The Lord then proceeded towards South India for some time and converted all He met on the way to become devotees of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Such devotees also converted many others to the cult of devotional service, or to the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata-dharma</span> of the Lord, and thus He reached the bank of the God&#257;var&#299;, where He met &#346;r&#299;la R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya, the governor of Madras on behalf of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Prat&#257;parudra, the King of Orissa. His talks with R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya are very important for higher realization of transcendental knowledge, and the conversation itself forms a small booklet. We shall, however, give herewith a summary of the conversation.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">&#346;r&#299; R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya was a self-realized soul, although outwardly he belonged to a caste lower than the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> in social status. He was not in the renounced order of life, and besides that he was a high government servant in the state. Still, &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu accepted him as a liberated soul on the strength of the high order of his realization of transcendental knowledge. Similarly, the Lord accepted &#346;r&#299;la Harid&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura, a veteran devotee of the Lord coming from a Mohammedan family. And there are many other great devotees of the Lord who came from different communities, sects and castes. The Lord's only criterion was the standard of devotional service of the particular person. He was not concerned with the outward dress of a man; He was concerned only with the inner soul and its activities. Therefore all the missionary activities of the Lord are to be understood to be on the spiritual plane, and as such the cult of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, or the cult of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata-dharma,</span> has nothing to do with mundane affairs, sociology, politics, economic development or any such sphere of life. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the purely transcendental urge of the soul.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">When He met &#346;r&#299; R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya on the bank of the God&#257;var&#299;, the <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> followed by the Hindus was mentioned by the Lord. &#346;r&#299;la R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya said that by following the principles of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma,</span> the system of four castes and four orders of human life, everyone could realize Transcendence. In the opinion of the Lord, the system of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> is superficial only, and it has very little to do with the highest realization of spiritual values. The highest perfection of life is to get detached from the material attachment and proportionately realize the transcendental loving service of the Lord. The Personality of Godhead recognizes a living being who is progressing in that line. Devotional service, therefore, is the culmination of the culture of all knowledge. When &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appeared for the deliverance of all fallen souls, He advised the deliverance of all living entities as follows. The Supreme Absolute Personality of Godhead, from whom all living entities have emanated, must be worshiped by all their respective engagements, because everything that we see is also the expansion of His energy. That is the way of real perfection, and it is approved by all bona fide <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> past and present. The system of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</span> is more or less based on moral and ethical principles. There is very little realization of the Transcendence as such, and Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu rejected it as superficial and asked R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya to go further into the matter.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">&#346;r&#299; R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya then suggested renunciation of fruitive actions unto the Lord. The <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index0526.html?g=3228">9.27</a>) advises in this connection: "Whatever you do, whatever you eat and whatever you give, as well as whatever you perform in penance, offer to Me alone." This dedication on the part of the worker suggests that the Personality of Godhead is a step higher than the impersonal conception of the <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</span> system, but still the relation of the living being and the Lord is not distinct in that way. The Lord therefore rejected this proposition and asked R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya to go further.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">R&#257;ya then suggested renunciation of the <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> and acceptance of devotional service. The Lord did not approve of this suggestion also for the reason that all of a sudden one should not renounce his position, for that may not bring in the desired result.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">It was further suggested by R&#257;ya that attainment of spiritual realization freed from the material conception of life is the topmost achievement for a living being. The Lord rejected this suggestion also because on the plea of such spiritual realization much havoc has been wrought by unscrupulous persons; therefore all of a sudden this is not possible. <JD:"Destination-18">The R&#257;ya then suggested sincere association of self-realized souls and hearing submissively the transcendental message of the pastimes of the Personality of Godhead. This suggestion was welcomed by the Lord. This suggestion was made following in the footsteps of Brahm&#257;j&#299;, who said that the Personality of Godhead is known as <span class="Italic">ajita,</span> or the one who cannot be conquered or approached by anyone. But such <span class="Italic">ajita</span> also becomes <span class="Italic">jita</span> (conquered) by one method, which is very simple and easy. The simple method is that one has to give up the arrogant attitude of declaring oneself to be God Himself. One must be very meek and submissive and try to live peacefully by lending the ear to the speeches of the transcendentally self-realized soul who speaks on the message of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata-dharma,</span> or the religion of glorifying the Supreme Lord and His devotees. To glorify a great man is a natural instinct for living beings, but they have not learned to glorify the Lord. Perfection of life is attained simply by glorifying the Lord in association with a self-realized devotee of the Lord.* The self-realized devotee is he who surrenders unto the Lord fully and who does not have attachment for material prosperity. Material prosperity and sense enjoyment and their advancement are all activities of ignorance in human society. Peace and friendship are impossible for a society detached from the association of God and His devotees. It is imperative, therefore, that one sincerely seek the association of pure devotees and hear them patiently and submissively from any position of life. The position of a person in the higher or lower status of life does not hamper one in the path of self-realization. The only thing one has to do is to hear from a self-realized soul with a routine program. The teacher may also deliver lectures from the Vedic literatures, following in the footsteps of the bygone <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> who realized the Absolute Truth. Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu recommended this simple method of self-realization generally known as <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata-dharma.</span> <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the perfect guide for this purpose.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Above these topics discussed by the Lord and &#346;r&#299; R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya, there were still more elevated spiritual talks between the two great personalities, and we purposely withhold those topics for the present because one has to come to the spiritual plane before further talks with R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya can be heard. We have presented further talks of &#346;r&#299;la R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya with the Lord in another book (<span class="Italic">Teachings of Lord Caitanya</span>).</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">At the conclusion of this meeting, &#346;r&#299; R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya was advised by the Lord to retire from service and come to Pur&#299; so that they could live together and relish a transcendental relationship. Some time later, &#346;r&#299; R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya retired from the government service and took a pension from the King. He returned to his residence in Pur&#299;, where he was one of the most confidential devotees of the Lord. There was another gentleman at Pur&#299; of the name &#346;ikhi M&#257;hiti, who was also a confidant like R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya. The Lord used to hold confidential talks on spiritual values with three or four companions at Pur&#299;, and He passed eighteen years in that way in spiritual trance. His talks were recorded by His private secretary &#346;r&#299; D&#257;modara Gosv&#257;m&#299;, one of the four most intimate devotees.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The Lord extensively traveled all over the southern part of India. The great saint of Mah&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra known as Saint Tuk&#257;r&#257;ma was also initiated by the Lord. Saint Tuk&#257;r&#257;ma, after initiation by the Lord, overflooded the whole of the Mah&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra Province with the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> movement, and the transcendental flow is still rolling on in the southwestern part of the great Indian peninsula.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The Lord excavated from South India two very important old literatures, namely the <I>Brahm&#257;-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</I> and <span class="Italic">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-kar&#7751;&#257;m&#7771;ta,</span> and these two valuable books are authorized studies for the person in the devotional line. The Lord then returned to Pur&#299; after His South Indian tour.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">On His return to Pur&#299;, all the anxious devotees of the Lord got back their life, and the Lord remained there with continued pastimes of His transcendental realizations. The most important incident during that time was His granting audience to King Prat&#257;parudra. King Prat&#257;parudra was a great devotee of the Lord, and he considered himself to be one of the servants of the Lord entrusted with sweeping the temple. This submissive attitude of the King was very much appreciated by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. The King requested both Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya and R&#257;ya to arrange his meeting with the Lord. When, however, the Lord was petitioned by His two stalwart devotees, He flatly refused to grant the request, even though it was put forward by personal associates like R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya and S&#257;rvabhauma Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya. The Lord maintained that it is dangerous for a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> to be in intimate touch with worldly money-conscious men and with women. The Lord was an ideal <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;.</span> No woman could approach the Lord even to offer respects. Women's seats were accommodated far away from the Lord. As an ideal teacher and <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya,</span> He was very strict in the routine work of a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;.</span> Apart from being a divine incarnation, the Lord was an ideal character as a human being. His behavior with other persons was also above suspicion. In His dealing as <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya,</span> He was harder than the thunderbolt and softer than the rose. <JD:"Destination-19">One of His associates, Junior Harid&#257;sa, committed a great mistake by lustfully glancing at a young woman. The Lord as Supersoul could detect this lust in the mind of Junior Harid&#257;sa, who was at once banished from the Lord's association and was never accepted again, even though the Lord was implored to excuse Harid&#257;sa for the mistake. Junior Harid&#257;sa afterwards committed suicide due to being disassociated from the company of the Lord, and the news of suicide was duly related to the Lord. Even at that time the Lord was not forgetful of the offense, and He said that Harid&#257;sa had rightly met with the proper punishment.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">On the principles of the renounced order of life and discipline, the Lord knew no compromise, and therefore even though He knew that the King was a great devotee, He refused to see the King, only because the King was a dollar-and-cent man. By this example the Lord wanted to emphasize the proper behavior for a transcendentalist. A transcendentalist has nothing to do with women and money. He must always refrain from such intimate relations. The King was, however, favored by the Lord by the expert arrangement of the devotees. This means that the beloved devotee of the Lord can favor a neophyte more liberally than the Lord. Pure devotees, therefore, never commit an offense at the feet of another pure devotee. An offense at the lotus feet of the Lord is sometimes excused by the merciful Lord, but an offense at the feet of a devotee is very dangerous for one who actually wants to make progress in devotional service.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><JD:"Destination-20">As long as the Lord remained at Pur&#299;, thousands of His devotees used to come to see Him during the Ratha-y&#257;tr&#257; car festival of Lord Jagann&#257;tha. And during the car festival, the washing of the Gu&#7751;&#7693;ic&#257; temple under the direct supervision of the Lord was an important function. The Lord's congregational <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> movement at Pur&#299; was a unique exhibition for the mass of people. That is the way to turn the mass mind towards spiritual realization. The Lord inaugurated this system of mass <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana,</span> and leaders of all countries can take advantage of this spiritual movement in order to keep the mass of people in a pure state of peace and friendship with one another. This is now the demand of the present human society all over the world.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">After some time the Lord again started on His tour towards northern India, and He decided to visit V&#7771;nd&#257;vana and its neighboring places. He passed through the jungles of Jharikha&#7751;&#7693;a (Madhya Bh&#257;rata), and all the wild animals also joined His <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> movement. The wild tigers, elephants, bears and deer all together accompanied the Lord, and the Lord accompanied them in <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana.</span> By this He proved that by the propagation of the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> movement (congregational chanting and glorifying of the name of the Lord) even the wild animals can live in peace and friendship, and what to speak of men who are supposed to be civilized. No man in the world will refuse to join the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> movement. Nor is the Lord's <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> movement restricted to any caste, creed, color or species. Here is direct evidence of His great mission: He allowed even the wild animals to partake in His great movement.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">On His way back from V&#7771;nd&#257;vana He first came to Pray&#257;ga, where He met R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; along with his younger brother, Anupama. Then He came down to Benares. For two months, He instructed &#346;r&#299; San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299; in the transcendental science. The instruction to San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299; is in itself a long narration, and full presentation of the instruction will not be possible here. The main ideas are given as follows.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299; (formerly known as S&#257;kara Mallika) was in the cabinet service of the Bengal government under the regime of Nawab Hussain Shah. He decided to join with the Lord and thus retired from the service. On His way back from V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, when He reached V&#257;r&#257;&#7751;as&#299;, the Lord became the guest of &#346;r&#299; Tapana Mi&#347;ra and Candra&#347;ekhara, assisted by a Mah&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> At that time V&#257;r&#257;&#7751;as&#299; was headed by a great <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> of the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da school named &#346;r&#299;p&#257;da Prak&#257;&#347;&#257;nanda Sarasvat&#299;. When the Lord was at V&#257;r&#257;&#7751;as&#299;, the people in general became more attracted to Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu on account of His mass <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> movement. Wherever He visited, especially the Vi&#347;van&#257;tha temple, thousands of pilgrims would follow Him. Some were attracted by His bodily features, and others were attracted by His melodious songs glorifying the Lord.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s</span> designate themselves as N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. V&#257;r&#257;&#7751;as&#299; is still overflooded with many M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s.</span> Some people who saw the Lord in His <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> party considered Him to be actually N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, and this report reached the camp of the great <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> Prak&#257;&#347;&#257;nanda.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In India there is always a kind of spiritual rivalry between the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da and <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata</span> schools, and thus when the news of the Lord reached Prak&#257;&#347;&#257;nanda he knew that the Lord was a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;,</span> and therefore he minimized the value of the Lord before those who brought him the news. He deprecated the activities of the Lord because of His preaching the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> movement, which was in his opinion nothing but religious sentiment. Prak&#257;&#347;&#257;nanda was a profound student of the Ved&#257;nta, and he advised his followers to give attention to the Ved&#257;nta and not to indulge in <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana.</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">One devotee <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> who became a devotee of the Lord, did not like the criticism of Prak&#257;&#347;&#257;nanda, and he went to the Lord to express his regrets. He told the Lord that when he uttered the Lord's name before the <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> Prak&#257;&#347;&#257;nanda, the latter strongly criticized the Lord, although the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> heard Prak&#257;&#347;&#257;nanda uttering several times the name Caitanya. The <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> was astonished to see that the <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> Prak&#257;&#347;&#257;nanda could not vibrate the sound K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a even once, although he uttered the name Caitanya several times.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The Lord smilingly explained to the devotee <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> why the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; cannot utter the holy name of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. "The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s are offenders at the lotus feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, although they utter always <span class="Italic">brahma, &#257;tm&#257;,</span> or <span class="Italic">caitanya,</span> etc. And because they are offenders at the lotus feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, they are actually unable to utter the holy name of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The name K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and the Personality of Godhead K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a are identical. There is no difference in the absolute realm between the name, form or person of the Absolute Truth because in the absolute realm everything is transcendental bliss. There is no difference between the body and the soul for the Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Thus He is different from the living entity who is always different from his outward body. Because of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's transcendental position, it is very difficult for a layman to actually know the Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, His holy name and fame, etc. His name, fame, form and pastimes all are one and the same transcendental identity, and they are not knowable by the exercise of the material senses.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"The transcendental relationship of the pastimes of the Lord is the source of still more bliss than one can experience by realization of Brahman or by becoming one with the Supreme. Had it not been so, then those who are already situated in the transcendental bliss of Brahman would not have been attracted by the transcendental bliss of the pastimes of the Lord."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><JD:"Destination-21">After this, a great meeting was arranged by the devotees of the Lord in which all the <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s</span> were invited, including the Lord and Prak&#257;&#347;&#257;nanda Sarasvat&#299;. In this meeting both the scholars (the Lord and Prak&#257;&#347;&#257;nanda) had a long discourse on the spiritual values of the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> movement, and a summary is given below.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The great M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> Prak&#257;&#347;&#257;nanda inquired from the Lord as to the reason for His preferring the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> movement to the study of the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra.</span> Prak&#257;&#347;&#257;nanda said that it is the duty of a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> to read the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra.</span> What caused the Lord to indulge in <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana?</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">After this inquiry, the Lord submissively replied: "I have taken to the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> movement instead of the study of Ved&#257;nta because I am a great fool." The Lord thus represented Himself as one of the numberless fools of this age who are absolutely incapable of studying the Ved&#257;nta philosophy. The fools indulgence in the study of Ved&#257;nta has caused so much havoc in society. The Lord thus continued: "And because I am a great fool, My spiritual master forbade Me to play with Ved&#257;nta philosophy. He said that it is better that I chant the holy name of the Lord, for that would deliver Me from material bondage.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"In this age of Kali there is no other religion but the glorification of the Lord by utterance of His holy name, and that is the injunction of all the revealed scriptures. And My spiritual master has taught Me one <span class="Italic">&#347;loka</span> [from the <span class="Italic">B&#7771;han-n&#257;rad&#299;ya Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span>]:</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><I>harer n&#257;ma harer n&#257;ma harer n&#257;maiva kevalam kalau n&#257;sty eva n&#257;sty eva n&#257;sty eva gatir anyath&#257;.</I> [<I>Cc. Adi</I> </I><a href="indexd751.html?g=93741">17.21</a></I>]</I></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"So on the order of My spiritual master, I chant the holy name of Hari, and I am now mad after this holy name. Whenever I utter the holy name I forget Myself completely, and sometimes I laugh, cry and dance like a madman. I thought that I had actually gone mad by this process of chanting, and therefore I asked My spiritual master about it. He informed Me that this was the real effect of chanting the holy name, which produces a transcendental emotion that is a rare manifestation. It is the sign of love of God, which is the ultimate end of life. Love of God is transcendental to liberation [<span class="Italic">mukti</span>], and thus it is called the fifth stage of spiritual realization, above the stage of liberation. By chanting the holy name of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a one attains the stage of love of God, and it was good that fortunately I was favored with the blessing."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">On hearing this statement from the Lord, the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> asked the Lord what was the harm in studying the Ved&#257;nta along with chanting the holy name. Prak&#257;&#347;&#257;nanda Sarasvat&#299; knew well that the Lord was formerly known as Nim&#257;i Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita, a very learned scholar of Navadv&#299;pa, and His posing as a great fool was certainly to some purpose. Hearing this inquiry by the <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;,</span> the Lord smiled and said, "My dear sir, if you do not mind, I will answer your inquiry."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">All the <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s</span> there were very much pleased with the Lord for His honest dealings, and they unanimously replied that they would not be offended by whatever He replied. The Lord then spoke as follows:</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"<span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra</span> consists of transcendental words or sounds uttered by the transcendental Personality of Godhead. As such, in the Ved&#257;nta there cannot be any human deficiencies like mistake, illusion, cheating or inefficiency. The message of the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads</span> is expressed in the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra,</span> and what is said there directly is certainly glorified. Whatever interpretations have been given by &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya have no direct bearing on the <span class="Italic">s&#363;tra,</span> and therefore such commentation spoils everything.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"The word Brahman indicates the greatest of all, which is full with transcendental opulences, superior to all. Brahman is ultimately the Personality of Godhead, and He is covered by indirect interpretations and established as impersonal. Everything that is in the spiritual world is full of transcendental bliss, including the form, body, place and paraphernalia of the Lord. All are eternally cognizant and blissful. It is not the fault of the &#256;c&#257;rya &#346;a&#7749;kara that he has so interpreted Ved&#257;nta, but if someone accepts it, then certainly he is doomed. Anyone who accepts the transcendental body of the Personality of Godhead as something mundane certainly commits the greatest blasphemy."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The Lord thus spoke to the <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> almost in the same way that He spoke to the Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya of Pur&#299;, and by forceful arguments He nullified the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da interpretations of the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra.</span> All the <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s</span> there claimed that the Lord was the personified <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and the Personality of Godhead. All the <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s</span> were converted to the cult of <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> all of them accepted the holy name of the Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and they dined together with the Lord in the midst of them. After this conversion of the <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s,</span> the popularity of the Lord increased at V&#257;r&#257;&#7751;as&#299;, and thousands of people assembled to see the Lord in person. The Lord thus established the primary importance of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavata-dharma,</span> and He defeated all other systems of spiritual realization. Since then everyone at V&#257;r&#257;&#7751;as&#299; was overwhelmed with the transcendental <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> movement.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">While the Lord was camping at V&#257;r&#257;&#7751;as&#299;, San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299; also arrived after retiring from office. He was formerly one of the state ministers in the government of Bengal, then under the regime of Nawab Hussain Shah. He had some difficulty in getting relief from the state service, for the Nawab was reluctant to let him leave. Nonetheless he came to V&#257;r&#257;&#7751;as&#299;, and the Lord taught him the principles of devotional service. He taught him about the constitutional position of the living being, the cause of his bondage under material conditions, his eternal relation with the Personality of Godhead, the transcendental position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, His expansions in different plenary portions of incarnations, His control of different parts of the universe, the nature of His transcendental abode, devotional activities, their different stages of development, the rules and regulations for achieving the gradual stages of spiritual perfection, the symptoms of different incarnations in different ages, and how to detect them with reference to the context of revealed scriptures.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The Lord's teachings to San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299; form a big chapter in the text of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299; Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta,</span> and to explain the whole teachings in minute details will require a volume in itself. These are treated in detail in our book <span class="Italic">Teachings of Lord Caitanya.</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><JD:"Destination-22">At Mathur&#257;, the Lord visited all the important places; then He reached V&#7771;nd&#257;vana. Lord Caitanya appeared in the family of a high-caste <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> and over and above that as <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> He was the preceptor for all the <span class="Italic">var&#7751;as</span> and <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;ramas.</span> But He used to accept meals from all classes of Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas. At Mathur&#257; the Sano&#7693;iy&#257; <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are considered to be in the lower status of society, but the Lord accepted meals in the family of such a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> also because His host happened to be a disciple of the M&#257;dhavendra Pur&#299; family.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">At V&#7771;nd&#257;vana the Lord took bath in twenty-four important bathing places and gh&#257;&#7789;as. He traveled to all the twelve important <span class="Italic">vanas</span> (forests). In these forests all the cows and birds welcomed Him, as if He were their very old friend. The Lord also began to embrace all the trees of those forests, and by doing so He felt the symptoms of transcendental ecstasy. Sometimes He fell unconscious, but He was made to regain consciousness by the chanting of the holy name of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The transcendental symptoms that were visible on the body of the Lord during His travel within the forest of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana were all unique and inexplicable, and we have just given a synopsis only.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Some of the important places that were visited by the Lord in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana were K&#257;myavana, &#256;d&#299;&#347;vara, P&#257;vana-sarovara, Khadiravana, &#346;e&#7779;a&#347;&#257;y&#299;, Khela-t&#299;rtha, Bh&#257;&#7751;&#7693;&#299;ravana, Bhadravana, &#346;r&#299;vana, Lauhavana, Mah&#257;vana, Gokula, K&#257;liya-hrada, Dv&#257;da&#347;&#257;ditya, Ke&#347;&#299;-t&#299;rtha, etc. When He saw the place where the <span class="Italic">r&#257;sa</span> dance took place, He at once fell down in trance. As long as He remained at V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, He made His headquarters at Akr&#363;ra-gh&#257;&#7789;a.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><JD:"Destination-23">From V&#7771;nd&#257;vana His personal servitor K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;ad&#257;sa Vipra induced Him to go back to Pray&#257;ga to take bath during the M&#257;gha-mel&#257;. The Lord acceded to this proposal, and they started for Pray&#257;ga. On the way they met with some Pathans, amongst whom there was a learned Moulana. The Lord had some talks with the Moulana and his companions, and the Lord convinced the Moulana that in the Koran also there are descriptions of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata-dharma</span> and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. All the Pathans were converted to His cult of devotional service.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">When He returned to Pray&#257;ga, &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; and his youngest brother met Him near Bindu-m&#257;dhava temple. This time the Lord was welcomed by the people of Pray&#257;ga more respectfully. Vallabha Bha&#7789;&#7789;a, who resided on the other bank of Pray&#257;ga in the village of &#256;&#7693;&#257;ila, was to receive Him at his place. but while going there the Lord jumped in the River Yamun&#257;. With great difficulty He was picked up in an unconscious state. Finally He visited the headquarters of Vallabha Bha&#7789;&#7789;a. This Vallabha Bha&#7789;&#7789;a was one of His chief admirers, but later on he inaugurated his own party, the Vallabha-samprad&#257;ya.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">On the bank of the Da&#347;&#257;&#347;vamedha-gh&#257;&#7789;a at Pray&#257;ga for ten days continually the Lord instructed R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; in the science of devotional service to the Lord. He taught the Gosv&#257;m&#299; the divisions of the living creatures in the 8,400,000 species of life. Then He taught him about the human species. Out of them He discussed the followers of the Vedic principles, out of them the fruitive workers, out of them the empiric philosophers, and out of them the liberated souls. He said that there are only a few who are actually pure devotees of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">&#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; was the younger brother of San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299;, and when he retired from service he brought with him two boat fulls of gold coins. This means that he brought with him some hundreds of thousands of rupees accumulated by the labor of his service. And before leaving home for Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, he divided the wealth as follows: fifty percent for the service of the Lord and His devotees, twenty-five percent for relatives and twenty-five percent for his personal needs in case of emergency. In that way he set an example for all householders.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><JD:"Destination-24">The Lord taught the Gosv&#257;m&#299; about devotional service, comparing it to a creeper, and advised him to protect the <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> creeper most carefully against the mad elephant offense against the pure devotees. In addition, the creeper has to be protected from the desires of sense enjoyment, monistic liberation and perfection of the <span class="Italic">ha&#7789;ha-yoga</span> system. They are all detrimental on the path of devotional service. Similarly, violence against living beings, and desire for worldly gain, worldly reception and worldly fame are all detrimental to the progress of <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> or <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata-dharma.</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Pure devotional service must be freed from all desires for sense gratification, fruitive aspirations and culture of monistic knowledge. One must be freed from all kinds of designations, and when one is thus converted to transcendental purity, one can then serve the Lord by purified senses.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">As long as there is the desire to enjoy sensually or to become one with the Supreme or to possess the mystic powers, there is no question of attaining the stage of pure devotional service.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Devotional service is conducted under two categories, namely primary practice and spontaneous emotion. When one can rise to the platform of spontaneous emotion, he can make further progress by spiritual attachment, feeling, love, and many higher stages of devotional life for which there are no English words. We have tried to explain the science of devotional service in our book <span class="Italic">The Nectar of Devotion,</span> based on the authority of <span class="Italic">Bhakti-ras&#257;m&#7771;ta-sindhu</span> by &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299;.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Transcendental devotional service has five stages of reciprocation:</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><B>1.</B> The self-realization stage just after liberation from material bondage is called the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;nta,</span> or neutral stage.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><B>2.</B> After that, when there is development of transcendental knowledge of the Lord's internal opulences, the devotee engages himself in the <span class="Italic">d&#257;sya</span> stage.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><B>3.</B> By further development of the <span class="Italic">d&#257;sya</span> stage, a respectful fraternity with the Lord develops, and above that a feeling of friendship on equal terms becomes manifest. Both these stages are called <span class="Italic">s&#257;khya</span> stage, or devotional service in friendship.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><B>4.</B> Above this is the stage of paternal affection toward the Lord, and this is called the <span class="Italic">v&#257;tsalya</span> stage.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><B>5.</B> And above this is the stage of conjugal love, and this stage is called the highest stage of love of God, although there is no difference in quality in any of the above stages. The last stage of conjugal love of God is called the <span class="Italic">m&#257;dhurya</span> stage.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Thus He instructed R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; in devotional science and deputed him to V&#7771;nd&#257;vana to excavate the lost sites of the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. After this, the Lord returned to V&#257;r&#257;&#7751;as&#299; and delivered the <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s</span> and instructed the elder brother of R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299;. We have already discussed this.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The Lord left only eight <span class="Italic">&#347;lokas</span> of His instructions in writing, and they are known as the <span class="Italic">&#346;ik&#7779;&#257;&#7779;&#7789;aka.</span> All other literatures of His divine cult were extensively written by the Lord's principal followers, the six Gosv&#257;m&#299;s of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, and their followers. The cult of Caitanya philosophy is richer than any other, and it is admitted to be the living religion of the day with the potency for spreading as <span class="Italic">vi&#347;va-dharma,</span> or universal religion. We are glad that the matter has been taken up by some enthusiastic sages like Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; Gosv&#257;m&#299; Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and his disciples. We shall eagerly wait for the happy days of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata-dharma,</span> or <span class="Italic">prema-dharma,</span> inaugurated by the Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><JD:"Destination-25">The eight <span class="Italic">&#347;lokas</span> completed by the Lord are:</div>
<div class="Center"><B>1</B></div>
<div class="Italic">Glory to the &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a </I>sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</I>, which cleanses the heart of all the dust accumulated for years and extinguishes the fire of conditional life, of repeated birth and death. This <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> movement is the prime benediction for humanity at large because it spreads the rays of the benediction moon. It is the life of all transcendental knowledge. It increases the ocean of transcendental bliss, and it enables us to fully taste the nectar for which we are always anxious.</div>
<div class="Center"><B>2</B></div>
<div class="Italic">O my Lord, Your holy name alone can render all benediction to living beings, and thus You have hundreds and millions of names like K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and Govinda. In these transcendental names You have invested all Your transcendental energies. There are not even hard and fast rules for chanting these names. O my Lord, out of kindness You enable us to easily approach You by chanting Your holy names, but I am so unfortunate that I have no attraction for them.</div>
<div class="Center"><B>3</B></div>
<div class="Italic">One should chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking oneself lower than the straw in the street; one should be more tolerant than a tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige, and ready to offer all respect to others. In such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the Lord constantly.</div>
<div class="Center"><B>4</B></div>
<div class="Italic">O almighty Lord, I have no desire to accumulate wealth, nor do I desire beautiful women, nor do I want any number of followers. I only want Your causeless devotional service birth after birth.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">O my Lord, &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, son of Vasudeva, O all-pervading Personality of Godhead, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You. I meditate upon Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a because He is the Absolute Truth and the primeval cause of all causes of the creation, sustenance and destruction of the manifested universes. He is directly and indirectly conscious of all manifestations, and He is independent because there is no other cause beyond Him. It is He only who first imparted the Vedic knowledge unto the heart of Brahm&#257;j&#299;, the original living being. By Him even the great sages and demigods are placed into illusion, as one is bewildered by the illusory representations of water seen in fire, or land seen on water. Only because of Him do the material universes, temporarily manifested by the reactions of the three modes of nature, appear factual, although they are unreal. I therefore meditate upon Him, Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who is eternally existent in the transcendental abode, which is forever free from the illusory representations of the material world. I meditate upon Him, for He is the Absolute Truth.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Obeisances unto the Personality of Godhead, V&#257;sudeva, directly indicate Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who is the divine son of Vasudeva and Devak&#299;. This fact will be more explicitly explained in the text of this work. &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva asserts herein that &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the original Personality of Godhead, and all others are His direct or indirect plenary portions or portions of the portion. &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; has even more explicitly explained the subject matter in his <span class="Italic">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-sandarbha.</span> And Brahm&#257;, the original living being, has explained the subject of &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a substantially in his treatise named <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;.</span> In the <span class="Italic">S&#257;ma-veda Upani&#7779;ad,</span> it is also stated that Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the divine son of Devak&#299;. Therefore, in this prayer, the first proposition holds that Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the primeval Lord, and if any transcendental nomenclature is to be understood as belonging to the Absolute Personality of Godhead, it must be the name indicated by the word K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, which means the all-attractive. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> in many places, the Lord asserts Himself to be the original Personality of Godhead, and this is confirmed by Arjuna, and also by great sages like N&#257;rada, Vy&#257;sa, and many others. In the <span class="Italic">Padma Pur&#257;&#7751;a,</span> it is also stated that out of the innumerable names of the Lord, the name of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the principal one. V&#257;sudeva indicates the plenary portion of the Personality of Godhead, and all the different forms of the Lord, being identical with V&#257;sudeva, are indicated in this text. The name V&#257;sudeva particularly indicates the divine son of Vasudeva and Devak&#299;. &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is always meditated upon by the <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sas,</span> who are the perfected ones among those in the renounced order of life.</div>
<div class="Purport">V&#257;sudeva, or Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, is the cause of all causes. Everything that exists emanates from the Lord. How this is so is explained in later chapters of this work. This work is described by Mah&#257;prabhu &#346;r&#299; Caitanya as the spotless <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> because it contains the transcendental narration of the Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The history of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is also very glorious. It was compiled by &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva after he had attained maturity in transcendental knowledge. He wrote this under the instructions of &#346;r&#299; N&#257;radaj&#299;, his spiritual master. Vy&#257;sadeva compiled all Vedic literatures, containing the four divisions of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tras</span> (or the <span class="Italic">Brahma-s&#363;tras</span>), the <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as,</span> the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata,</span> and so on. But nevertheless he was not satisfied. His dissatisfaction was observed by his spiritual master, and thus N&#257;rada advised him to write on the transcendental activities of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. These transcendental activities are described specifically in the Tenth Canto of this work. But, in order to reach to the very substance, one must proceed gradually by developing knowledge of the categories.</div>
<div class="Purport">It is natural that a philosophical mind wants to know about the origin of the creation. At night he sees the stars in the sky, and he naturally speculates about their inhabitants. Such inquiries are natural for man because man has a developed consciousness which is higher than that of the animals. The author of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> gives a direct answer to such inquiries. He says that the Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the origin of all creations. He is not only the creator of the universe, but the destroyer as well. The manifested cosmic nature is created at a certain period by the will of the Lord. It is maintained for some time, and then it is annihilated by His will. Therefore, the supreme will is behind all cosmic activities. Of course, there are atheists of various categories who do not believe in a creator, but that is due to a poor fund of knowledge. The modern scientist, for example, has created space satellites, and by some arrangement or other, these satellites are thrown into outer space to fly for some time at the control of the scientist who is far away. Similarly, all the universes with innumerable stars and planets are controlled by the intelligence of the Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purport"><JD:"Destination-27">In Vedic literatures, it is said that the Absolute Truth, Personality of Godhead, is the chief amongst all living personalities. All living beings, beginning from the first created being, Brahm&#257;, down to the smallest ant, are individual living beings. And above Brahm&#257;, there are even other living beings with individual capacities, and the Personality of Godhead is also a similar living being. And He is an individual as are the other living beings. But the Supreme Lord, or the supreme living being, has the greatest intelligence, and He possesses supermost inconceivable energies of all different varieties. If a man's brain can produce a space satellite, one can very easily imagine how brains higher than man can produce similarly wonderful things which are far superior. The reasonable person will easily accept this argument, but there are stubborn atheists who would never agree. &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva, however, at once accepts the supreme intelligence as the <span class="Italic">parame&#347;vara.</span> He offers his respectful obeisances unto the supreme intelligence addressed as the <span class="Italic">para</span> or the <span class="Italic">parame&#347;vara</span> or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And that <span class="Italic">parame&#347;vara</span> is &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, as admitted in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and other scriptures delivered by &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva and specifically in this <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> the Lord says that there is no other <span class="Italic">para-tattva</span> (<span class="Italic">summum bonum</span>) than Himself. Therefore, &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva at once worships the <span class="Italic">para-tattva,</span> &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, whose transcendental activities are described in the Tenth Canto.</div>
<div class="Purport"><JD:"Destination-28">Unscrupulous persons go immediately to the Tenth Canto and especially to the five chapters which describe the Lord's <span class="Italic">r&#257;sa</span> dance. This portion of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the most confidential part of this great literature. Unless one is thoroughly accomplished in the transcendental knowledge of the Lord, one is sure to misunderstand the Lord's worshipable transcendental pastimes called <span class="Italic">r&#257;sa</span> dance and His love affairs with the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s.</span> This subject matter is highly spiritual, and only the liberated persons who have gradually attained to the stage of <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa</span> can transcendentally relish this <span class="Italic">r&#257;sa</span> dance. &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva therefore gives the reader the chance to gradually develop spiritual realization before actually relishing the essence of the pastimes of the Lord. Therefore, he purposely invokes a G&#257;yatr&#299; <span class="Italic">mantra, dh&#299;mahi.</span> This G&#257;yatr&#299; <span class="Italic">mantra</span> is meant for spiritually advanced people. When one is successful in chanting the G&#257;yatr&#299; <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> he can enter into the transcendental position of the Lord. One must therefore acquire brahminical qualities or be perfectly situated in the quality of goodness in order to chant the G&#257;yatr&#299; <span class="Italic">mantra</span> successfully and then attain to the stage of transcendentally realizing the Lord, His name, His fame, His qualities and so on.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the narration of the <span class="Italic">svar&#363;pa</span> of the Lord manifested by His internal potency, and this potency is distinguished from the external potency which has manifested the cosmic world, which is within our experience. &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva makes a clear distinction between the two in this <span class="Italic">&#347;loka.</span> &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva says herein that the manifested internal potency is real, whereas the external manifested energy in the form of material existence is only temporary and illusory like the mirage in the desert. In the desert mirage there is no actual water. There is only the appearance of water. Real water is somewhere else. The manifested cosmic creation appears as reality. But reality, of which this is but a shadow, is in the spiritual world. Absolute Truth is in the spiritual sky, not the material sky. In the material sky everything is relative truth. That is to say, one truth depends on something else. This cosmic creation results from interaction of the three modes of nature, and the temporary manifestations are so created as to present an illusion of reality to the bewildered mind of the conditioned soul, who appears in so many species of life, including the higher demigods, like Brahm&#257;, Indra, Candra, and so on. In actuality, there is no reality in the manifested world. There appears to be reality, however, because of the true reality which exists in the spiritual world, where the Personality of Godhead eternally exists with His transcendental paraphernalia.</div>
<div class="Purport">The chief engineer of a complicated construction does not personally take part in the construction, but he knows every nook and corner because everything is done under his direction. He knows everything about the construction, both directly and indirectly. Similarly, the Personality of Godhead, who is the supreme engineer of this cosmic creation, knows every nook and corner, although affairs are being carried out by demigods. Beginning from Brahm&#257; down to the insignificant ant, no one is independent in the material creation. The hand of the Lord is seen everywhere. All material elements as well as all spiritual sparks emanate from Him only. And whatever is created in this material world is but the interaction of two energies, the material and the spiritual, which emanate from the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. A chemist can manufacture water in the chemical laboratory by mixing hydrogen and oxygen. But, in reality, the living entity works in the laboratory under the direction of the Supreme Lord. And the materials with which he works are also supplied by the Lord. The Lord knows everything directly and indirectly, and He is cognizant of all minute details, and He is fully independent. He is compared to a mine of gold, and the cosmic creations in so many different forms are compared to objects made from the gold, such as gold rings, necklaces and so on. The gold ring and the gold necklace are qualitatively one with the gold in the mine, but quantitatively the gold in the mine is different. Therefore, the Absolute Truth is simultaneously one and different. Nothing is absolutely equal with the Absolute Truth, but at the same time, nothing is independent of the Absolute Truth.</div>
<div class="Purport">Conditioned souls, beginning from Brahm&#257;, who engineers the entire universe, down to the insignificant ant, are all creating, but none of them are independent of the Supreme Lord. The materialist wrongly thinks that there is no creator other than his own self. This is called <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> or illusion. Because of his poor fund of knowledge, the materialist cannot see beyond the purview of his imperfect senses, and thus he thinks that matter automatically takes its own shape without the aid of a superior intelligence. This is refuted in this <span class="Italic">&#347;loka</span> by &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva: "Since the complete whole or the Absolute Truth is the source of everything, nothing can be independent of the body of the Absolute Truth." Whatever happens to the body quickly becomes known to the embodied. Similarly, the creation is the body of the absolute whole. Therefore, the Absolute knows everything directly and indirectly that happens in the creation.</div>
<div class="Purport">In the <span class="Italic">&#347;ruti-mantra,</span> it is also stated that the absolute whole or Brahman is the ultimate source of everything. Everything emanates from Him, and everything is maintained by Him. And at the end, everything enters into Him. That is the law of nature. In the <span class="Italic">sm&#7771;ti-mantra,</span> the same is confirmed. It is said that the source from which everything emanates at the beginning of Brahm&#257;'s millennium and the reservoir to which everything ultimately enters, is the Absolute Truth or Brahman. Material scientists take it for granted that the ultimate source of the planetary system is the sun, but they are unable to explain the source of the sun. Herein, the ultimate source is explained. According to the Vedic literatures, Brahm&#257;, who may be compared to the sun, is not the ultimate creator. It is stated in this <span class="Italic">&#347;loka</span> that Brahm&#257; was taught Vedic knowledge by the Personality of Godhead. One may argue that Brahm&#257;, being the original living being, could not be inspired because there was no other being living at that time. Herein it is stated that the Supreme Lord inspired the secondary creator, Brahm&#257;, in order that Brahm&#257; could carry out his creative functions. So, the supreme intelligence behind all creations is the Absolute Godhead, &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a states that it is He only who superintends the creative energy, <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti,</span> which constitutes the totality of matter. Therefore, &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva does not worship Brahm&#257;, but the Supreme Lord, who guides Brahm&#257; in his creative activities. In this <span class="Italic">&#347;loka,</span> the particular words <span class="Italic">abhij&ntilde;a&#7717;</span> and <span class="Italic">svar&#257;&#7789;</span> are significant. These two words distinguish the Supreme Lord from all the other living entities. No other living entity is either <span class="Italic">abhij&ntilde;a&#7717;</span> or <span class="Italic">svar&#257;&#7789;.</span> That is, no one is either fully cognizant or fully independent. Even Brahm&#257; has to meditate upon the Supreme Lord in order to create. Then what to speak of great scientists like Einstein! The brains of such a scientist are certainly not the products of any human being. Scientists cannot manufacture such a brain, and what to speak of foolish atheists who defy the authority of the Lord? Even M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; impersonalists who flatter themselves that they can become one with the Lord are neither <span class="Italic">abhij&ntilde;a&#7717;</span> or <span class="Italic">svar&#257;&#7789;.</span> Such impersonalists undergo severe austerities to acquire knowledge to become one with the Lord. But ultimately they become dependent on some rich disciple who supplies them with money to build monasteries and temples. Atheists like R&#257;va&#7751;a or Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu had to undergo severe penances before they could flout the authority of the Lord. But ultimately, they were rendered helpless and could not save themselves when the Lord appeared before them as cruel death. This is also the case with the modern atheists who also dare to flout the authority of the Lord. Such atheists will be dealt with similarly, for history repeats itself. Whenever men neglect the authority of the Lord, nature and her laws are there to penalize them. This is confirmed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> in the well-known verse <span class="Italic">yad&#257; yad&#257; hi dharmasya gl&#257;ni&#7717;.</span> "Whenever there is a decline of <span class="Italic">dharma</span> and a rise of <span class="Italic">adharma,</span> O Arjuna, then I incarnate Myself." (Bg. <a href="indexd622.html?g=1487">4.7</a>)</div>
<div class="Purport">That the Supreme Lord is all-perfect is confirmed in all <span class="Italic">&#347;ruti-mantras.</span> It is said in the <span class="Italic">&#347;ruti-mantras</span> that the all-perfect Lord threw a glance over matter and thus created all living beings. The living beings are parts and parcels of the Lord, and He impregnates the vast material creation with seeds of spiritual sparks, and thus the creative energies are set in motion to enact so many wonderful creations. An atheist may argue that God is no more expert than a watchmaker, but of course God is greater because He can create machines in duplicate male and female forms. The male and female forms of different types of machineries go on producing innumerable similar machines without God's further attention. If a man could manufacture such a set of machines that could produce other machines without his attention, then he could approach the intelligence of God. But that is not possible, for each machine has to be handled individually. Therefore, no one can create as well as God. Another name for God is <span class="Italic">asamaurdhva,</span> which means that no one is equal to or greater than Him. <span class="Italic">Para&#7745; satyam,</span> or the Supreme Truth, is He who has no equal or superior. This is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">&#347;ruti-mantras.</span> It is said that before the creation of the material universe there existed the Lord only, who is master of everyone. That Lord instructed Brahm&#257; in Vedic knowledge. That Lord has to be obeyed in all respects. Anyone who wants to get rid of the material entanglement must surrender unto Him. This is also confirmed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">Unless one surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, it is certain that he will be bewildered. When an intelligent man surrenders unto the lotus feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and knows completely that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the cause of all causes, as confirmed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> then only can such an intelligent man become a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;,</span> or great soul. But such a great soul is rarely seen. Only the <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;s</span> can understand that the Supreme Lord is the primeval cause of all creations. He is <span class="Italic">parama</span> or ultimate truth because all other truths are relative to Him. He is omniscient. For Him, there is no illusion.</div>
<div class="Purport">Some M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; scholars argue that <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> was not compiled by &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva. And some of them suggest that this book is a modern creation written by someone named Vopadeva. In order to refute such meaningless arguments, &#346;r&#299; &#346;r&#299;dhara Sv&#257;m&#299; points out that there is reference to the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> in many of the oldest <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as.</span> This first <span class="Italic">&#347;loka</span> of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> begins with the G&#257;yatr&#299; <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> There is reference to this in the <span class="Italic">Matsya Pur&#257;&#7751;a,</span> which is the oldest <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;a.</span> In that <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;a,</span> it is said with reference to the G&#257;yatr&#299; <span class="Italic">mantra</span> in the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> that there are many narrations of spiritual instructions beginning with the G&#257;yatr&#299; <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> And there is the history of V&#7771;tr&#257;sura. Anyone who makes a gift of this great work on a full moon day attains to the highest perfection of life by returning to Godhead. There is reference to the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> in other <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> also, where it is clearly stated that this work was finished in twelve cantos, which include eighteen thousand <span class="Italic">&#347;lokas.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Padma Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> also there is reference to the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> in a conversation between Gautama and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ambar&#299;&#7779;a. The king was advised therein to read regularly <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> if he desired liberation from material bondage. Under the circumstances, there is no doubt about the authority of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> Within the past five hundred years, many erudite scholars and <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> like J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;, San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299;, Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299;, Vallabh&#257;c&#257;rya, and many other distinguished scholars even after the time of Lord Caitanya made elaborate commentaries on the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> And the serious student would do well to attempt to go through them to better relish the transcendental messages.</div>
<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura specifically deals with the original and pure sex psychology (<span class="Italic">&#257;di-rasa</span>), devoid of all mundane inebriety. <span class="Italic">The whole material creation is moving under the principle of sex life.</span> In modern civilization, sex life is the focal point for all activities. Wherever one turns his face, he sees sex life predominant. Therefore, sex life is not unreal. Its reality is experienced in the spiritual world. The material sex life is but a perverted reflection of the original fact. The original fact is in the Absolute Truth, and thus the Absolute Truth cannot be impersonal. It is not possible to be impersonal and contain pure sex life. Consequently, the impersonalist philosophers have given indirect impetus to the abominable mundane sex life because they have overstressed the impersonality of the ultimate truth. Consequently, man without information of the actual spiritual form of sex has accepted perverted material sex life as the all in all. There is a distinction between sex life in the diseased material condition and spiritual sex life.</div>
<div class="Purport">This <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> will gradually elevate the unbiased reader to the highest perfectional stage of transcendence. It will enable him to transcend the three modes of material activities: fruitive actions, speculative philosophy, and worship of functional deities as inculcated in Vedic verses.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Completely rejecting all religious activities which are materially motivated, this Bh&#257;gavata Pur&#257;&#7751;a propounds the highest truth, which is understandable by those devotees who are fully pure in heart. The highest truth is reality distinguished from illusion for the welfare of all. Such truth uproots the threefold miseries. This beautiful Bh&#257;gavatam, compiled by the great sage Vy&#257;sadeva [in his maturity], is sufficient in itself for God realization. What is the need of any other scripture? As soon as one attentively and submissively hears the message of Bh&#257;gavatam, by this culture of knowledge the Supreme Lord is established within his heart.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Religion includes four primary subjects, namely pious activities, economic development, satisfaction of the senses, and finally liberation from material bondage. Irreligious life is a barbarous condition. Indeed, human life begins when religion begins. Eating, sleeping, fearing, and mating are the four principles of animal life. These are common both to animals and to human beings. But religion is the extra function of the human being. Without religion, human life is no better than animal life. Therefore, in human societies there is some form of religion which aims at self-realization and which makes reference to man's eternal relationship with God.</div>
<div class="Purport">In the lower stages of human civilization, there is always competition to lord it over the material nature or, in other words, there is a continuous rivalry to satisfy the senses. Driven by such consciousness, man turns to religion. He thus performs pious activities or religious functions in order to gain something material. But if such material gains are obtainable in other ways, then so-called religion is neglected. This is the situation in modern civilization. Man is thriving economically, so at present he is not very interested in religion. Churches, mosques or temples are now practically vacant. Men are more interested in factories, shops, and cinemas than in religious places which were erected by their forefathers. This practically proves that religion is performed for some economic gains. Economic gains are needed for sense gratification. Often when one is baffled in the pursuit of sense gratification, he takes to salvation and tries to become one with the Supreme Lord. Consequently, all these states are simply different types of sense gratification.</div>
<div class="Purport">In the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> the above-mentioned four activities are prescribed in the regulative way so that there will not be any undue competition for sense gratification. But <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is transcendental to all these sense gratificatory activities. It is purely transcendental literature which can be understood only by the pure devotees of the Lord who are transcendental to competitive sense gratification. In the material world there is keen competition between animal and animal, man and man, community and community, nation and nation. But the devotees of the Lord rise above such competitions. They do not compete with the materialist because they are on the path back to Godhead where life is eternal and blissful. Such transcendentalists are nonenvious and pure in heart. In the material world, everyone is envious of everyone else, and therefore there is competition. But the transcendental devotees of the Lord are not only free from material envy, but are well-wishers to everyone, and they strive to establish a competitionless society with God in the center. The contemporary socialist's conception of a competitionless society is artificial because in the socialist state there is competition for the post of dictator. From the point of view of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> or from the point of view of common human activities, sense gratification is the basis of material life. There are three paths mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> One involves fruitive activities to gain promotion to better planets. Another involves worshiping different demigods for promotion to the planets of the demigods, and another involves realizing the Absolute Truth and His impersonal feature and becoming one with Him.</div>
<div class="Purport"><JD:"Destination-29">The impersonal aspect of the Absolute Truth is not the highest. Above the impersonal feature is the Param&#257;tm&#257; feature, and above this is the personal feature of the Absolute Truth, or Bhagav&#257;n. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> gives information about the Absolute Truth in His personal feature. It is higher than impersonalist literatures and higher than the <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</span> division of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> It is even higher than the <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</span> division, and even higher than the <span class="Italic">up&#257;san&#257;-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</span> division, because it recommends the worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. In the <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a,</span> there is competition to reach heavenly planets for better sense gratification, and there is similar competition in the <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</span> and the <span class="Italic">up&#257;san&#257;-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a.</span> The <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is superior to all of these because it aims at the Supreme Truth which is the substance or the root of all categories. From <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> one can come to know the substance as well as the categories. The substance is the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Lord, and all emanations are relative forms of energy.</div>
<div class="Purport">Nothing is apart from the substance, but at the same time the energies are different from the substance. This conception is not contradictory. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> explicitly promulgates this simultaneously one and different philosophy of the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra,</span> which begins with the "<span class="Italic">janm&#257;dy asya</span>"<span class="Italic"></I> [SB </I><a href="index4dab.html?g=6120">1.1.1</a></I>]</span></I> <span class="Italic">s&#363;tra.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">This knowledge that the energy of the Lord is simultaneously one with and different from the Lord is an answer to the mental speculators' attempt to establish the energy as the Absolute. When this knowledge is factually understood, one sees the conceptions of monism and dualism to be imperfect. Development of this transcendental consciousness grounded in the conception of simultaneously one and different leads one immediately to the stage of freedom from the threefold miseries. The threefold miseries are (<B>1</B>) those miseries which arise from the mind and body, (<B>2</B>) those miseries inflicted by other living beings, and (<B>3</B>) those miseries arising from natural catastrophes over which one has no control. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> begins with the surrender of the devotee unto the Absolute Person. The devotee is fully aware that he is one with the Absolute and at the same time in the eternal position of servant to the Absolute. In the material conception, one falsely thinks himself the lord of all he surveys, and therefore he is always troubled by the threefold miseries of life. But as soon as one comes to know his real position as transcendental servant, he at once becomes free from all miseries. As long as the living entity is trying to master material nature, there is no possibility of his becoming servant of the Supreme. Service to the Lord is rendered in pure consciousness of one's spiritual identity; by service one is immediately freed from material encumbrances.</div>
<div class="Purport">Over and above this, <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is a personal commentation on the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra</span> by &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva. It was written in the maturity of his spiritual life through the mercy of N&#257;rada. &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva is the authorized incarnation of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, the Personality of Godhead. Therefore, there is no question as to his authority. He is the author of all other Vedic literatures, yet he recommends the study of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> above all others. In other <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> there are different methods set forth by which one can worship the demigods. But in the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> only the Supreme Lord is mentioned. The Supreme Lord is the total body, and the demigods are the different parts of that body. Consequently, by worshiping the Supreme Lord, one does not need to worship the demigods. The Supreme Lord becomes fixed in the heart of the devotee immediately. Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu has recommended the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> as the spotless <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> and distinguishes it from all other <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">The proper method for receiving this transcendental message is to hear it submissively. A challenging attitude cannot help one realize this transcendental message. One particular word is used herein for proper guidance. This word is <span class="Italic">&#347;u&#347;r&#363;&#7779;u.</span> One must be anxious to hear this transcendental message. The desire to sincerely hear is the first qualification.</div>
<div class="Purport">Less fortunate persons are not at all interested in hearing this <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> The process is simple, but the application is difficult. Unfortunate people find enough time to hear idle social and political conversations, but when invited to attend a meeting of devotees to hear <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> they suddenly become reluctant. Sometimes professional readers of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> immediately plunge into the confidential topics of the pastimes of the Supreme Lord, which they seemingly interpret as sex literature. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is meant to be heard from the beginning. Those who are fit to assimilate this work are mentioned in this <span class="Italic">&#347;loka:</span> "One becomes qualified to hear <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> after many pious deeds." The intelligent person, with thoughtful discretion, can be assured by the great sage Vy&#257;sadeva that he can realize the Supreme Personality directly by hearing <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> Without undergoing the different stages of realization set forth in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> one can be lifted immediately to the position of <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa</span> simply by agreeing to receive this message.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">O expert and thoughtful men, relish &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, the mature fruit of the desire tree of Vedic literatures. It emanated from the lips of &#346;r&#299; &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;. Therefore this fruit has become even more tasteful, although its nectarean juice was already relishable for all, including liberated souls.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the two previous <span class="Italic">&#347;lokas</span> it has been definitely proved that the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the sublime literature which surpasses all other Vedic scriptures due to its transcendental qualities. It is transcendental to all mundane activities and mundane knowledge. In this <span class="Italic">&#347;loka</span> it is stated that <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is not only a superior literature but is the ripened fruit of all Vedic literatures. In other words, it is the cream of all Vedic knowledge. Considering all this, patient and submissive hearing is definitely essential. With great respect and attention, one should receive the message and lessons imparted by the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are compared to the desire tree because they contain all things knowable by man. They deal with mundane necessities as well as spiritual realization. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> contain regulated principles of knowledge covering social, political, religious, economic, military, medicinal, chemical, physical and metaphysical subject matter and all that may be necessary to keep the body and soul together. Above and beyond all this are specific directions for spiritual realization. Regulated knowledge involves a gradual raising of the living entity to the spiritual platform, and the highest spiritual realization is knowledge that the Personality of Godhead is the reservoir of all spiritual tastes, or <span class="Italic">rasas.</span></div>
<div class="Purport"><JD:"Destination-30">Every living entity, beginning from Brahm&#257;, the first-born living being within the material world, down to the insignificant ant, desires to relish some sort of taste derived from sense perceptions. These sensual pleasures are technically called <span class="Italic">rasas.</span> Such <span class="Italic">rasas</span> are of different varieties. In the revealed scriptures the following twelve varieties of <span class="Italic">rasas</span> are enumerated: (<B>1</B>) <span class="Italic">raudra</span> (anger), (<B>2</B>) <span class="Italic">adbhuta</span> (wonder), (<B>3</B>) <span class="Italic">&#347;&#7771;&#7749;g&#257;ra</span> (conjugal love), (<B>4</B>) <span class="Italic">h&#257;sya</span> (comedy), (<B>5</B>) <span class="Italic">v&#299;ra</span> (chivalry), (<B>6</B>) <span class="Italic">day&#257;</span> (mercy), (<B>7</B>) <span class="Italic">d&#257;sya</span> (servitorship), (<B>8</B>) <span class="Italic">sakhya</span> (fraternity), (<B>9</B>) <span class="Italic">bhay&#257;naka</span> (horror), (<B>10</B>) <span class="Italic">b&#299;bhatsa</span> (shock), (<B>11</B>) <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;nta</span> (neutrality), (<B>12</B>) <span class="Italic">v&#257;tsalya</span> (parenthood).</div>
<div class="Purport">The sum total of all these <span class="Italic">rasas</span> is called affection or love. Primarily, such signs of love are manifested in adoration, service, friendship, paternal affection, and conjugal love. And when these five are absent, love is present indirectly in anger, wonder, comedy, chivalry, fear, shock and so on. For example, when a man is in love with a woman, the <span class="Italic">rasa</span> is called conjugal love. But when such love affairs are disturbed there may be wonder, anger, shock, or even horror. Sometimes love affairs between two persons culminate in ghastly murder scenes. Such <span class="Italic">rasas</span> are displayed between man and man and between animal and animal. There is no possibility of an exchange or <span class="Italic">rasa</span> between a man and an animal or between a man and any other species of living beings within the material world. The <span class="Italic">rasas</span> are exchanged between members of the same species. But as far as the spirit souls are concerned, they are one qualitatively with the Supreme Lord. Therefore, the <span class="Italic">rasas</span> were originally exchanged between the spiritual living being and the spiritual whole, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The spiritual exchange or <span class="Italic">rasa</span> is fully exhibited in spiritual existence between living beings and the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="Purport">The Supreme Personality of Godhead is therefore described in the <span class="Italic">&#347;ruti-mantras,</span> Vedic hymns, as "the fountainhead of all <span class="Italic">rasas.</span>" When one associates with the Supreme Lord and exchanges one's constitutional <span class="Italic">rasa</span> with the Lord, then the living being is actually happy.</div>
<div class="Purport">These <span class="Italic">&#347;ruti-mantras</span> indicate that every living being has its constitutional position, which is endowed with a particular type of <span class="Italic">rasa</span> to be exchanged with the Personality of Godhead. In the liberated condition only, this primary <span class="Italic">rasa</span> is experienced in full. In the material existence, the <span class="Italic">rasa</span> is experienced in the perverted form, which is temporary. And thus the <span class="Italic">rasas</span> of the material world are exhibited in the material form of <span class="Italic">raudra</span> (anger) and so on.</div>
<div class="Purport">Therefore, one who attains full knowledge of these different <span class="Italic">rasas,</span> which are the basic principles of activities, can understand the false representations of the original <span class="Italic">rasas</span> which are reflected in the material world. The learned scholar seeks to relish the real <span class="Italic">rasa</span> in the spiritual form. In the beginning he desires to become one with the Supreme. Thus, less intelligent transcendentalists cannot go beyond this conception of becoming one with the spirit whole, without knowing of the different <span class="Italic">rasas.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">In this <span class="Italic">&#347;loka,</span> it is definitely stated that spiritual <span class="Italic">rasa,</span> which is relished even in the liberated stage, can be experienced in the literature of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> due to its being the ripened fruit of all Vedic knowledge. By submissively hearing this transcendental literature, one can attain the full pleasure of his heart's desire. But one must be very careful to hear the message from the right source. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is exactly received from the right source. It was brought by N&#257;rada Muni from the spiritual world and given to his disciple &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva. The latter in turn delivered the message to his son &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, and &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; delivered the message to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it just seven days before the King's death. &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was a liberated soul from his very birth. He was liberated even in the womb of his mother, and he did not undergo any sort of spiritual training after his birth. At birth no one is qualified, neither in the mundane nor in the spiritual sense. But &#346;r&#299; &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, due to his being a perfectly liberated soul, did not have to undergo an evolutionary process for spiritual realization. Yet despite his being a completely liberated person situated in the transcendental position above the three material modes, he was attracted to this transcendental <span class="Italic">rasa</span> of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is adored by liberated souls who sing Vedic hymns. The Supreme Lord's pastimes are more attractive to liberated souls than to mundane people. He is of necessity not impersonal because it is only possible to carry on transcendental <span class="Italic">rasa</span> with a person.</div>
<div class="Purport">In the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> the transcendental pastimes of the Lord are narrated, and the narration is systematically depicted by &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;. Thus the subject matter is appealing to all classes of persons, including those who seek liberation and those who seek to become one with the supreme whole.</div>
<div class="Purport">In Sanskrit the parrot is also known as <span class="Italic">&#347;uka.</span> When a ripened fruit is cut by the red beaks of such birds, its sweet flavor is enhanced. The Vedic fruit which is mature and ripe in knowledge is spoken through the lips of &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, who is compared to the parrot not for his ability to recite the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> exactly as he heard it from his learned father, but for his ability to present the work in a manner that would appeal to all classes of men.</div>
<div class="Purport">The subject matter is so presented through the lips of &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; that any sincere listener that hears submissively can at once relish transcendental tastes which are distinct from the perverted tastes of the material world. The ripened fruit is not dropped all of a sudden from the highest planet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;aloka. Rather, it has come down carefully through the chain of disciplic succession without change or disturbance. Foolish people who are not in the transcendental disciplic succession commit great blunders by trying to understand the highest transcendental <span class="Italic">rasa</span> known as the <span class="Italic">r&#257;sa</span> dance without following in the footsteps of &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, who presents this fruit very carefully by stages of transcendental realization. One should be intelligent enough to know the position of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> by considering personalities like &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, who deals with the subject so carefully. This process of disciplic succession of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata</span> school suggests that in the future also <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> has to be understood from a person who is factually a representative of &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;. A professional man who makes a business out of reciting the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> illegally is certainly not a representative of &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;. Such a man's business is only to earn his livelihood. Therefore one should refrain from hearing the lectures of such professional men. Such men usually go to the most confidential part of the literature without undergoing the gradual process of understanding this grave subject. They usually plunge into the subject matter of the <span class="Italic">r&#257;sa</span> dance, which is misunderstood by the foolish class of men. Some of them take this to be immoral, while others try to cover it up by their own stupid interpretations. They have no desire to follow in the footsteps of &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;.</div>
<div class="Purport">One should conclude, therefore, that the serious student of the <span class="Italic">rasa</span> should receive the message of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> in the chain of disciplic succession from &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, who describes the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> from its very beginning and not whimsically to satisfy the mundaner who has very little knowledge in transcendental science. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is so carefully presented that a sincere and serious person can at once enjoy the ripened fruit of Vedic knowledge simply by drinking the nectarean juice through the mouth of &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; or his bona fide representative.</div>

<div class="Translation">Once, in a holy place in the forest of Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya, great sages headed by the sage &#346;aunaka assembled to perform a great thousand-year sacrifice for the satisfaction of the Lord and His devotees.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The prelude of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> was spoken in the previous three <span class="Italic">&#347;lokas.</span> Now the main topic of this great literature is being presented. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> after its first recitation by &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, was repeated for the second time at Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya.</div>
<div class="Purport">In the <span class="Italic">V&#257;yav&#299;ya Tantra,</span> it is said that Brahm&#257;, the engineer of this particular universe, contemplated a great wheel which could enclose the universe. The hub of this great circle was fixed at a particular place known as Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya. Similarly, there is another reference to the forest of Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya in the <span class="Italic">Var&#257;ha Pur&#257;&#7751;a,</span> where it is stated that by performance of sacrifice at this place, the strength of demoniac people is curtailed. Thus <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> prefer Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya for such sacrificial performances.</div>
<div class="Purport">The devotees of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u offer all kinds of sacrifices for His pleasure. The devotees are always attached to the service of the Lord, whereas fallen souls are attached to the pleasures of material existence. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> it is said that anything performed in the material world for any reason other than for the pleasure of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u causes further bondage for the performer. It is enjoined therefore that all acts must be performed sacrificially for the satisfaction of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and His devotees. This will bring everyone peace and prosperity.</div>
<div class="Purport">The great sages are always anxious to do good to the people in general, and as such the sages headed by &#346;aunaka and others assembled at this holy place of Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya with a program of performing a great and continuous chain of sacrificial ceremonies. Forgetful men do not know the right path for peace and prosperity. However, the sages know it well, and therefore for the good of all men they are always anxious to perform acts which may bring about peace in the world. They are sincere friends to all living entities, and at the risk of great personal inconvenience they are always engaged in the service of the Lord for the good of all people.<JD:"Destination-31"> Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is just like a great tree, and all others, including the demigods, men, Siddhas, C&#257;ra&#7751;as, Vidy&#257;dharas and other living entities, are like branches, twigs and leaves of that tree. By pouring water on the root of the tree, all the parts of the tree are automatically nourished. Only those branches and leaves which are detached cannot be so satisfied. Detached branches and leaves dry up gradually despite all watering attempts. Similarly, human society, when it is detached from the Personality of Godhead like detached branches and leaves, is not capable of being watered, and one attempting to do so is simply wasting his energy and resources.</div>
<div class="Purport">The modern materialistic society is detached from its relation to the Supreme Lord. And all its plans which are being made by atheistic leaders are sure to be baffled at every step. Yet they do not wake up to this.</div>
<div class="Purport">In this age, the congregational chanting of the holy names of the Lord is the prescribed method for waking up. The ways and means are most scientifically presented by Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, and intelligent persons may take advantage of His teachings in order to bring about real peace and prosperity. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is also presented for the same purpose, and this will be explained more specifically later in the text.</div>

<div class="Translation">One day, after finishing their morning duties by burning a sacrificial fire and offering a seat of esteem to &#346;r&#299;la S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299;, the great sages made inquiries, with great respect, about the following matters.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Morning is the best time to hold spiritual services. The great sages offered the speaker of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> an elevated seat of respect called the <span class="Italic">vy&#257;s&#257;sana,</span> or the seat of &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva. &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva is the original spiritual preceptor for all men. And all other preceptors are considered to be his representatives. A representative is one who can exactly present the viewpoint of &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva. &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva impregnated the message of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> unto &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, and &#346;r&#299; S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; heard it from him (&#346;r&#299; &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;). All bona fide representatives of &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva in the chain of disciplic succession are to be understood to be <span class="Italic">gosv&#257;m&#299;s.</span> These <span class="Italic">gosv&#257;m&#299;s</span> restrain all their senses, and they stick to the path made by the previous <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas.</span> The <span class="Italic">gosv&#257;m&#299;s</span> do not deliver lectures on the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> capriciously. Rather, they execute their services most carefully, following their predecessors who delivered the spiritual message unbroken to them.</div>
<div class="Purport">Those who listen to the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> may put questions to the speaker in order to elicit the clear meaning, but this should not be done in a challenging spirit. One must submit questions with a great regard for the speaker and the subject matter. This is also the way recommended in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> One must learn the transcendental subject by submissive aural reception from the right sources. Therefore these sages addressed the speaker S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; with great respect.</div>

Only by his satisfaction can one please the Personality of Godhead, and when he is dissatisfied there is only havoc on the path of spiritual realization." It is essential, therefore, that a disciple be very much obedient and submissive to the bona fide spiritual master. &#346;r&#299;la S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; fulfilled all these qualifications as a disciple, and therefore he was endowed with all favors by his learned and self-realized spiritual masters such as &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva and others.

<div class="Translation">O learned one, in this iron age of Kali men have but short lives. They are quarrelsome, lazy, misguided, unlucky and, above all, always disturbed.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The devotees of the Lord are always anxious for the spiritual improvement of the general public. When the sages of Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya analyzed the state of affairs of the people in this age of Kali, they foresaw that men would live short lives. In Kali-yuga, the duration of life is shortened not so much because of insufficient food but because of irregular habits. By keeping regular habits and eating simple food, any man can maintain his health. Overeating, over-sense gratification, overdependence on another's mercy, and artificial standards of living sap the very vitality of human energy. Therefore the duration of life is shortened.</div>
<div class="Purport">The people of this age are also very lazy, not only materially but in the matter of self-realization. The human life is especially meant for self-realization. That is to say, man should come to know what he is, what the world is, and what the supreme truth is. Human life is a means by which the living entity can end all the miseries of the hard struggle for life in material existence and by which he can return to Godhead, his eternal home. But, due to a bad system of education, men have no desire for self-realization. Even if they come to know about it, they unfortunately become victims of misguided teachers.</div>
<div class="Purport">In this age, men are victims not only of different political creeds and parties, but also of many different types of sense-gratificatory diversions, such as cinemas, sports, gambling, clubs, mundane libraries, bad association, smoking, drinking, cheating, pilfering, bickerings, and so on. Their minds are always disturbed and full of anxieties due to so many different engagements. In this age, many unscrupulous men manufacture their own religious faiths which are not based on any revealed scriptures, and very often people who are addicted to sense gratification are attracted by such institutions. Consequently, in the name of religion so many sinful acts are being carried on that the people in general have neither peace of mind nor health of body. The student (<span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span>) communities are no longer being maintained, and householders do not observe the rules and regulations of the <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha-&#257;&#347;rama.</span> Consequently, the so-called <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprasthas</span> and <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s</span> who come out of such <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha-&#257;&#347;ramas</span> are easily deviated from the rigid path. In the Kali-yuga the whole atmosphere is surcharged with faithlessness. Men are no longer interested in spiritual values. Material sense gratification is now the standard of civilization. For the maintenance of such material civilizations, man has formed complex nations and communities, and there is a constant strain of hot and cold wars between these different groups. It has become very difficult, therefore, to raise the spiritual standard due to the present distorted values of human society. The sages of Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya are anxious to disentangle all fallen souls, and here they are seeking the remedy from &#346;r&#299;la S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299;.</div>

<div class="Translation">There are many varieties of scriptures, and in all of them there are many prescribed duties, which can be learned only after many years of study in their various divisions. Therefore, O sage, please select the essence of all these scriptures and explain it for the good of all living beings, that by such instruction their hearts may be fully satisfied.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"><span class="Italic">&#256;tm&#257;,</span> or self, is distinguished from matter and material elements. It is spiritual in constitution, and thus it is never satisfied by any amount of material planning. All scriptures and spiritual instructions are meant for the satisfaction of this self, or <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;.</span> There are many varieties of approaches which are recommended for different types of living beings in different times and at different places. Consequently, the numbers of revealed scriptures are innumerable. There are different methods and prescribed duties recommended in these various scriptures. Taking into consideration the fallen condition of the people in general in this age of Kali, the sages of Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya suggested that &#346;r&#299; S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; relate the essence of all such scriptures because in this age it is not possible for the fallen souls to understand and undergo all the lessons of all these various scriptures in a <span class="Italic">var&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama</span> system.</div>
<div class="Purport">The <span class="Italic">var&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama</span> society was considered to be the best institution for lifting the human being to the spiritual platform, but due to Kali-yuga it is not possible to execute the rules and regulations of these institutions. Nor is it possible for the people in general to completely sever relations with their families as the <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</span> institution prescribes. The whole atmosphere is surcharged with opposition. And considering this, one can see that spiritual emancipation for the common man in this age is very difficult. The reason the sages presented this matter to &#346;r&#299; S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; is explained in the following verses.</div>

To take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord means to take shelter of the pure devotees. The pure devotees whose only business is serving are honored by the names Prabhup&#257;da and Vi&#7779;&#7751;up&#257;da, which indicate such devotees to be representatives of the lotus feet of the Lord. Anyone, therefore, who takes shelter of the lotus feet of a pure devotee by accepting the pure devotee as his spiritual master can be at once purified. Such devotees of the Lord are honored equally with the Lord because they are engaged in the most confidential service of the Lord, for they deliver out of the material world the fallen souls whom the Lord wants to return home, back to Godhead. Such pure devotees are better known as vicelords according to revealed scriptures. The sincere disciple of the pure devotee considers the spiritual master equal to the Lord, but always considers himself to be a humble servant of the servant of the Lord</I> [<I>Cc.

<div class="First">The age of Kali is the most condemned age due to its quarrelsome features. Kali-yuga is so saturated with vicious habits that there is a great fight at the slightest misunderstanding. Those who are engaged in the pure devotional service of the Lord, who are without any desire for self-aggrandizement and who are freed from the effects of fruitive actions and dry philosophical speculations are capable of getting out of the estrangements of this complicated age. The leaders of the people are very much anxious to live in peace and friendship, but they have no information of the simple method of hearing the glories of the Lord. On the contrary, such leaders are opposed to the propagation of the glories of the Lord. In other words, the foolish leaders want to completely deny the existence of the Lord. In the name of secular state, such leaders are enacting various plans every year. But by the insurmountable intricacies of the material nature of the Lord, all these plans for progress are being constantly frustrated. They have no eyes to see that their attempts at peace and friendship are failing. But here is the hint to get over the hurdle. If we want actual peace, we must open the road to understanding of the Supreme Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and glorify Him for His virtuous activities as they are depicted in the pages of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span></div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Personality of Godhead is never inactive as some less intelligent persons suggest. His works are magnificent and magnanimous. His creations both material and spiritual are all wonderful and contain all variegatedness. They are described nicely by such liberated souls as &#346;r&#299;la N&#257;rada, Vy&#257;sa, V&#257;lm&#299;ki, Devala, Asita, Madhva, &#346;r&#299; Caitanya, R&#257;m&#257;nuja, Vi&#7779;&#7751;usv&#257;m&#299;, Nimb&#257;rka, &#346;r&#299;dhara, Vi&#347;van&#257;tha, Baladeva, Bhaktivinoda, Siddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; and many other learned and self-realized souls. These creations, both material and spiritual, are full of opulence, beauty and knowledge, but the spiritual realm is more magnificent due to its being full of knowledge, bliss and eternity. The material creations are manifested for some time as perverted shadows of the spiritual kingdom and can be likened to cinemas. They attract people of less intelligent caliber who are attracted by false things. Such foolish men have no information of the reality, and they take it for granted that the false material manifestation is the all in all. But more intelligent men guided by sages like Vy&#257;sa and N&#257;rada know that the eternal kingdom of God is more delightful, larger, and eternally full of bliss and knowledge. Those who are not conversant with the activities of the Lord and His transcendental realm are sometimes favored by the Lord in His adventures as incarnations wherein He displays the eternal bliss of His association in the transcendental realm. By such activities He attracts the conditioned souls of the material world. Some of these conditioned souls are engaged in the false enjoyment of material senses and others in simply negating their real life in the spiritual world. These less intelligent persons are known as <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s,</span> or fruitive workers, and <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s,</span> or dry mental speculators. But above these two classes of men is the transcendentalist known as <span class="Italic">s&#257;tvata,</span> or the devotee, who is busy neither with rampant material activity nor with material speculation. He is engaged in the positive service of the Lord, and thereby he derives the highest spiritual benefit unknown to the <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">As the supreme controller of both the material and spiritual worlds, the Lord has different incarnations of unlimited categories. Incarnations like Brahm&#257;, Rudra, Manu, P&#7771;thu and Vy&#257;sa are His material qualitative incarnations, but His incarnations like R&#257;ma, Narasi&#7745;ha, Var&#257;ha and V&#257;mana are His transcendental incarnations. Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the fountainhead of all incarnations, and He is therefore the cause of all causes.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">There is a great difference between mundane stories, fiction, or history and the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. The histories of the whole universe contain references to the pastimes of the incarnations of the Lord. The <span class="Italic">R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a,</span> the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata,</span> and the <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> are histories of bygone ages recorded in connection with the pastimes of the incarnations of the Lord and therefore remain fresh even after repeated readings. For example, anyone may read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> or the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> repeatedly throughout his whole life and yet find in them new light of information. Mundane news is static whereas transcendental news is dynamic, inasmuch as the spirit is dynamic and matter is static. Those who have developed a taste for understanding the transcendental subject matter are never tired of hearing such narrations. One is quickly satiated by mundane activities, but no one is satiated by transcendental or devotional activities. <span class="Italic">Uttama-&#347;loka</span> indicates that literature which is not meant for nescience. Mundane literature is in the mode of darkness or ignorance, whereas transcendental literature is quite different. Transcendental literature is above the mode of darkness, and its light becomes more luminous with progressive reading and realization of the transcendental subject matter. The so-called liberated persons are never satisfied by the repetition of the words <span class="Italic">aha&#7745; brahm&#257;smi.</span> Such artificial realization of Brahman becomes hackneyed, and so to relish real pleasure they turn to the narrations of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> Those who are not so fortunate turn to altruism and worldly philanthropy. This means the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da philosophy is mundane, whereas the philosophy of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is transcendental.</div>

<div class="Translation">Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Personality of Godhead, along with Balar&#257;ma, played like a human being, and so masked He performed many superhuman acts.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The doctrines of anthropomorphism and zoomorphism are never applicable to &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, or the Personality of Godhead. The theory that a man becomes God by dint of penance and austerities is very much rampant nowadays, especially in India. Since Lord R&#257;ma, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu were detected by the sages and saints to be the Personality of Godhead as indicated in revealed scriptures, many unscrupulous men have created their own incarnations. This process of concocting an incarnation of God has become an ordinary business, especially in Bengal. Any popular personality with a few traits of mystic powers will display some feat of jugglery and easily become an incarnation of Godhead by popular vote. Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was not that type of incarnation. He was actually the Personality of Godhead from the very beginning of His appearance. He appeared before His so-called mother as four-armed Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Then, at the request of the mother, He became like a human child and at once left her for another devotee at Gokula, where He was accepted as the son of Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and Ya&#347;od&#257; M&#257;t&#257;. Similarly, &#346;r&#299; Baladeva, the counterpart of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, was also considered a human child born of another wife of &#346;r&#299; Vasudeva. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> the Lord says that His birth and deeds are transcendental and that anyone who is so fortunate as to know the transcendental nature of His birth and deeds will at once become liberated and eligible to return to the kingdom of God. So knowledge of the transcendental nature of the birth and deeds of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is sufficient for liberation. In the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> the transcendental nature of the Lord is described in nine cantos, and in the Tenth Canto His specific pastimes are taken up. All this becomes known as one's reading of this literature progresses. It is important to note here, however, that the Lord exhibited His divinity even from the lap of His mother, that His deeds are all superhuman (He lifted Govardhana Hill at the age of seven), and that all these acts definitely prove Him to be actually the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Yet, due to His mystic covering, He was always accepted as an ordinary human child by His so-called father and mother and other relatives. Whenever some herculean task was performed by Him, the father and mother took it otherwise. And they remained satisfied with unflinching filial love for their son. As such, the sages of Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya describe Him as apparently resembling a human being, but actually He is the Supreme Almighty Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="First">This age of Kali is not at all suitable for self-realization as was Satya-yuga, the golden age, or Tret&#257;- or Dv&#257;para-yugas, the silver and copper ages. For self-realization, the people in Satya-yuga, living a lifetime of a hundred thousand years, were able to perform prolonged meditation. And in Tret&#257;-yuga, when the duration of life was ten thousand years, self-realization was attained by performance of great sacrifice. And in the Dv&#257;para-yuga, when the duration of life was one thousand years, self-realization was attained by worship of the Lord. But in the Kali-yuga, the maximum duration of life being one hundred years only and that combined with various difficulties, the recommended process of self-realization is that of hearing and chanting of the holy name, fame, and pastimes of the Lord. The sages of Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya began this process in a place meant specifically for the devotees of the Lord. They prepared themselves to hear the pastimes of the Lord over a period of one thousand years. By the example of these sages one should learn that regular hearing and recitation of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the only way for self-realization. Other attempts are simply a waste of time, for they do not give any tangible results. Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu preached this system of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata-dharma,</span> and He recommended that all those who were born in India should take the responsibility of broadcasting the messages of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, primarily the message of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> And when one is well established in the teachings of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> he can take up the study of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> for further enlightenment in self-realization.</div>

<div class="First">The age of Kali is very dangerous for the human being. Human life is simply meant for self-realization, but due to this dangerous age, men have completely forgotten the aim of life. In this age, the life span will gradually decrease. People will gradually lose their memory, finer sentiments, strength, and better qualities. A list of the anomalies for this age is given in the Twelfth Canto of this work. And so this age is very difficult for those who want to utilize this life for self-realization. The people are so busy with sense gratification that they completely forget about self-realization. Out of madness they frankly say that there is no need for self-realization because they do not realize that this brief life is but a moment on our great journey towards self-realization. The whole system of education is geared to sense gratification, and if a learned man thinks it over, he sees that the children of this age are being intentionally sent to the slaughterhouses of so-called education. Learned men, therefore, must be cautious of this age, and if they at all want to cross over the dangerous ocean of Kali, they must follow the footsteps of the sages of Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya and accept &#346;r&#299; S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; or his bona fide representative as the captain of the ship.

The Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava stage is the postgraduate status of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> A progressive <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> must necessarily become a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, for a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is a self-realized, learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava from the beginning; therefore, there was no need for him to undergo all the processes of the <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</span> institution. Ultimately the aim of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> is to turn a crude man into a pure devotee of the Lord, or a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. Anyone, therefore, who becomes a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava accepted by the first-class Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, or <span class="Italic">uttama-adhik&#257;r&#299;</span> Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, is already considered a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> regardless of his birth or past deeds. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu accepted this principle and recognized &#346;r&#299;la Harid&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura as the <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya</span> of the holy name, although &#7788;h&#257;kura Harid&#257;sa appeared in a Mohammedan family. In conclusion, &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was born a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, and, therefore, brahminism was included in him. He did not have to undergo any ceremonies. Any lowborn person-be he a Kir&#257;ta, H&#363;&#7751;a, &#256;ndhra, Pulinda, Pulka&#347;a, &#256;bh&#299;ra, &#346;umbha, Yavana, Khasa or even lower-can be delivered to the highest transcendental position by the mercy of Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas. &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was the spiritual master of &#346;r&#299; S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299;, who therefore offers his respectful obeisances unto &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; before he begins his answers to the questions of the sages at Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya.</div>

<div class="Translation">Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto him [&#346;uka], the spiritual master of all sages, the son of Vy&#257;sadeva, who, out of his great compassion for those gross materialists who struggle to cross over the darkest regions of material existence, spoke this most confidential supplement to the cream of Vedic knowledge, after having personally assimilated it by experience.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In this prayer, &#346;r&#299;la S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; practically summarizes the complete introduction of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the natural supplementary commentary on the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tras.</span> The <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tras,</span> or the <span class="Italic">Brahma-s&#363;tras,</span> were compiled by Vy&#257;sadeva with a view to presenting just the cream of Vedic knowledge. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the natural commentary on this cream. &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was a thoroughly realized master on the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra,</span> and consequently he also personally realized the commentary, <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> And just to show his boundless mercy upon bewildered materialistic men who want to cross completely over nescience, he recited for the first time this confidential knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purport">There is no point in arguing that a materialistic man can be happy. No materialistic creature-be he the great Brahm&#257; or an insignificant ant-can be happy. Everyone tries to make a permanent plan for happiness, but everyone is baffled by the laws of material nature. Therefore the materialistic world is called the darkest region of God's creation. Yet the unhappy materialists can get out of it simply by desiring to get out. Unfortunately they are so foolish that they do not want to escape. Therefore they are compared to the camel who relishes thorny twigs because he likes the taste of the twigs mixed with blood. He does not realize that it is his own blood and that his tongue is being cut by the thorns. Similarly, to the materialist his own blood is as sweet as honey, and although he is always harassed by his own material creations, he does not wish to escape. Such materialists are called <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s.</span> Out of hundreds of thousands of <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s,</span> only a few may feel tired of material engagement and desire to get out of the labyrinth. Such intelligent persons are called <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s.</span> The <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra</span> is directed to such <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s.</span> But &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva, being the incarnation of the Supreme Lord, could foresee the misuse of the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra</span> by unscrupulous men, and, therefore, he personally supplemented the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra</span> with the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata Pur&#257;&#7751;a.</span> It is clearly said that this <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the original commentary on the <span class="Italic">Brahma-s&#363;tras.</span> &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva also instructed the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> to his own son, &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, who was already at the liberated stage of transcendence. &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva realized it personally and then explained it. By the mercy of &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva, the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata-ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra</span> is available for all those sincere souls who want to get out of material existence.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the one unrivaled commentary on <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra.</span> &#346;r&#299;p&#257;da &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya intentionally did not touch it because he knew that the natural commentary would be difficult for him to surpass. He wrote his <span class="Italic">&#346;&#257;r&#299;raka-bh&#257;&#7779;ya,</span> and his so-called followers deprecated the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> as some "new" presentation. One should not be misled by such propaganda directed against the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> by the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da school. From this introductory <span class="Italic">&#347;loka,</span> the beginning student should know that <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the only transcendental literature meant for those who are <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sas</span> and completely freed from the material disease called malice. The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s are envious of the Personality of Godhead despite &#346;r&#299;p&#257;da &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya's admission that N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, the Personality of Godhead, is above the material creation. The envious M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; cannot have access to the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> but those who are really anxious to get out of this material existence may take shelter of this <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> because it is uttered by the liberated &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;. It is the transcendental torchlight by which one can see perfectly the transcendental Absolute Truth realized as Brahman, Param&#257;tm&#257; and Bhagav&#257;n.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Since it has been stated hereinbefore that in the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> the Absolute Truth is to be known, the questions of the sages of Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya are proper and just, because they pertain to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth. In <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a>) the Personality of Godhead says that in all the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> there is nothing but the urge for searching after Him, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.

The human being, unless he is fast asleep at night, is busy with questions and answers.

The legislators in the parliament are also busy with questions and answers, and the politicians and the press representatives are all busy with questions and answers.

<div class="Translation">The supreme occupation [dharma] for all humanity is that by which men can attain to loving devotional service unto the transcendent Lord. Such devotional service must be unmotivated and uninterrupted to completely satisfy the self.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In this statement, &#346;r&#299; S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; answers the first question of the sages of Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya. The sages asked him to summarize the whole range of revealed scriptures and present the most essential part so that fallen people or the people in general might easily take it up. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> prescribe two different types of occupation for the human being. One is called the <span class="Italic">prav&#7771;tti-m&#257;rga,</span> or the path of sense enjoyment, and the other is called the <span class="Italic">niv&#7771;tti-m&#257;rga,</span> or the path of renunciation. The path of enjoyment is inferior, and the path of sacrifice for the supreme cause is superior. The material existence of the living being is a diseased condition of actual life. Actual life is spiritual existence, or <span class="Italic">brahma-bh&#363;ta </I>[</I>SB <a href="index2486.html?g=41459">4.30.20</a></I>]</span></I> existence, where life is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge. Material existence is temporary, illusory and full of miseries. There is no happiness at all. There is just the futile attempt to get rid of the miseries, and temporary cessation of misery is falsely called happiness. Therefore, the path of progressive material enjoyment, which is temporary, miserable and illusory, is inferior. But devotional service to the Supreme Lord, which leads one to eternal, blissful and all-cognizant life, is called the superior quality of occupation. This is sometimes polluted when mixed with the inferior quality. For example, adoption of devotional service for material gain is certainly an obstruction to the progressive path of renunciation. Renunciation or abnegation for ultimate good is certainly a better occupation than enjoyment in the diseased condition of life. Such enjoyment only aggravates the symptoms of disease and increases its duration. Therefore devotional service to the Lord must be pure in quality, i.e., without the least desire for material enjoyment. One should, therefore, accept the superior quality of occupation in the form of the devotional service of the Lord without any tinge of unnecessary desire, fruitive action and philosophical speculation. This alone can lead one to perpetual solace in His service.</div>
<div class="Purport">We have purposely denoted <span class="Italic">dharma</span> as occupation because the root meaning of the word <span class="Italic">dharma</span> is "that which sustains one's existence." A living being's sustenance of existence is to coordinate his activities with his eternal relation with the Supreme Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the central pivot of living beings, and He is the all-attractive living entity or eternal form amongst all other living beings or eternal forms. Each and every living being has his eternal form in the spiritual existence, and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the eternal attraction for all of them. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the complete whole, and everything else is His part and parcel. The relation is one of the servant and the served. It is transcendental and is completely distinct from our experience in material existence. This relation of servant and the served is the most congenial form of intimacy. One can realize it as devotional service progresses. Everyone should engage himself in that transcendental loving service of the Lord, even in the present conditional state of material existence. That will gradually give one the clue to actual life and please him to complete satisfaction.</div>

<div class="Translation">By rendering devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead, &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, one immediately acquires causeless knowledge and detachment from the world.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Those who consider devotional service to the Supreme Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a to be something like material emotional affairs may argue that in the revealed scriptures, sacrifice, charity, austerity, knowledge, mystic powers and similar other processes of transcendental realization are recommended. According to them, <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> or the devotional service of the Lord, is meant for those who cannot perform the high-grade activities. Generally it is said that the <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> cult is meant for the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras, vai&#347;yas</span> and the less intelligent woman class. But that is not the actual fact. The <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> cult is the topmost of all transcendental activities, and therefore it is simultaneously sublime and easy. It is sublime for the pure devotees who are serious about getting in contact with the Supreme Lord, and it is easy for the neophytes who are just on the threshold of the house of <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> To achieve the contact of the Supreme Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is a great science, and it is open for all living beings, including the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras, vai&#347;yas,</span> women and even those lower than the lowborn <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras,</span> so what to speak of the high-class men like the qualified <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and the great self-realized kings. The other high-grade activities designated as sacrifice, charity, austerity, etc., are all corollary factors following the pure and scientific <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> cult.</div>
<div class="Purport">The principles of knowledge and detachment are two important factors on the path of transcendental realization. The whole spiritual process leads to perfect knowledge of everything material and spiritual, and the results of such perfect knowledge are that one becomes detached from material affection and becomes attached to spiritual activities. Becoming detached from material things does not mean becoming inert altogether, as men with a poor fund of knowledge think. <span class="Italic">Nai&#7779;karma</span> means not undertaking activities that will produce good or bad effects. Negation does not mean negation of the positive. Negation of the nonessentials does not meant negation of the essential. Similarly, detachment from material forms does not mean nullifying the positive form. The <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> cult is meant for realization of the positive form. When the positive form is realized, the negative forms are automatically eliminated. Therefore, with the development of the <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> cult, with the application of positive service to the positive form, one naturally becomes detached from inferior things, and he becomes attached to superior things. Similarly, the <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> cult, being the supermost occupation of the living being, leads him out of material sense enjoyment. That is the sign of a pure devotee. He is not a fool, nor is he engaged in the inferior energies, nor does he have material values. This is not possible by dry reasoning. It actually happens by the grace of the Almighty. In conclusion, one who is a pure devotee has all other good qualities, namely knowledge, detachment, etc., but one who has only knowledge or detachment is not necessarily well acquainted with the principles of the <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> cult. <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> is the supermost occupation of the human being.</div>

<div class="Translation">The occupational activities a man performs according to his own position are only so much useless labor if they do not provoke attraction for the message of the Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">There are different occupational activities in terms of man's different conceptions of life. To the gross materialist who cannot see anything beyond the gross material body, there is nothing beyond the senses. Therefore his occupational activities are limited to concentrated and extended selfishness. Concentrated selfishness centers around the personal body-this is generally seen amongst the lower animals. Extended selfishness is manifested in human society and centers around the family, society, community, nation and world with a view to gross bodily comfort. Above these gross materialists are the mental speculators who hover aloft in the mental spheres, and their occupational duties involve making poetry and philosophy or propagating some <span class="Italic">ism</span> with the same aim of selfishness limited to the body and the mind. But above the body and mind is the dormant spirit soul whose absence from the body makes the whole range of bodily and mental selfishness completely null and void. But less intelligent people have no information of the needs of the spirit soul.</div>
<div class="Purport">Because foolish people have no information of the soul and how it is beyond the purview of the body and mind, they are not satisfied in the performance of their occupational duties. The question of the satisfaction of the self is raised herein. The self is beyond the gross body and subtle mind. He is the potent active principle of the body and mind. Without knowing the need of the dormant soul, one cannot be happy simply with emolument of the body and mind. The body and the mind are but superfluous outer coverings of the spirit soul. The spirit soul's needs must be fulfilled. Simply by cleansing the cage of the bird, one does not satisfy the bird. One must actually know the needs of the bird himself.</div>
<div class="Purport">The need of the spirit soul is that he wants to get out of the limited sphere of material bondage and fulfill his desire for complete freedom. He wants to get out of the covered walls of the greater universe. He wants to see the free light and the spirit. That complete freedom is achieved when he meets the complete spirit, the Personality of Godhead. There is a dormant affection for God within everyone; spiritual existence is manifested through the gross body and mind in the form of perverted affection for gross and subtle matter. Therefore we have to engage ourselves in occupational engagements that will evoke our divine consciousness. This is possible only by hearing and chanting the divine activities of the Supreme Lord, and any occupational activity which does not help one to achieve attachment for hearing and chanting the transcendental message of Godhead is said herein to be simply a waste of time. This is because other occupational duties (whatever <span class="Italic">ism</span> they may belong to) cannot give liberation to the soul. Even the activities of the salvationists are considered to be useless because of their failure to pick up the fountainhead of all liberties. The gross materialist can practically see that his material gain is limited only to time and space, either in this world or in the other. Even if he goes up to the Svargaloka, he will find no permanent abode for his hankering soul. The hankering soul must be satisfied by the perfect scientific process of perfect devotional service.</div>

<div class="First">We have already discussed that pure devotional service to the Lord is automatically followed by perfect knowledge and detachment from material existence. But there are others who consider that all kinds of different occupational engagements, including those of religion, are meant for material gain. The general tendency of any ordinary man in any part of the world is to gain some material profit in exchange for religious or any other occupational service. Even in the Vedic literatures, for all sorts of religious performances an allurement of material gain is offered, and most people are attracted by such allurements or blessings of religiosity. Why are such so-called men of religion allured by material gain? Because material gain can enable one to fulfill desires, which in turn satisfy sense gratification. This cycle of occupational engagements includes so-called religiosity followed by material gain and material gain followed by fulfillment of desires. Sense gratification is the general way for all sorts of fully occupied men. But in the statement of S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299;, as per the verdict of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> this is nullified by the present <span class="Italic">&#347;loka.</span></div>

<div class="Translation">Life's desires should never be directed toward sense gratification. One should desire only a healthy life, or self-preservation, since a human being is meant for inquiry about the Absolute Truth. Nothing else should be the goal of one's works.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The completely bewildered material civilization is wrongly directed towards the fulfillment of desires in sense gratification. In such civilization, in all spheres of life, the ultimate end is sense gratification. In politics, social service, altruism, philanthropy and ultimately in religion or even in salvation, the very same tint of sense gratification is ever-increasingly predominant. In the political field the leaders of men fight with one another to fulfill their personal sense gratification. The voters adore the so-called leaders only when they promise sense gratification. As soon as the voters are dissatisfied in their own sense satisfaction, they dethrone the leaders, The leaders must always disappoint the voters by not satisfying their senses. The same is applicable in all other fields; no one is serious about the problems of life. Even those who are on the path of salvation desire to become one with the Absolute Truth and desire to commit spiritual suicide for sense gratification. But the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> says that one should not live for sense gratification. One should satisfy the senses only insomuch as required for self-preservation, and not for sense gratification. Because the body is made of senses, which also require a certain amount of satisfaction, there are regulative directions for satisfaction of such senses. But the senses are not meant for unrestricted enjoyment. For example, marriage or the combination of a man with a woman is necessary for progeny, but it is not meant for sense enjoyment. In the absence of voluntary restraint, there is propaganda for family planning, but foolish men do not know that family planning is automatically executed as soon as there is search after the Absolute Truth. Seekers of the Absolute Truth are never allured by unnecessary engagements in sense gratification because the serious students seeking the Absolute Truth are always overwhelmed with the work of researching the Truth. In every sphere of life, therefore, the ultimate end must be seeking after the Absolute Truth, and that sort of engagement will make one happy because he will be less engaged in varieties of sense gratification. And what that Absolute Truth is is explained as follows.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Absolute Truth is both subject and object, and there is no qualitative difference there. Therefore, Brahman, Param&#257;tm&#257; and Bhagav&#257;n are qualitatively one and the same. The same substance is realized as impersonal Brahman by the students of the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads,</span> as localized Param&#257;tm&#257; by the Hira&#7751;yagarbhas or the <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s,</span> and as Bhagav&#257;n by the devotees. In other words, Bhagav&#257;n, or the Personality of Godhead, is the last word of the Absolute Truth. Param&#257;tm&#257; is the partial representation of the Personality of Godhead, and impersonal Brahman is the glowing effulgence of the Personality of Godhead, as the sun rays are to the sun-god. Less intelligent students of either of the above schools sometimes argue in favor of their own respective realization, but those who are perfect seers of the Absolute Truth know well that the above three features of the one Absolute Truth are different perspective views seen from different angles of vision.</div>
<div class="Purport">As it is explained in the first <span class="Italic">&#347;loka</span> of the First Chapter of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> the Supreme Truth is self-sufficient, cognizant and free from the illusion of relativity. In the relative world the knower is different from the known, but in the Absolute Truth both the knower and the known are one and the same thing. In the relative world the knower is the living spirit or superior energy, whereas the known is inert matter or inferior energy. Therefore, there is a duality of inferior and superior energy, whereas in the absolute realm both the knower and the known are of the same superior energy. There are three kinds of energies of the supreme energetic. There is no difference between the energy and energetic, but there is a difference of quality of energies. The absolute realm and the living entities are of the same superior energy, but the material world is inferior energy. The living being in contact with the inferior energy is illusioned, thinking he belongs to the inferior energy. Therefore there is the sense of relativity in the material world. In the Absolute there is no such sense of difference between the knower and the known, and therefore everything there is absolute.</div>

<div class="Translation">The seriously inquisitive student or sage, well equipped with knowledge and detachment, realizes that Absolute Truth by rendering devotional service in terms of what he has heard from the Ved&#257;nta-&#347;ruti.<span class="Italic"></span></div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Absolute Truth is realized in full by the process of devotional service to the Lord, V&#257;sudeva, or the Personality of Godhead, who is the full-fledged Absolute Truth. Brahman is His transcendental bodily effulgence, and Param&#257;tm&#257; is His partial representation. As such, Brahman or Param&#257;tm&#257; realization of the Absolute Truth is but a partial realization. There are four different types of human beings-the <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s,</span> the <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s,</span> the <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> and the devotees. The <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> are materialistic, whereas the other three are transcendental. The first-class transcendentalists are the devotees who have realized the Supreme Person. The second-class transcendentalists are those who have partially realized the plenary portion of the absolute person. And the third-class transcendentalists are those who have barely realized the spiritual focus of the absolute person. As stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and other Vedic literatures, the Supreme Person is realized by devotional service, which is backed by full knowledge and detachment from material association. We have already discussed the point that devotional service is followed by knowledge and detachment from material association. As Brahman and Param&#257;tm&#257; realization are imperfect realizations of the Absolute Truth, so the means of realizing Brahman and Param&#257;tm&#257;, i.e., the paths of <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na</span> and <span class="Italic">yoga,</span> are also imperfect means of realizing the Absolute Truth. Devotional service, which is based on the foreground of full knowledge combined with detachment from material association and which is fixed by the aural reception of the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-&#347;ruti,</span> is the only perfect method by which the seriously inquisitive student can realize the Absolute Truth. Devotional service is not, therefore, meant for the less intelligent class of transcendentalist. There are three classes of devotees, namely first, second, and third class. The third-class devotees, or the neophytes, who have no knowledge and are not detached from material association, but who are simply attracted by the preliminary process of worshiping the Deity in the temple, are called material devotees. Material devotees are more attached to material benefit than transcendental profit. Therefore, one has to make definite progress from the position of material devotional service to the second-class devotional position. In the second-class position, the devotee can see four principles in the devotional line, namely the Personality of Godhead, His devotees, the ignorant and the envious. One has to raise himself at least to the stage of a second-class devotee and thus become eligible to know the Absolute Truth.</div>
<div class="Purport">A third-class devotee, therefore, has to receive the instructions of devotional service from the authoritative sources of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata.</span> The number one <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata</span> is the established personality of devotee, and the other <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the message of Godhead. The third-class devotee therefore has to go to the personality of devotee in order to learn the instructions of devotional service. Such a personality of devotee is not a professional man who earns his livelihood by the business of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> Such a devotee must be a representative of &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, like S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299;, and must preach the cult of devotional service for the all-around benefit of all people. A neophyte devotee has very little taste for hearing from the authorities. Such a neophyte devotee makes a show of hearing from the professional man to satisfy his senses. This sort of hearing and chanting has spoiled the whole thing, so one should be very careful about the faulty process. The holy messages of Godhead, as inculcated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> or in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> are undoubtedly transcendental subjects, but even though they are so, such transcendental matters are not to be received from the professional man, who spoils them as the serpent spoils milk simply by the touch of his tongue.</div>
<div class="Purport">A sincere devotee must, therefore, be prepared to hear the Vedic literature like the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads, Ved&#257;nta</span> and other literatures left by the previous authorities or Gosv&#257;m&#299;s, for the benefit of his progress. Without hearing such literatures, one cannot make actual progress. And without hearing and following the instructions, the show of devotional service becomes worthless and therefore a sort of disturbance in the path of devotional service. Unless, therefore, devotional service is established on the principles of <span class="Italic">&#347;ruti, sm&#7771;ti, pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> or <span class="Italic">pa&ntilde;car&#257;tra</span> authorities, the make-show of devotional service should at once be rejected. An unauthorized devotee should never be recognized as a pure devotee. By assimilation of such messages from the Vedic literatures, one can see the all-pervading localized aspect of the Personality of Godhead within his own self constantly. This is called <span class="Italic">sam&#257;dhi.</span></div>

<div class="First">Human society all over the world is divided into four castes and four orders of life. The four castes are the intelligent caste, the martial caste, the productive caste and the laborer caste. These castes are classified in terms of one's work and qualification and not by birth. Then again there are four orders of life, namely the student life, the householder's life, the retired and the devotional life. In the best interest of human society there must be such divisions of life, otherwise no social institution can grow in a healthy state.

When the aim of life, i.e., realization of the Absolute Truth, is missed by too much attachment for <span class="Italic">indriya-pr&#299;ti,</span> or sense gratification, as already discussed hereinbefore, the institution of the <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</span> is utilized by selfish men to pose an artificial predominance over the weaker section. In the Kali-yuga, or in the age of quarrel, this artificial predominance is already current, but the saner section of the people know it well that the divisions of castes and orders of life are meant for smooth social intercourse and high-thinking self-realization and not for any other purpose.</div>
<div class="Purport">Herein the statement of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is that the highest aim of life or the highest perfection of the institution of the <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> is to cooperate jointly for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">If realization of the Absolute Truth is the ultimate aim of life, it must be carried out by all means. In any one of the above-mentioned castes and orders of life, the four processes, namely glorifying, hearing, remembering and worshiping, are general occupations. Without these principles of life, no one can exist. Activities of the living being involve engagements in these four different principles of life. Especially in modern society, all activities are more or less dependent on hearing and glorifying. Any man from any social status becomes a well-known man in human society within a very short time if he is simply glorified truly or falsely in the daily newspapers. Sometimes political leaders of a particular party are also advertised by newspaper propaganda, and by such a method of glorification an insignificant man becomes an important man-within no time. But such propaganda by false glorification of an unqualified person cannot bring about any good, either for the particular man or for the society. There may be some temporary reactions to such propaganda, but there are no permanent effects. Therefore such activities are a waste of time. The actual object of glorification is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has created everything manifested before us. We have broadly discussed this fact from the beginning of the "<span class="Italic">janm&#257;dy asya</span>"<span class="Italic"></I> [SB </I><a href="index4dab.html?g=6120">1.1.1</a></I>]</span></I> <span class="Italic">&#347;loka</span> of this <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> The tendency to glorify others or hear others must be turned to the real object of glorification-the Supreme Being.

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">With sword in hand, intelligent men cut through the binding knots of reactionary work [karma] by remembering the Personality of Godhead. Therefore, who will not pay attention to His message?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The contact of the spiritual spark with material elements creates a knot which must be cut if one wants to be liberated from the actions and reactions of fruitive work. Liberation means freedom from the cycle of reactionary work. This liberation automatically follows for one who constantly remembers the transcendental pastimes of the Personality of Godhead. This is because all the activities of the Supreme Lord (His <span class="Italic">l&#299;l&#257;</span>) are transcendental to the modes of the material energy. They are all-attractive spiritual activities, and therefore constant association with the spiritual activities of the Supreme Lord gradually spiritualizes the conditioned soul and ultimately severs the knot of material bondage.</div>
<div class="Purport">Liberation from material bondage is, therefore, a by-product of devotional service. Attainment of spiritual knowledge is not sufficient to insure liberation. Such knowledge must be overcoated with devotional service so that ultimately the devotional service alone predominates. Then liberation is made possible. Even the reactionary work of the fruitive workers can lead one to liberation when it is overcoated with devotional service. <span class="Italic">Karma</span> overcoated with devotional service is called <span class="Italic">karma-yoga.</span> Similarly, empirical knowledge overcoated with devotional service is called <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na-yoga.</span> But pure <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> is independent of such <span class="Italic">karma</span> and <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na</span> because it alone can not only endow one with liberation from conditional life but also award one the transcendental loving service of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purport">Therefore, any sensible man who is above the average man with a poor fund of knowledge must constantly remember the Personality of Godhead by hearing about Him, by glorifying Him, by remembering Him and by worshiping Him always, without cessation. That is the perfect way of devotional service. The Gosv&#257;m&#299;s of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, who were authorized by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu to preach the <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> cult, rigidly followed this rule and made immense literatures of transcendental science for our benefit. They have chalked out ways for all classes of men in terms of the different castes and orders of life in pursuance of the teachings of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> and similar other authoritative scriptures.</div>

<div class="Translation">O twice-born sages, by serving those devotees who are completely freed from all vice, great service is done. By such service, one gains affinity for hearing the messages of V&#257;sudeva.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The conditioned life of a living being is caused by his revolting against the Lord. There are men called <span class="Italic">deva,</span> or godly living beings, and there are men called <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> or demons, who are against the authority of the Supreme Lord. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (Sixteenth Chapter) a vivid description of the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> is given in which it is said that the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> are put into lower and lower states of ignorance life after life and so sink to the lower animal forms and have no information of the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. These <span class="Italic">asuras</span> are gradually rectified to God consciousness by the mercy of the Lord's liberated servitors in different countries according to the supreme will. Such devotees of God are very confidential associates of the Lord, and when they come to save human society from the dangers of godlessness, they are known as the powerful incarnations of the Lord, as sons of the Lord, as servants of the Lord or as associates of the Lord. But none of them falsely claim to be God themselves. This is a blasphemy declared by the <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> and the demoniac followers of such <span class="Italic">asuras</span> also accept pretenders as God or His incarnation. In the revealed scriptures there is definite information of the incarnation of God. No one should be accepted as God or an incarnation of God unless he is confirmed by the revealed scriptures.</div>
<div class="Purport">The servants of God are to be respected as God by the devotees who actually want to go back to Godhead. Such servants of God are called <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;s,</span> or <span class="Italic">t&#299;rthas,</span> and they preach according to particular time and place. The servants of God urge people to become devotees of the Lord. They never tolerate being called God. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu was God Himself according to the indication of the revealed scriptures, but He played the part of a devotee. People who knew Him to be God addressed Him as God, but He used to block His ears with His hands and chant the name of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. He strongly protested against being called God, although undoubtedly He was God Himself. The Lord behaves so to warn us against unscrupulous men who take pleasure in being addressed as God.</div>
<div class="Purport">The servants of God come to propagate God consciousness, and intelligent people should cooperate with them in every respect. By serving the servant of God, one can please God more than by directly serving the Lord. The Lord is more pleased when He sees that His servants are properly respected because such servants risk everything for the service of the Lord and so are very dear to the Lord. The Lord declares in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexaa3c.html?g=6024">18.69</a>) that no one is dearer to Him than one who risks everything to preach His glory. By serving the servants of the Lord, one gradually gets the quality of such servants, and thus one becomes qualified to hear the glories of God. The eagerness to hear about God is the first qualification of a devotee eligible for entering the kingdom of God.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Messages of the Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a are nondifferent from Him. Whenever, therefore, offenseless hearing and glorification of God are undertaken, it is to be understood that Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is present there in the form of transcendental sound, which is as powerful as the Lord personally. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, in His <span class="Italic">&#346;ik&#7779;&#257;&#7779;&#7789;aka,</span> declares clearly that the holy name of the Lord has all the potencies of the Lord and that He has endowed His innumerable names with the same potency. There is no rigid fixture of time, and anyone can chant the holy name with attention and reverence at his convenience. The Lord is so kind to us that He can be present before us personally in the form of transcendental sound, but unfortunately we have no taste for hearing and glorifying the Lord's name and activities. We have already discussed developing a taste for hearing and chanting the holy sound. It is done through the medium of service to the pure devotee of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purport">The Lord is reciprocally respondent to His devotees. When He sees that a devotee is completely sincere in getting admittance to the transcendental service of the Lord and has thus become eager to hear about Him, the Lord acts from within the devotee in such a way that the devotee may easily go back to Him. The Lord is more anxious to take us back into His kingdom than we can desire. Most of us do not desire at all to go back to Godhead. Only a very few men want to go back to Godhead. But anyone who desires to go back to Godhead, &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a helps in all respects.</div>
<div class="Purport">One cannot enter into the kingdom of God unless one is perfectly cleared of all sins. The material sins are products of our desires to lord it over material nature. It is very difficult to get rid of such desires. Women and wealth are very difficult problems for the devotee making progress on the path back to Godhead. Many stalwarts in the devotional line fell victim to these allurements and thus retreated from the path of liberation. But when one is helped by the Lord Himself, the whole process becomes as easy as anything by the divine grace of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purport">To become restless in the contact of women and wealth is not an astonishment, because every living being is associated with such things from remote time, practically immemorial, and it takes time to recover from this foreign nature. But if one is engaged in hearing the glories of the Lord, gradually he realizes his real position. By the grace of God such a devotee gets sufficient strength to defend himself from the state of disturbances, and gradually all disturbing elements are eliminated from his mind.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Here is the remedy for eliminating all inauspicious things within the heart which are considered to be obstacles in the path of self-realization. The remedy is the association of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatas.</span> There are two types of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatas,</span> namely the book <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata</span> and the devotee <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata.</span> Both the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatas</span> are competent remedies, and both of them or either of them can be good enough to eliminate the obstacles. A devotee <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata</span> is as good as the book <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata</span> because the devotee <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata</span> leads his life in terms of the book <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata</span> and the book <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata</span> is full of information about the Personality of Godhead and His pure devotees, who are also <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatas.</span> <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata</span> book and person are identical.</div>
<div class="Purport">The devotee <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata</span> is a direct representative of Bhagav&#257;n, the Personality of Godhead. So by pleasing the devotee <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata</span> one can receive the benefit of the book <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata.</span> Human reason fails to understand how by serving the devotee <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata</span> or the book <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata</span> one gets gradual promotion on the path of devotion. But actually these are facts explained by &#346;r&#299;la N&#257;radadeva, who happened to be a maidservant's son in his previous life. The maidservant was engaged in the menial service of the sages, and thus he also came into contact with them. And simply by associating with them and accepting the remnants of foodstuff left by the sages, the son of the maidservant got the chance to become the great devotee and personality &#346;r&#299;la N&#257;radadeva. These are the miraculous effects of the association of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatas.</span> And to understand these effects practically, it should be noted that by such sincere association of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatas</span> one is sure to receive transcendental knowledge very easily, with the result that he becomes fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. The more progress is made in devotional service under the guidance of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatas,</span> the more one becomes fixed in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. The messages of the book <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata,</span> therefore, have to be received from the devotee <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata,</span> and the combination of these two <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatas</span> will help the neophyte devotee to make progress on and on.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index7428.html?g=2487">7.3</a>) it is said that out of many thousands of ordinary men, one fortunate man endeavors for perfection in life. Mostly men are conducted by the modes of passion and ignorance, and thus they are engaged always in lust, desire, hankerings, ignorance and sleep. Out of many such manlike animals, there is actually a man who knows the responsibility of human life and thus tries to make life perfect by following the prescribed duties. And out of many thousands of such persons who have thus attained success in human life, one may know scientifically about the Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. In the same <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexbf7d.html?g=5898">18.55</a>) it is also said that scientific knowledge of &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is understood only by the process of devotional service (<span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga).</span></div>
<div class="Purport">The very same thing is confirmed herein in the above words. No ordinary man, or even one who has attained success in human life, can know scientifically or perfectly the Personality of Godhead. Perfection of human life is attained when one can understand that he is not the product of matter but is in fact spirit. And as soon as one understands that he has nothing to do with matter, he at once ceases his material hankerings and becomes enlivened as a spiritual being. This attainment of success is possible when one is above the modes of passion and ignorance, or, in other words, when one is actually a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> by qualification. A <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> is the symbol of <span class="Italic">sattva-gu&#7751;a,</span> or the mode of goodness. And others, who are not in the mode of goodness, are either <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas, vai&#347;yas, &#347;&#363;dras</span> or less than the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras.</span> The brahminical stage is the highest stage of human life because of its good qualities. So one cannot be a devotee unless one at least qualifies as a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> The devotee is already a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> by action. But that is not the end of it. As referred to above, such a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> has to become a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava in fact to be actually in the transcendental stage. A pure Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is a liberated soul and is transcendental even to the position of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> In the material stage even a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> is also a conditioned soul because although in the brahminical stage the conception of Brahman or transcendence is realized, scientific knowledge of the Supreme Lord is lacking. One has to surpass the brahminical stage and reach the <span class="Italic">vasudeva</span> stage to understand the Personality of Godhead K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The science of the Personality of Godhead is the subject matter for study by the postgraduate students in the spiritual line. Foolish men, or men with a poor fund of knowledge, do not understand the Supreme Lord, and they interpret K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a according to their respective whims. The fact is, however, that one cannot understand the science of the Personality of Godhead unless one is freed from the contamination of the material modes, even up to the stage of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> When a qualified <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> factually becomes a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, in the enlivened state of liberation he can know what is actually the Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation">Thus the knot in the heart is pierced, and all misgivings are cut to pieces. The chain of fruitive actions is terminated when one sees the self as master.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Attaining scientific knowledge of the Personality of Godhead means seeing one's own self simultaneously. As far as the identity of the living being as spirit self is concerned, there are a number of speculations and misgivings. The materialist does not believe in the existence of the spirit self, and empiric philosophers believe in the impersonal feature of the whole spirit without individuality of the living beings. But the transcendentalists affirm that the soul and the Supersoul are two different identities, qualitatively one but quantitatively different. There are many other theories, but all these different speculations are at once cleared off as soon as &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is realized in truth by the process of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is like the sun, and the materialistic speculations about the Absolute Truth are like the darkest midnight. As soon as the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a sun is arisen within one's heart, the darkness of materialistic speculations about the Absolute Truth and the living beings is at once cleared off. In the presence of the sun, the darkness cannot stand, and the relative truths that were hidden within the dense darkness of ignorance become clearly manifested by the mercy of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who is residing in everyone's heart as the Supersoul.</div>
<div class="Purport">In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexc2b4.html?g=3387">10.11</a>) the Lord says that in order to show special favor to His pure devotees, He personally eradicates the dense darkness of all misgivings by switching on the light of pure knowledge within the heart of a devotee. Therefore, because of the Personality of Godhead's taking charge of illuminating the heart of His devotee, certainly a devotee, engaged in His service in transcendental love, cannot remain in darkness. He comes to know everything of the absolute and the relative truths. The devotee cannot remain in darkness, and because a devotee is enlightened by the Personality of Godhead, his knowledge is certainly perfect. This is not the case for those who speculate on the Absolute Truth by dint of their own limited power of approach. Perfect knowledge is called <span class="Italic">parampar&#257;,</span> or deductive knowledge coming down from the authority to the submissive aural receiver who is bona fide by service and surrender. One cannot challenge the authority of the Supreme and know Him also at the same time. He reserves the right of not being exposed to such a challenging spirit of an insignificant spark of the whole, a spark subjected to the control of illusory energy. The devotees are submissive, and therefore the transcendental knowledge descends from the Personality of Godhead to Brahm&#257; and from Brahm&#257; to his sons and disciples in succession. This process is helped by the Supersoul within such devotees. That is the perfect way of learning transcendental knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purport">This enlightenment perfectly enables the devotee to distinguish spirit from matter because the knot of spirit and matter is untied by the Lord. This knot is called <span class="Italic">aha&#7749;k&#257;ra,</span> and it falsely obliges a living being to become identified with matter. As soon as this knot is loosened, therefore, all the clouds of doubt are at once cleared off. One sees his master and fully engages himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, making a full termination of the chain of fruitive action. In material existence, a living being creates his own chain of fruitive work and enjoys the good and bad effects of those actions life after life. But as soon as he engages himself in the loving service of the Lord, he at once becomes free from the chain of <span class="Italic">karma.</span> His actions no longer create any reaction.</div>

<div class="Translation">Certainly, therefore, since time immemorial, all transcendentalists have been rendering devotional service to Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Personality of Godhead, with great delight, because such devotional service is enlivening to the self.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The speciality of devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is specifically mentioned herein.

The living entities are separated parts and parcels of the Personality of Godhead. Therefore Lord Sri K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the original form of Godhead, and He is the last word in the Transcendence. Thus He is more attractive to the higher transcendentalists who participate in the eternal pastimes of the Lord. In forms of the Personality of Godhead other than &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and Baladeva, there is no facility for intimate personal contact as in the transcendental pastimes of the Lord at Vrajabh&#363;mi. The transcendental pastimes of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a are not newly accepted, as argued by some less intelligent persons; His pastimes are eternal and are manifested in due course once in a day of Brahm&#257;j&#299;, as the sun rises on the eastern horizon at the end of every twenty-four hours.</div>

<div class="Translation">The transcendental Personality of Godhead is indirectly associated with the three modes of material nature, namely passion, goodness and ignorance, and just for the material world's creation, maintenance and destruction He accepts the three qualitative forms of Brahm&#257;, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and &#346;iva. Of these three, all human beings can derive ultimate benefit from Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the form of the quality of goodness.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">That Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, by His plenary parts, should be rendered devotional service, as explained above, is confirmed by this statement. Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and all His plenary parts are <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-tattva,</span> or the Lordship of Godhead. From &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the next manifestation is Baladeva. From Baladeva is Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a, from Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a is N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, from N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a there is the second Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a, and from this Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a the Vi&#7779;&#7751;u <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a-avat&#257;ras.</span> The Vi&#7779;&#7751;u or the Deity of the quality of goodness in the material world is the <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a-avat&#257;ra</span> known as K&#7779;&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u or Param&#257;tm&#257;. Brahm&#257; is the deity of <span class="Italic">rajas</span> (passion), and &#346;iva of ignorance. They are the three departmental heads of the three qualities of this material world. Creation is made possible by the goodness of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and when it requires to be destroyed, Lord &#346;iva does it by the <span class="Italic">t&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avan&#7771;tya.</span> The materialists and the foolish human beings worship Brahm&#257; and &#346;iva respectively. But the pure transcendentalists worship the form of goodness, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, in His various forms. Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is manifested by His millions and billions of integrated forms and separated forms. The integrated forms are called Godhead, and the separated forms are called the living entities or the <span class="Italic">j&#299;vas.</span> Both the <span class="Italic">j&#299;vas</span> and Godhead have their original spiritual forms. <span class="Italic">J&#299;vas</span> are sometimes subjected to the control of material energy, but the Vi&#7779;&#7751;u forms are always controllers of this energy. When Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Personality of Godhead, appears in the material world, He comes to deliver the conditioned living beings who are under the material energy. Such living beings appear in the material world with intentions of being lords, and thus they become entrapped by the three modes of nature. As such, the living entities have to change their material coverings for undergoing different terms of imprisonment. The prison house of the material world is created by Brahm&#257; under instruction of the Personality of Godhead, and at the conclusion of a <span class="Italic">kalpa</span> the whole thing is destroyed by &#346;iva. But as far as maintenance of the prison house is concerned, it is done by Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, as much as the state prison house is maintained by the state. Anyone, therefore, who wishes to get out of this prison house of material existence, which is full of miseries like repetition of birth, death, disease and old age, must please Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u for such liberation. Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is worshiped by devotional service only, and if anyone has to continue prison life in the material world, he may ask for relative facilities for temporary relief from the different demigods like &#346;iva, Brahm&#257;, Indra and Varu&#7751;a. No demigod, however, can release the imprisoned living being from the conditioned life of material existence. This can be done only by Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Therefore, the ultimate benefit may be derived from Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Purport">It is a mistake, therefore, to consider that worship of any quality or any form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is equally beneficial.

<div class="Purport">The uncivilized state of life, or the life of the lower animals, is controlled by the mode of <span class="Italic">tamas.</span> The civilized life of man, with a passion for various types of material benefits, is the stage of <span class="Italic">rajas.</span> The <span class="Italic">rajas</span> stage of life gives a slight clue to the realization of the Absolute Truth in the forms of fine sentiments in philosophy, art and culture with moral and ethical principles, but the mode of <span class="Italic">sattva</span> is a still higher stage of material quality, which actually helps one in realizing the Absolute Truth. In other words, there is a qualitative difference between the different kinds of worshiping methods as well as the respective results derived from the predominating deities, namely Brahm&#257;, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and Hara.</div>

<div class="Translation">Those who are serious about liberation are certainly nonenvious, and they respect all. Yet they reject the horrible and ghastly forms of the demigods and worship only the all-blissful forms of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and His plenary portions.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Supreme Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who is the original person of the Vi&#7779;&#7751;u categories, expands Himself in two different categories, namely integrated plenary portions and separated parts and parcels. The separated parts and parcels are the servitors, and the integrated plenary portions of <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-tattvas</span> are the worshipful objects of service.</div>
<div class="Purport">All demigods who are empowered by the Supreme Lord are also separated parts and parcels. They do not belong to the categories of <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-tattva.</span> The <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-tattvas</span> are living beings equally as powerful as the original form of the Personality of Godhead, and they display different categories of power in consideration of different times and circumstances. The separated parts and parcels are powerful by limitation. They do not have unlimited power like the <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-tattvas.</span> Therefore, one should never classify the <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-tattvas,</span> or the plenary portions of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, the Personality of Godhead, in the same categories with the parts and parcels. If anyone does so he becomes at once an offender by the name <span class="Italic">p&#257;&#7779;a&#7751;&#7693;&#299;.</span> In the age of Kali many foolish persons commit such unlawful offenses and equalize the two categories.</div>
<div class="Purport">The separated parts and parcels have different positions in the estimation of material powers, and some of them are like K&#257;la-bhairava, &#346;ma&#347;&#257;na-bhairava, &#346;ani, Mah&#257;k&#257;l&#299; and Ca&#7751;&#7693;ik&#257;. These demigods are worshiped mostly by those who are in the lowest categories of the mode of darkness or ignorance. Other demigods, like Brahm&#257;, &#346;iva, S&#363;rya, Ga&#7751;e&#347;a and many similar deities, are worshiped by men in the mode of passion, urged on by the desire for material enjoyment. But those who are actually situated in the mode of goodness (<span class="Italic">sattva-gu&#7751;a</span>) of material nature worship only <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-tattvas.</span> <span class="Italic">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u-tattvas</span> are represented by various names and forms, such as N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, D&#257;modara, V&#257;mana, Govinda and Adhok&#7779;aja.</div>
<div class="Purport">The qualified <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> worship the <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-tattvas</span> represented by the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;lagr&#257;ma-&#347;il&#257;,</span> and some of the higher castes like the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> and <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas</span> also generally worship the <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-tattvas.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">Highly qualified <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> situated in the mode of goodness have no grudges against the mode of worship of others. They have all respect for other demigods, even though they may look ghastly, like K&#257;la-bhairava or Mah&#257;k&#257;l&#299;. They know very well that those horrible features of the Supreme Lord are all different servitors of the Lord under different conditions, yet they reject the worship of both horrible and attractive features of the demigods, and they concentrate only on the forms of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u because they are serious about liberation from the material conditions. The demigods, even to the stage of Brahm&#257;, the supreme of all the demigods, cannot offer liberation to anyone. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu underwent a severe type of penance to become eternal in life, but his worshipful deity, Brahm&#257;, could not satisfy him with such blessings. Therefore Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and none else, is called <span class="Italic">mukti-p&#257;da,</span> or the Personality of Godhead who can bestow upon us <span class="Italic">mukti,</span> liberation. The demigods, being like other living entities in the material world, are all liquidated at the time of the annihilation of the material structure. They are themselves unable to get liberation, and what to speak of giving liberation to their devotees. The demigods can award the worshipers some temporary benefit only, and not the ultimate one.</div>
<div class="Purport">It is for this reason only that candidates for liberation deliberately reject the worship of the demigods, although they have no disrespect for any one of them.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance worship the forefathers, other living beings and the demigods who are in charge of cosmic activities, for they are urged by a desire to be materially benefited with women, wealth, power and progeny.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">There is no need to worship demigods of whatsoever category if one is serious about going back to Godhead. In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexda67.html?g=2640">7.20</a>,23) it is clearly said that those who are mad after material enjoyment approach the different demigods for temporary benefits, which are meant for men with a poor fund of knowledge. We should never desire to increase the depth of material enjoyment. Material enjoyment should be accepted only up to the point of the bare necessities of life and not more or less than that. To accept more material enjoyment means to bind oneself more and more to the miseries of material existence. More wealth, more women and false aristocracy are some of the demands of the materially disposed man because he has no information of the benefit derived from Vi&#7779;&#7751;u worship. By Vi&#7779;&#7751;u worship one can derive benefit in this life as well as in life after death. Forgetting these principles, foolish people who are after more wealth, more wives and more children worship various demigods. The aim of life is to end the miseries of life and not to increase them.</div>
<div class="Purport">For material enjoyment there is no need to approach the demigods. The demigods are but servants of the Lord. As such, they are duty-bound to supply necessities of life in the form of water, light, air, etc. <span class="Italic">One should work hard and worship the Supreme Lord by the fruits of one's hard labor for existence, and that should be the motto of life.</span> One should be careful to execute occupational service with faith in God in the proper way, and that will lead one gradually on the progressive march back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purport">Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, when He was personally present at Vrajadh&#257;ma, stopped the worship of the demigod Indra and advised the residents of Vraja to worship by their business and to have faith in God. Worshiping the multidemigods for material gain is practically a perversity of religion. This sort of religious activity has been condemned in the very beginning of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> as <span class="Italic">kaitava-dharma.</span> There is only one religion in the world to be followed by one and all, and that is the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata-dharma,</span> or the religion which teaches one to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead and no one else.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">In the revealed scriptures, the ultimate object of knowledge is &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Personality of Godhead. The purpose of performing sacrifice is to please Him. Yoga is for realizing Him. All fruitive activities are ultimately rewarded by Him only. He is supreme knowledge, and all severe austerities are performed to know Him. Religion [dharma] is rendering loving service unto Him. He is the supreme goal of life.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">That &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Personality of Godhead, is the only object of worship is confirmed in these two <span class="Italic">&#347;lokas.</span> In the Vedic literature there is the same objective: establishing one's relationship and ultimately reviving our lost loving service unto Him. That is the sum and substance of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the same theory is confirmed by the Lord in His own words: the ultimate purpose of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is to know Him only. All the revealed scriptures are prepared by the Lord through His incarnation in the body of &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva just to remind the fallen souls, conditioned by material nature, of &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Personality of Godhead. No demigod can award freedom from material bondage. That is the verdict of all the Vedic literatures. Impersonalists who have no information of the Personality of Godhead minimize the omnipotency of the Supreme Lord and put Him on equal footing with all other living beings, and for this act such impersonalists get freedom from material bondage only with great difficulty. They can surrender unto Him only after many, many births in the culture of transcendental knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purport">One may argue that the Vedic activities are based on sacrificial ceremonies. That is true. But all such sacrifices are also meant for realizing the truth about V&#257;sudeva. Another name of V&#257;sudeva is Yaj&ntilde;a (sacrifice), and in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is clearly stated that all sacrifices and all activities are to be conducted for the satisfaction of Yaj&ntilde;a, or Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Personality of Godhead. This is the case also with the <span class="Italic">yoga</span> systems. <span class="Italic">Yoga</span> means to get into touch with the Supreme Lord. The process, however, includes several bodily features such as <span class="Italic">&#257;sana, dhy&#257;na, pr&#257;&#7751;&#257;y&#257;ma</span> and meditation, and all of them are meant for concentrating upon the localized aspect of V&#257;sudeva represented as Param&#257;tm&#257;. Param&#257;tm&#257; realization is but partial realization of V&#257;sudeva, and if one is successful in that attempt, one realizes V&#257;sudeva in full. But by ill luck most <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> are stranded by the powers of mysticism achieved through the bodily process. Ill-fated <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> are given a chance in the next birth by being placed in the families of good learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> or in the families of rich merchants in order to execute the unfinished task of V&#257;sudeva realization. If such fortunate <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and sons of rich men properly utilize the chance, they can easily realize V&#257;sudeva by good association with saintly persons. Unfortunately, such preferred persons are captivated again by material wealth and honor, and thus they practically forget the aim of life.</div>
<div class="Purport">This is also so for the culture of knowledge. According to <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> there are eighteen items in culturing knowledge. By such culture of knowledge one becomes gradually prideless, devoid of vanity, nonviolent, forbearing, simple, devoted to the great spiritual master, and self-controlled. By culture of knowledge one becomes unattached to hearth and home and becomes conscious of the miseries due to death, birth, old age and disease. And all culture of knowledge culminates in devotional service to the Personality of Godhead, V&#257;sudeva. Therefore, V&#257;sudeva is the ultimate aim in culturing all different branches of knowledge. Culture of knowledge leading one to the transcendental plane of meeting V&#257;sudeva is real knowledge. physical knowledge in its various branches is condemned in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as <span class="Italic">aj&ntilde;&#257;na,</span> or the opposite of real knowledge. The ultimate aim of physical knowledge is to satisfy the senses, which means prolongation of the term of material existence and thereby continuance of the threefold miseries. So prolonging the miserable life of material existence is nescience. But the same physical knowledge leading to the way of spiritual understanding helps one to end the miserable life of physical existence and to begin the life of spiritual existence on the plane of V&#257;sudeva.</div>
<div class="Purport">The same applies to all kinds of austerities. <span class="Italic">Tapasya</span> means voluntary acceptance of bodily pains to achieve some higher end of life. R&#257;va&#7751;a and Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu underwent a severe type of bodily torture to achieve the end of sense gratification. Sometimes modern politicians also undergo severe types of austerities to achieve some political end. This is not actually <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> One should accept voluntary bodily inconvenience for the sake of knowing V&#257;sudeva because that is the way of real austerities. Otherwise all forms of austerities are classified as modes of passion and ignorance. passion and ignorance cannot end the miseries of life. Only the mode of goodness can mitigate the threefold miseries of life. Vasudeva and Devak&#299;, the so-called father and mother of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, underwent penances to get V&#257;sudeva as their son. Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the father of all living beings (Bg. <a href="indexf156.html?g=4632">14.4</a>). Therefore He is the original living being of all other living beings. He is the original eternal enjoyer amongst all other enjoyers. Therefore no one can be His begetting father, as the ignorant may think. Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a agreed to become the son of Vasudeva and Devak&#299; upon being pleased with their severe austerities. Therefore if any austerities have to be done, they must be done to achieve the end of knowledge, V&#257;sudeva.</div>
<div class="Purport">V&#257;sudeva is the original Personality of Godhead Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. As explained before, the original Personality of Godhead expands Himself by innumerable forms. Such expansion of forms is made possible by His various energies. His energies are also multifarious, and His internal energies are superior and external energies inferior in quality. They are explained in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index7379.html?g=2496">7.4</a>-6) as the <span class="Italic">par&#257;</span> and the <span class="Italic">apar&#257; prak&#7771;tis.</span> So His expansions of various forms which take place via the internal energies are superior forms, whereas the expansions which take place via the external energies are inferior forms. The living entities are also His expansions. The living entities who are expanded by His internal potency are eternally liberated persons, whereas those who are expanded in terms of the material energies are eternally conditioned souls. Therefore, all culture of knowledge, austerities, sacrifice and activities should be aimed at changing the quality of the influence that is acting upon us. For the present, we are all being controlled by the external energy of the Lord, and just to change the quality of the influence, we must endeavor to cultivate spiritual energy. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is said that those who are <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;s,</span> or those whose minds have been so broadened as to be engaged in the service of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, are under the influence of the internal potency, and the effect is that such broadminded living beings are constantly engaged in the service of the Lord without deviation. That should be the aim of life. And that is the verdict of all the Vedic literatures. No one should bother himself with fruitive activities or dry speculation about transcendental knowledge. Everyone should at once engage himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Nor should one worship different demigods who work as different hands of the Lord for creation, maintenance or destruction of the material world. There are innumerable powerful demigods who look over the external management of the material world. They are all different assisting hands of Lord V&#257;sudeva. Even Lord &#346;iva and Lord Brahm&#257; are included in the list of demigods, but Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, or V&#257;sudeva, is always transcendentally situated. Even though He accepts the quality of goodness of the material world, He is still transcendental to all the material modes. The following example will clear that matter more explicitly. In the prison house there are the prisoners and the managers of the prison house. Both the managers and the prisoners are bound by the laws of the king. But even though the king sometimes comes in the prison, he is not bound by the laws of the prison house. The king is therefore always transcendental to the laws of the prison house, as the Lord is always transcendental to the laws of the material world.</div>

In the Vedic literatures (<span class="Italic">&#347;ruti</span>) it is said that there are two birds in one tree.<PW:Popup,3.03125,1.85417,Popup><div class="Verse-in-purp">dv&#257; supar&#7751;&#257; sayuj&#257; sakh&#257;y&#257;<br>sam&#257;na&#7745; v&#7771;k&#7779;a&#7745; pari&#7779;asvaj&#257;te<br>tayor anya&#7717; pippala&#7745; sv&#257;dv atty<br>ana&#347;nann anyo 'bhic&#257;ka&#347;&#299;ti</div></div>

That is the difference between the Supersoul and the conditioned soul. The conditioned soul, the living entity, is controlled by the laws of nature, while the Param&#257;tm&#257;, or the Supersoul, is the controller of the material energy.</div>

Matter, antimatter, proton, neutron, etc., are all different effects of the Param&#257;tm&#257; feature of the Lord. As from wood, fire can be manifested, or as butter can be churned out of milk, so also the presence of the Lord as Param&#257;tm&#257; can be felt by the process of legitimate hearing and chanting of the transcendental subjects which are especially treated in the Vedic literatures like the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads</span> and <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta.</span> <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the bona fide explanation of these Vedic literatures. The Lord can be realized through the aural reception of the transcendental message, and that is the only way to experience the transcendental subject. As fire is kindled from wood by another fire, the divine consciousness of man can similarly be kindled by another divine grace. His Divine Grace the spiritual master can kindle the spiritual fire from the woodlike living entity by imparting proper spiritual messages injected through the receptive ear. Therefore one is required to approach the proper spiritual master with receptive ears only, and thus divine existence is gradually realized. The difference between animality and humanity lies in this process only. A human being can hear properly, whereas an animal cannot.</div>

The eternal happiness which the living being wants is obtainable in the kingdom of God, but the forgetful living beings under the influence of the material modes have no information of the kingdom of God. The Lord, therefore, comes to propagate the message of the kingdom of God, either personally as an incarnation or through His bona fide representative as the good son of God.

<div class="Translation">S&#363;ta said: In the beginning of the creation, the Lord first expanded Himself in the universal form of the puru&#7779;a incarnation and manifested all the ingredients for the material creation. And thus at first there was the creation of the sixteen principles of material action. This was for the purpose of creating the material universe.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> states that the Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a maintains these material universes by extending His plenary expansions. So this <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a</span> form is the confirmation of the same principle. The original Personality of Godhead V&#257;sudeva, or Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who is famous as the son of King Vasudeva or King Nanda, is full with all opulences, all potencies, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge and all renunciation. Part of His opulences are manifested as impersonal Brahman, and part of His opulences are manifested as Param&#257;tm&#257;. This <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a</span> feature of the same Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the original Param&#257;tm&#257; manifestation of the Lord. There are three <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a</span> features in the material creation, and this form, who is known as the K&#257;ra&#7751;odaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, is the first of the three. The others are known as the Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and the K&#7779;&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, which we shall know one after another. The innumerable universes are generated from the skin holes of this K&#257;ra&#7751;odaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and in each one of the universes the Lord enters as Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u.</div>
<div class="Purport">In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is also mentioned that the material world is created at certain intervals and then again destroyed. This creation and destruction is done by the supreme will because of the conditioned souls, or the <span class="Italic">nitya-baddha</span> living beings. The <span class="Italic">nitya-baddha,</span> or the eternally conditioned souls, have the sense of individuality or <span class="Italic">aha&#7749;k&#257;ra,</span> which dictates them sense enjoyment, which they are unable to have constitutionally. The Lord is the only enjoyer, and all others are enjoyed. The living beings are predominated enjoyers. But the eternally conditioned souls, forgetful of this constitutional position, have strong aspirations to enjoy. The chance to enjoy matter is given to the conditioned souls in the material world, and side by side they are given the chance to understand their real constitutional position. Those fortunate living entities who catch the truth and surrender unto the lotus feet of V&#257;sudeva after many, many births in the material world join the eternally liberated souls and thus are allowed to enter into the kingdom of Godhead. After this, such fortunate living entities need not come again within the occasional material creation. But those who cannot catch the constitutional truth are again merged into the <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva</span> at the time of the annihilation of the material creation. When the creation is again set up, this <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva</span> is again let loose. This <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva</span> contains all the ingredients of the material manifestations, including the conditioned souls. Primarily this <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva</span> is divided into sixteen parts, namely the five gross material elements and the eleven working instruments or senses. It is like the cloud in the clear sky. In the spiritual sky, the effulgence of Brahman is spread all around, and the whole system is dazzling in spiritual light. The <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva</span> is assembled in some corner of the vast, unlimited spiritual sky, and the part which is thus covered by the <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva</span> is called the material sky. This part of the spiritual sky, called the <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva,</span> is only an insignificant portion of the whole spiritual sky, and within this <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva</span> there are innumerable universes. All these universes are collectively produced by the K&#257;ra&#7751;odaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, called also the Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, who simply throws His glance to impregnate the material sky.</div>

<div class="Translation">A part of the puru&#7779;a lies down within the water of the universe, from the navel lake of His body sprouts a lotus stem, and from the lotus flower atop this stem, Brahm&#257;, the master of all engineers in the universe, becomes manifest.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The first <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a</span> is the K&#257;ra&#7751;odaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. From His skin holes innumerable universes have sprung up. In each and every universe, the <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a</span> enters as the Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. He is lying within the half of the universe which is full with the water of His body. And from the navel of Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u has sprung the stem of the lotus flower, the birthplace of Brahm&#257;, who is the father of all living beings and the master of all the demigod engineers engaged in the perfect design and working of the universal order. Within the stem of the lotus there are fourteen divisions of planetary systems, and the earthly planets are situated in the middle. Upwards there are other, better planetary systems, and the topmost system is called Brahmaloka or Satyaloka. Downwards from the earthly planetary system there are seven lower planetary systems inhabited by the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> and similar other materialistic living beings.</div>
<div class="Purport">From Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u there is expansion of the K&#7779;&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, who is the collective Param&#257;tm&#257; of all living beings. He is called Hari, and from Him all incarnations within the universe are expanded.</div>
<div class="Purport">Therefore, the conclusion is that the <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a-avat&#257;ra</span> is manifested in three features - first the K&#257;ra&#7751;odaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; who creates aggregate material ingredients in the <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva,</span> second the Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; who enters in each and every universe, and third the K&#7779;&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u who is the Param&#257;tm&#257; of every material object, organic or inorganic. One who knows these plenary features of the Personality of Godhead knows Godhead properly, and thus the knower becomes freed from the material conditions of birth, death, old age and disease, as it is confirmed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> In this <span class="Italic">&#347;loka</span> the subject matter of Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is summarized. The Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u lies down in some part of the spiritual sky by His own free will. Thus He lies on the ocean of <span class="Italic">k&#257;ra&#7751;a,</span> from where He glances over His material nature, and the <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva</span> is at once created. Thus electrified by the power of the Lord, the material nature at once creates innumerable universes, just as in due course a tree decorates itself with innumerable grown fruits. The seed of the tree is sown by the cultivator, and the tree or creeper in due course becomes manifested with so many fruits. Nothing can take place without a cause. The K&#257;ra&#7751;a Ocean is therefore called the Causal Ocean. <span class="Italic">K&#257;ra&#7751;a</span> means "causal." We should not foolishly accept the atheistic theory of creation. The description of the atheists is given in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> The atheist does not believe in the creator, but he cannot give a good theory to explain the creation. Material nature has no power to create without the power of the <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a,</span> just as a <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti,</span> or woman, cannot produce a child without the connection of a <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a,</span> or man. The <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a</span> impregnates, and the <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti</span> delivers. We should not expect milk from the fleshy bags on the neck of a goat, although they look like breastly nipples. Similarly, we should not expect any creative power from the material ingredients; we must believe in the power of the <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a,</span> who impregnates <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti,</span> or nature. Because the Lord wished to lie down in meditation, the material energy created innumerable universes at once, in each of them the Lord lay down, and thus all the planets and the different paraphernalia were created at once by the will of the Lord. The Lord has unlimited potencies, and thus He can act as He likes by perfect planning, although personally He has nothing to do. No one is greater than or equal to Him. That is the verdict of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>

As stated above, the Lord extends His potency in the form of the <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva,</span> which includes all material ingredients.

In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is confirmed that the transcendental Lord can be perceived only by pure devotional service. So it is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> that only devotional service can lead one to the side of the Lord and that only devotional service can reveal Him. In the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> also it is said that the Lord is always visible to the devotees whose eyes have been anointed with the tinge of devotional service. So we have to take information of the transcendental form of the Lord from persons who have actually seen Him with perfect eyes smeared with devotional service. In the material world also we do not always see things with our own eyes; we sometimes see through the experience of those who have actually seen or done things. If that is the process for experiencing a mundane object, it is more perfectly applicable in matters transcendental. So only with patience and perseverance can we realize the transcendental subject matter regarding the Absolute Truth and His different forms. He is formless to the neophytes, but He is in transcendental form to the expert servitor.</div>

<div class="Translation">This form [the second manifestation of the puru&#7779;a] is the source and indestructible seed of multifarious incarnations within the universe. From the particles and portions of this form, different living entities, like demigods, men and others, are created.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a,</span> after creating innumerable universes in the <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva,</span> entered in each of them as the second <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a,</span> Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. When He saw that within the universe there was only darkness and space, without a resting place, He filled half of the universe with water from His own perspiration and laid Himself down on the same water. This water is called Garbhodaka. Then from His navel the stem of the lotus flower sprouted, and on the flower petals the birth of Brahm&#257;, or the master engineer of the universal plan, took place. Brahm&#257; became the engineer of the universe, and the Lord Himself took charge of the maintenance of the universe as Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Brahm&#257; was generated from <span class="Italic">rajo-gu&#7751;a</span> of <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti,</span> or the mode of passion in nature, and Vi&#7779;&#7751;u became the Lord of the mode of goodness. Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, being transcendental to all the modes, is always aloof from materialistic affection. This has already been explained. From Brahm&#257; there is Rudra (&#346;iva), who is in charge of the mode of ignorance or darkness. He destroys the whole creation by the will of the Lord. Therefore all three, namely Brahm&#257;, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and &#346;iva, are incarnations of the Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. From Brahm&#257; the other demigods like Dak&#7779;a, Mar&#299;ci, Manu and many others become incarnated to generate living entities within the universe. This Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is glorified in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> in the hymns of <span class="Italic">Garbha-stuti,</span> which begin with the description of the Lord as having thousands of heads, etc. The Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is the Lord of the universe, and although He appears to be lying within the universe, He is always transcendental. This also has already been explained. The Vi&#7779;&#7751;u who is the plenary portion of the Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is the Supersoul of the universal life, and He is known as the maintainer of the universe or K&#7779;&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. So the three features of the original <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a</span> are thus understood. And all the incarnations within the universe are emanations from this K&#7779;&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u.</div>
<div class="Purport"><JD:"Destination-55">In different millennia there are different incarnations, and they are innumerable, although some of them are very prominent, such as Matsya, K&#363;rma, Var&#257;ha, R&#257;ma, N&#7771;si&#7745;ha, V&#257;mana and many others. These incarnations are called <span class="Italic">l&#299;l&#257;</span> incarnations. Then there are qualitative incarnations such as Brahm&#257;, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and &#346;iva (or Rudra) who take charge of the different modes of material nature.</div>
<div class="Purport">Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is nondifferent from the Personality of Godhead. Lord &#346;iva is in the marginal position between the Personality of Godhead and the living entities, or <span class="Italic">j&#299;vas.</span> Brahm&#257; is always a <span class="Italic">j&#299;va-tattva.</span> The highest pious living being, or the greatest devotee of the Lord, is empowered with the potency of the Lord for creation, and he is called Brahm&#257;. His power is like the power of the sun reflected in valuable stones and jewels. When there is no such living being to take charge of the post of Brahm&#257;, the Lord Himself becomes a Brahm&#257; and takes charge of the post.</div>
<div class="Purport">Lord &#346;iva is not an ordinary living being. He is the plenary portion of the Lord, but because Lord &#346;iva is in direct touch with material nature, he is not exactly in the same transcendental position as Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. The difference is like that between milk and curd. Curd is nothing but milk, and yet it cannot be used in place of milk.</div>
<div class="Purport">The next incarnations are the Manus. Within one day's duration of the life of Brahm&#257; (which is calculated by our solar year as 4,300,000 x 1,000 years) there are fourteen Manus. Therefore there are 420 Manus in one month of Brahm&#257; and 5,040 Manus in one year of Brahm&#257;. Brahm&#257; lives for one hundred years of his age, and therefore there are 5,040 x 100 or 504,000 Manus in the duration of Brahm&#257;'s life. There are innumerable universes, with one Brahm&#257; in each of them, and all of them are created and annihilated during the breathing time of the <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a.</span> Therefore one can simply imagine how many millions of Manus there are during one breath of the <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">The Manus who are prominent within this universe are as follows: Yaj&ntilde;a as Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu, Vibhu as Sv&#257;roci&#7779;a Manu, Satyasena as Uttama Manu, Hari as T&#257;masa Manu, Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha as Raivata Manu, Ajita as C&#257;k&#7779;u&#7779;a Manu, V&#257;mana as Vaivasvata Manu (the present age is under the Vaivasvata Manu), S&#257;rvabhauma as S&#257;var&#7751;i Manu, &#7770;&#7779;abha as Dak&#7779;as&#257;var&#7751;i Manu, Vi&#7779;vaksena as Brahma-s&#257;var&#7751;i Manu, Dharmasetu as Dharma-s&#257;var&#7751;i Manu, Sudh&#257;m&#257; as Rudra-s&#257;var&#7751;i Manu, Yoge&#347;vara as Deva-s&#257;var&#7751;i Manu, and B&#7771;hadbh&#257;nu as Indra-s&#257;var&#7751;i Manu. These are the names of one set of fourteen Manus covering 4,300,000,000 solar years as described above.</div>
<div class="Purport">Then there are the <span class="Italic">yug&#257;vat&#257;ras,</span> or the incarnations of the millennia. The <span class="Italic">yugas</span> are known as Satya-yuga, Tret&#257;-yuga, Dv&#257;para-yuga and Kali-yuga. The incarnations of each <span class="Italic">yuga</span> are of different color. The colors are white, red, black and yellow. In the Dv&#257;para-yuga, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in black color appeared, and in the Kali-yuga Lord Caitanya in yellow color appeared.</div>
<div class="Purport">So all the incarnations of the Lord are mentioned in the revealed scriptures. There is no scope for an imposter to become an incarnation, for an incarnation must be mentioned in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras.</span> An incarnation does not declare Himself to be an incarnation of the Lord, but great sages agree by the symptoms mentioned in the revealed scriptures. The features of the incarnation and the particular type of mission which He has to execute are mentioned in the revealed scriptures.</div>
<div class="Purport">Apart from the direct incarnations, there are innumerable empowered incarnations. They are also mentioned in the revealed scriptures. Such incarnations are directly as well as indirectly empowered. When they are directly empowered they are called incarnations, but when they are indirectly empowered they are called <span class="Italic">vibh&#363;tis.</span> Directly empowered incarnations are the Kum&#257;ras, N&#257;rada, P&#7771;thu, &#346;e&#7779;a, Ananta, etc. As far as <span class="Italic">vibh&#363;tis</span> are concerned, they are very explicitly described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> in the <span class="Italic">Vibh&#363;ti-yoga</span> chapter. And for all these different types of incarnations, the fountainhead is the Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u.</div>

<div class="First">The creation of the material world is effected, maintained and then again annihilated at certain intervals.

The Kum&#257;ras, as above mentioned, appeared in the Kaum&#257;ra creation of the material world, and to teach us the process of Brahman realization, they underwent a severe type of disciplinary action as bachelors.

<div class="Translation">In the millennium of the &#7771;&#7779;is, the Personality of Godhead accepted the third empowered incarnation in the form of Devar&#7779;i N&#257;rada, who is a great sage among the demigods. He collected expositions of the Vedas which deal with devotional service and which inspire nonfruitive action.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The great &#7770;&#7779;i N&#257;rada, who is an empowered incarnation of the Personality of Godhead, propagates devotional service all over the universe. All great devotees of the Lord all over the universe and in different planets and species of life are his disciples. &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva, the compiler of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> is also one of his disciples.

The conditioned souls are mostly attracted by fruitive work because they want to enjoy life by the sweat of their own brows. The whole universe is full of fruitive workers in all species of life. The fruitive works include all kinds of economic development plans. But the law of nature provides that every action has its resultant reaction, and the performer of the work is bound up by such reactions, good or bad. The reaction of good work is comparative material prosperity, whereas the reaction of bad work is comparative material distress. But material conditions, either in so-called happiness or in so-called distress, are all meant ultimately for distress only. Foolish materialists have no information of how to obtain eternal happiness in the unconditional state. &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada informs these foolish fruitive workers how to realize the reality of happiness. He gives direction to the diseased men of the world how one's present engagement can lead one to the path of spiritual emancipation. The physician directs the patient to take treated milk in the form of curd for his sufferings from indigestion due to his taking another milk preparation. So the cause of the disease and the remedy of the disease may be the same, but it must be treated by an expert physician like N&#257;rada. The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> also gives the same solution of serving the Lord by the fruits of one's labor.

<div class="Translation">The eighth incarnation was King &#7770;&#7779;abha, son of King N&#257;bhi and his wife Merudev&#299;. In this incarnation the Lord showed the path of perfection, which is followed by those who have fully controlled their senses and who are honored by all orders of life.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The society of human being is naturally divided into eight by orders and statuses of life-the four divisions of occupation and four divisions of cultural advancement. The intelligent class, the administrative class, the productive class and the laborer class are the four divisions of occupation. And the student life, the householder's life, retired life and renounced life are the four statuses of cultural advancement towards the path of spiritual realization. Out of these, the renounced order of life, or the order of <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa,</span> is considered the highest of all, and a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> is constitutionally the spiritual master for all the orders and divisions. In the <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> order also there are four stages of upliftment toward perfection. These stages are called <span class="Italic">ku&#7789;&#299;caka, bah&#363;daka, parivr&#257;jak&#257;c&#257;rya,</span> and <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa.</span> The <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa</span> stage of life is the highest stage of perfection. This order of life is respected by all others. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#7770;&#7779;abha, the son of King N&#257;bhi and Merudev&#299;, was an incarnation of the Lord, and He instructed His sons to follow the path of perfection by <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> which sanctifies one's existence and enables one to attain the stage of spiritual happiness which is eternal and ever increasing. Every living being is searching after happiness, but no one knows where eternal and unlimited happiness is obtainable. Foolish men seek after material sense pleasure as a substitute for real happiness, but such foolish men forget that temporary so-called happiness derived from sense pleasures is also enjoyed by the dogs and hogs. No animal, bird or beast is bereft of this sense pleasure. In every species of life, including the human form of life, such happiness is immensely obtainable. The human form of life, however, is not meant for such cheap happiness. The human life is meant for attaining eternal and unlimited happiness by spiritual realization. This spiritual realization is obtained by <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> or undergoing voluntarily the path of penance and abstinence from material pleasure. Those who have been trained for abstinence in material pleasures are called <span class="Italic">dh&#299;ra,</span> or men undisturbed by the senses. Only these <span class="Italic">dh&#299;ras</span> can accept the orders of <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa,</span> and they can gradually rise to the status of the <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa,</span> which is adored by all members of society. King &#7770;&#7779;abha propagated this mission, and at the last stage He became completely aloof from the material bodily needs, which is a rare stage not to be imitated by foolish men, but to be worshiped by all.</div>

<div class="Translation">In the eighteenth incarnation, the Lord appeared as King R&#257;ma. In order to perform some pleasing work for the demigods, He exhibited superhuman powers by controlling the Indian Ocean and then killing the atheist King R&#257;va&#7751;a, who was on the other side of the sea.</div>

<div class="First">The Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; R&#257;ma assumed the form of a human being and appeared on the earth for the purpose of doing some pleasing work for the demigods or the administrative personalities to maintain the order of the universe. Sometimes great demons and atheists like R&#257;va&#7751;a and Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu and many others become very famous due to advancing material civilization by the help of material science and other activities with a spirit of challenging the established order of the Lord. For example, the attempt to fly to other planets by material means is a challenge to the established order. The conditions of each and every planet are different, and different classes of human beings are accommodated there for particular purposes mentioned in the codes of the Lord. But, puffed up by tiny success in material advancement, sometimes the godless materialists challenge the existence of God. R&#257;va&#7751;a was one of them, and he wanted to deport ordinary men to the planet of Indra (heaven) by material means without consideration of the necessary qualifications. He wanted a staircase to be built up directly reaching the heavenly planet so that people might not be required to undergo the routine of pious work necessary to enter that planet. He also wanted to perform other acts against the established rule of the Lord. He even challenged the authority of &#346;r&#299; R&#257;ma, the Personality of Godhead, and kidnapped His wife, S&#299;t&#257;. Of course Lord R&#257;ma came to chastise this atheist, answering the prayer and desire of the demigods. He therefore took up the challenge of R&#257;va&#7751;a, and the complete activity is the subject matter of the <span class="Italic">R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a.</span> Because Lord R&#257;macandra was the Personality of Godhead, He exhibited superhuman activities which no human being, including the materially advanced R&#257;va&#7751;a, could perform. Lord R&#257;macandra prepared a royal road on the Indian Ocean with stones that floated on the water. The modern scientists have done research in the area of weightlessness, but it is not possible to bring in weightlessness anywhere and everywhere. But because weightlessness is the creation of the Lord by which He can make the gigantic planets fly and float in the air, He made the stones even within this earth to be weightless and prepared a stone bridge on the sea without any supporting pillar. That is the display of the power of God.</div>

<div class="Translation">Then, in the beginning of Kali-yuga, the Lord will appear as Lord Buddha, the son of A&ntilde;jana, in the province of Gay&#257;, just for the purpose of deluding those who are envious of the faithful theist.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Lord Buddha, a powerful incarnation of the Personality of Godhead, appeared in the province of Gay&#257; (Bihar) as the son of A&ntilde;jana, and he preached his own conception of nonviolence and deprecated even the animal sacrifices sanctioned in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> At the time when Lord Buddha appeared, the people in general were atheistic and preferred animal flesh to anything else. On the plea of Vedic sacrifice, every place was practically turned into a slaughterhouse, and animal killing was indulged in unrestrictedly. Lord Buddha preached nonviolence, taking pity on the poor animals. He preached that he did not believe in the tenets of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and stressed the adverse psychological effects incurred by animal killing. Less intelligent men of the age of Kali, who had no faith in God, followed his principle, and for the time being they were trained in moral discipline and nonviolence, the preliminary steps for proceeding further on the path of God realization. He deluded the atheists because such atheists who followed his principles did not believe in God, but they kept their absolute faith in Lord Buddha, who himself was the incarnation of God. Thus the faithless people were made to believe in God in the form of Lord Buddha. That was the mercy of Lord Buddha: he made the faithless faithful to him.</div>
<div class="Purport">Killing of animals before the advent of Lord Buddha was the most prominent feature of the society. People claimed that these were Vedic sacrifices. When the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are not accepted through the authoritative disciplic succession, the casual readers of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are misled by the flowery language of that system of knowledge. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> a comment has been made on such foolish scholars (<span class="Italic">avipa&#347;cita&#7717;</span>). The foolish scholars of Vedic literature who do not care to receive the transcendental message through the transcendental realized sources of disciplic succession are sure to be bewildered. To them, the ritualistic ceremonies are considered to be all in all. They have no depth of knowledge. According to the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a>), <span class="Italic">vedai&#347; ca sarvair aham eva vedya&#7717;:</span> the whole system of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is to lead one gradually to the path of the Supreme Lord. The whole theme of Vedic literature is to know the Supreme Lord, the individual soul, the cosmic situation and the relation between all these items. When the relation is known, the relative function begins, and as a result of such a function the ultimate goal of life or going back to Godhead takes place in the easiest manner. Unfortunately, unauthorized scholars of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> become captivated by the purificatory ceremonies only, and natural progress is thereby checked.</div>
<div class="Purport">To such bewildered persons of atheistic propensity, Lord Buddha is the emblem of theism. He therefore first of all wanted to check the habit of animal killing. The animal killers are dangerous elements on the path going back to Godhead. There are two types of animal killers. The soul is also sometimes called the "animal" or the living being. Therefore, both the slaughterer of animals and those who have lost their identity of soul are animal killers.</div>
<div class="Purport">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it said that only the animal killer cannot relish the transcendental message of the Supreme Lord. Therefore if people are to be educated to the path of Godhead, they must be taught first and foremost to <span class="Italic">stop the process of animal killing</span> as above mentioned. <span class="Italic">It is nonsensical to say that animal killing has nothing to do with spiritual realization.</span> By this dangerous theory many so-called <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s</span> have sprung up by the grace of Kali-yuga who preach animal killing under the garb of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> The subject matter has already been discussed in the conversation between Lord Caitanya and Maulana Chand Kazi Shaheb. The animal sacrifice as stated in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is different from the unrestricted animal killing in the slaughterhouse. Because the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> or the so-called scholars of Vedic literatures put forward the evidence of animal killing in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> Lord Buddha superficially denied the authority of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> This rejection of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> by Lord Buddha was adopted in order to save people from the vice of animal killing as well as to save the poor animals from the slaughtering process of their big brothers who clamor for universal brotherhood, peace, justice and equity. There is no justice when there is animal killing. Lord Buddha wanted to stop it completely, and therefore his cult of <span class="Italic">ahi&#7745;s&#257;</span> was propagated not only in India but also outside the country.</div>
<div class="Purport">Technically Lord Buddha's philosophy is called atheistic because there is no acceptance of the Supreme Lord and because that system of philosophy denied the authority of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> But that is an act of camouflage by the Lord. Lord Buddha is the incarnation of Godhead. As such, he is the original propounder of Vedic knowledge. He therefore cannot reject Vedic philosophy. But he rejected it outwardly because the <span class="Italic">sura-dvi&#7779;a,</span> or the demons who are always envious of the devotees of Godhead, try to support cow killing or animal killing from the pages of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> and this is now being done by the modernized <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s.</span> Lord Buddha had to reject the authority of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> altogether. This is simply technical, and had it not been so he would not have been so accepted as the incarnation of Godhead. Nor would he have been worshiped in the transcendental songs of the poet Jayadeva, who is a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya.</span> Lord Buddha preached the preliminary principles of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> in a manner suitable for the time being (and so also did &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya) to establish the authority of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> Therefore both Lord Buddha and &#256;c&#257;rya &#346;a&#7749;kara paved the path of theism, and Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas,</span> specifically Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, led the people on the path towards a realization of going back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purport">We are glad that people are taking interest in the nonviolent movement of Lord Buddha. But will they take the matter very seriously and close the animal slaughterhouses altogether? If not, there is no meaning to the <span class="Italic">ahi&#7745;s&#257;</span> cult.</div>
<div class="Purport"><I>&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</I> was composed just prior to the beginning of the age of Kali (about five thousand years ago), and Lord Buddha appeared about twenty-six hundred years ago. Therefore in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> Lord Buddha is foretold. Such is the authority of this clear scripture. There are many such prophecies, and they are being fulfilled one after another. They will indicate the positive standing of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> which is without <span class="Italic">trace of mistake, illusion, cheating and imperfection,</span> which are the four flaws of all conditioned souls. The liberated souls are above these flaws; therefore they can see and foretell things which are to take place on distant future dates.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The list of incarnations of the Personality of Godhead given herein is not complete. It is only a partial view of all the incarnations. There are many others, such as &#346;r&#299; Hayagr&#299;va, Hari, Ha&#7745;sa, P&#7771;&#347;nigarbha, Vibhu, Satyasena, Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha, S&#257;rvabhauma, Vi&#7779;vaksena, Dharmasetu, Sudh&#257;m&#257;, Yoge&#347;vara, B&#7771;hadbh&#257;nu and others of the bygone ages. &#346;r&#299; Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja said in his prayer, "My Lord, You manifest as many incarnations as there are species of life, namely the aquatics, the vegetables, the reptiles, the birds, the beasts, the men, the demigods, etc., just for the maintenance of the faithful and the annihilation of the unfaithful.

Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu are not, therefore, incarnations, but the original source of all other incarnations. This will be clearly explained in the next <span class="Italic">&#347;loka.</span> So the Lord is the inexhaustible source for innumerable incarnations which are not always mentioned. But such incarnations are distinguished by specific extraordinary feats which are impossible to be performed by any living being. That is the general test to identify an incarnation of the Lord, directly and indirectly empowered. Some incarnations mentioned above are almost plenary portions. For instance, the Kum&#257;ras are empowered with transcendental knowledge. &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada is empowered with devotional service. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu is an empowered incarnation with executive function. The Matsya incarnation is directly a plenary portion. So the innumerable incarnations of the Lord are manifested all over the universes constantly, without cessation, as water flows constantly from waterfalls.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">All of the above-mentioned incarnations are either plenary portions or portions of the plenary portions of the Lord, but Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the original Personality of Godhead. All of them appear on planets whenever there is a disturbance created by the atheists. The Lord incarnates to protect the theists.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In this particular stanza Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Personality of Godhead, is distinguished from other incarnations. He is counted amongst the <span class="Italic">avat&#257;ras</span> (incarnations) because out of His causeless mercy the Lord descends from His transcendental abode. <span class="Italic">Avat&#257;ra</span> means "one who descends." All the incarnations of the Lord, including the Lord Himself, descend on the different planets of the material world as also in different species of life to fulfill particular missions. Sometimes He comes Himself, and sometimes His different plenary portions or parts of the plenary portions, or His differentiated portions directly or indirectly empowered by Him, descend on this material world to execute certain specific functions. Originally the Lord is full of all opulences, all prowess, all fames, all beauties, all knowledge and all renunciations. When they are partly manifested through the plenary portions or parts of the plenary portions, it should be noted that certain manifestations of His different powers are required for those particular functions. When in the room small electric bulbs are displayed, it does not mean that the electric powerhouse is limited by the small bulbs. The same powerhouse can supply power to operate large-scale industrial dynamos with greater volts. Similarly, the incarnations of the Lord display limited powers because so much power is needed at that particular time.</div>
<div class="Purport">For example, Lord Para&#347;ur&#257;ma and Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;ha displayed unusual opulence by killing the disobedient <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> twenty-one times and killing the greatly powerful atheist Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was so powerful that even the demigods in other planets would tremble simply by the unfavorable raising of his eyebrow. The demigods in the higher level of material existence many, many times excel the most well-to-do human beings, in duration of life, beauty, wealth, paraphernalia, and in all other respects. Still they were afraid of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu. Thus we can simply imagine how powerful Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was in this material world. But even Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was cut into small pieces by the nails of Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;ha. This means that anyone materially powerful cannot stand the strength of the Lord's nails. Similarly, J&#257;madagnya displayed the Lord's power to kill all the disobedient kings powerfully situated in their respective states. The Lord's empowered incarnation N&#257;rada and plenary incarnation Var&#257;ha, as well as indirectly empowered Lord Buddha, created faith in the mass of people. The incarnations of R&#257;ma and Dhanvantari displayed His fame, and Balar&#257;ma, Mohin&#299; and V&#257;mana exhibited His beauty. Datt&#257;treya, Matsya, Kum&#257;ra and Kapila exhibited His transcendental knowledge. Nara and N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a &#7770;&#7779;is exhibited His renunciation. So all the different incarnations of the Lord indirectly or directly manifested different features, but Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the primeval Lord, exhibited the complete features of Godhead, and thus it is confirmed that He is the source of all other incarnations. And the most extraordinary feature exhibited by Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was His internal energetic manifestation of His pastimes with the cowherd girls. His pastimes with the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> are all displays of transcendental existence, bliss and knowledge, although these are manifested apparently as sex love. The specific attraction of His pastimes with the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> should never be misunderstood. The <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> relates these transcendental pastimes in the Tenth Canto. And in order to reach the position to understand the transcendental nature of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's pastimes with the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s,</span> the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> promotes the student gradually in nine other cantos.</div>
<div class="Purport">According to &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;'s statement, in accordance with authoritative sources, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the source of all other incarnations. It is not that Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a has any source of incarnation. All the symptoms of the Supreme Truth in full are present in the person of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the Lord emphatically declares that there is no truth greater than or equal to Himself. In this stanza the word <span class="Italic">svayam</span> is particularly mentioned to confirm that Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a has no other source than Himself. Although in other places the incarnations are described as <span class="Italic">bhagav&#257;n</span> because of their specific functions, nowhere are they declared to be the Supreme Personality. In this stanza the word <span class="Italic">svayam</span> signifies the supremacy as the <span class="Italic">summum bonum.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">The <span class="Italic">summum bonum</span> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is one without a second. He Himself has expanded Himself in various parts, portions and particles as <span class="Italic">svaya&#7745;-r&#363;pa, svayam-prak&#257;&#347;a, tad-ek&#257;tm&#257;, pr&#257;bhava, vaibhava, vil&#257;sa, avat&#257;ra, &#257;ve&#347;a,</span> and <span class="Italic">j&#299;vas,</span> all provided with innumerable energies just suitable to the respective persons and personalities. Learned scholars in transcendental subjects have carefully analyzed the <span class="Italic">summum bonum</span> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a to have sixty-four principal attributes. All the expansions or categories of the Lord possess only some percentages of these attributes. But &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the possessor of the attributes cent percent. And His personal expansions such as <span class="Italic">svayam-prak&#257;&#347;a, tad-ek&#257;tm&#257;</span> up to the categories of the <span class="Italic">avat&#257;ras</span> who are all <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-tattva,</span> possess up to ninety-three percent of these transcendental attributes. Lord &#346;iva, who is neither <span class="Italic">avat&#257;ra</span> nor <span class="Italic">&#257;ve&#347;a</span> nor in between them, possesses almost eighty-four percent of the attributes. But the <span class="Italic">j&#299;vas,</span> or the individual living beings in different statuses of life, possess up to the limit of seventy-eight percent of the attributes. In the conditioned state of material existence, the living being possesses these attributes in very minute quantity, varying in terms of the pious life of the living being. The most perfect of living beings is Brahm&#257;, the supreme administrator of one universe. He possesses seventy-eight percent of the attributes in full. All other demigods have the same attributes in less quantity, whereas human beings possess the attributes in very minute quantity. The standard of perfection for a human being is to develop the attributes up to seventy-eight percent in full. The living being can never possess attributes like &#346;iva, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u or Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. A living being can become godly by developing the seventy-eight-percent transcendental attributes in fullness, but he can never become a God like &#346;iva, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. He can become a Brahm&#257; in due course. The godly living beings who are all residents of the planets in the spiritual sky are eternal associates of God in different spiritual planets called Hari-dh&#257;ma and Mahe&#347;a-dh&#257;ma. The abode of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a above all spiritual planets is called K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;aloka or Goloka V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, and the perfected living being, by developing seventy-eight percent of the above attributes in fullness, can enter the planet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;aloka after leaving the present material body.</div>

<div class="First">In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the Personality of Godhead has declared that anyone who knows the principles of the transcendental birth and activities of the Lord will go back to Godhead after being relieved from this material tabernacle. So simply knowing factually the mysterious way of the Lord's incarnation in this material world can liberate one from material bondage. Therefore the birth and activities of the Lord, as manifested by Him for the welfare of the people in general, are not ordinary. They are mysterious, and only by those who carefully try to go deep into the matter by spiritual devotion is the mystery discovered. Thus one gets liberation from material bondage. It is advised therefore that one who simply recites this chapter of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> describing the appearance of the Lord in different incarnations, in sincerity and devotion, can have insight into the birth and activities of the Lord. The very word <span class="Italic">vimukti,</span> or liberation, indicates that the Lord's birth and activities are all transcendental; otherwise simply by reciting them one could not attain liberation. They are therefore mysterious, and those who do not follow the prescribed regulations of devotional service are not entitled to enter into the mysteries of His births and activities.</div>

The gross body and psychic functions cease to act as soon as the living being leaves the visible gross body. In fact, we say that the living being has gone away because he is unseen and unheard. Even when the gross body is not acting when the living being is in sound sleep, we know that he is within the body by his breathing.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The difference between self-realization and material illusion is to know that the temporary or illusory impositions of material energy in the shape of gross and subtle bodies are superficial coverings of the self. The coverings take place due to ignorance. Such coverings are never effective in the person of the Personality of Godhead. Knowing this convincingly is called liberation, or seeing the Absolute. This means that perfect self-realization is made possible by adoption of godly or spiritual life. Self-realization means becoming indifferent to the needs of the gross and subtle bodies and becoming serious about the activities of the self. The impetus for activities is generated from the self, but such activities become illusory due to ignorance of the real position of the self. By ignorance, self-interest is calculated in terms of the gross and subtle bodies, and therefore a whole set of activities is spoiled, life after life. When, however, one meets the self by proper culture, the activities of the self begin. Therefore a man who is engaged in the activities of the self is called <span class="Italic">j&#299;van-mukta,</span> or a liberated person even in the conditional existence.</div>
<div class="Purport">This perfect stage of self-realization is attained not by artificial means, but under the lotus feet of the Lord, who is always transcendental. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the Lord says that He is present in everyone's heart, and from Him only all knowledge, remembrance or forgetfulness take place. When the living being desires to be an enjoyer of material energy (illusory phenomena), the Lord covers the living being in the mystery of forgetfulness, and thus the living being misinterprets the gross body and subtle mind to be his own self. And by culture of transcendental knowledge, when the living being prays to the Lord for deliverance from the clutches of forgetfulness, the Lord, by His causeless mercy, removes the living being's illusory curtain, and thus he realizes his own self. He then engages himself in the service of the Lord in his eternal constitutional position, becoming liberated from the conditioned life. All this is executed by the Lord either through His external potency or directly by the internal potency.</div>

<div class="Translation">If the illusory energy subsides and the living entity becomes fully enriched with knowledge by the grace of the Lord, then he becomes at once enlightened with self-realization and thus becomes situated in his own glory.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Because the Lord is the absolute Transcendence, all of His forms, names, pastimes, attributes, associates and energies are identical with Him. His transcendental energy acts according to His omnipotency. The same energy acts as His external, internal and marginal energies, and by His omnipotency He can perform anything and everything through the agency of any of the above energies. He can turn the external energy into internal by His will. Therefore by His grace the external energy, which is employed in illusioning those living beings who want to have it, subsides by the will of the Lord in terms of repentance and penance for the conditioned soul. And the very same energy then acts to help the purified living being make progress on the path of self-realization. The example of electrical energy is very appropriate in this connection. The expert electrician can utilize the electrical energy for both heating and cooling by adjustment only. Similarly, the external energy, which now bewilders the living being into continuation of birth and death, is turned into internal potency by the will of the Lord to lead the living being to eternal life. When a living being is thus graced by the Lord, he is placed in his proper constitutional position to enjoy eternal spiritual life.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Both the Lord and the living entities are essentially all spiritual. Therefore both of them are eternal, and neither of them has birth and death. The difference is that the so-called births and disappearances of the Lord are unlike those of the living beings. The living beings who take birth and then again accept death are bound by the laws of material nature. But the so-called appearance and disappearance of the Lord are not actions of material nature, but are demonstrations of the internal potency of the Lord. They are described by the great sages for the purpose of self-realization. It is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> by the Lord that His so-called birth in the material world and His activities are all transcendental. And simply by meditation on such activities one can attain realization of Brahman and thus become liberated from material bondage. In the <span class="Italic">&#347;rutis</span> it is said that the birthless appears to take birth. The Supreme has nothing to do, but because He is omnipotent, everything is performed by Him naturally, as if done automatically. As a matter of fact, the appearance and disappearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His different activities are all confidential, even to the Vedic literatures. Yet they are displayed by the Lord to bestow mercy upon the conditioned souls. We should always take advantage of the narrations of the activities of the Lord, which are meditations on Brahman in the most convenient and palatable form.</div>

<div class="First">No one can properly describe the transcendental nature of the Absolute Truth. Therefore it is said that He is beyond the expression of mind and speech. And yet there are some men, with a poor fund of knowledge, who desire to understand the Absolute Truth by imperfect mental speculation and faulty description of His activities. To the layman His activities, appearance and disappearance, His names, His forms, His paraphernalia, His personalities and all things in relation with Him are mysterious. There are two classes of materialists, namely the fruitive workers and the empiric philosophers. The fruitive workers have practically no information of the Absolute Truth, and the mental speculators, after being frustrated in fruitive activities, turn their faces towards the Absolute Truth and try to know Him by mental speculation. And for all these men, the Absolute Truth is a mystery, as the jugglery of the magician is a mystery to children. Being deceived by the jugglery of the Supreme Being, the nondevotees, who may be very dexterous in fruitive work and mental speculation, are always in ignorance. With such limited knowledge, they are unable to penetrate into the mysterious region of transcendence. The mental speculators are a little more progressive than the gross materialists or the fruitive workers, but because they are also within the grip of illusion, they take it for granted that anything which has form, a name and activities is but a product of material energy. For them the Supreme Spirit is formless, nameless and inactive. And because such mental speculators equalize the transcendental name and form of the Lord with mundane names and form, they are in fact in ignorance. With such a poor fund of knowledge, there is no access to the real nature of the Supreme Being. As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> the Lord is always in a transcendental position, even when He is within the material world. But ignorant men consider the Lord one of the great personalities of the world, and thus they are misled by the illusory energy.</div>

The great <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is</span> like Vy&#257;sa had no business putting some imaginary stories in their literatures.</div>
<div class="Purport">In the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> historical facts selected from the histories of different planets have been depicted. It is therefore accepted by all the spiritual authorities as the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;-Pur&#257;&#7751;a.</span> The special significance of these histories is that they are all connected with activities of the Lord in a different time and atmosphere. &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; is the topmost personality of all the self-realized souls, and he accepted this as the subject of studies from his father, Vy&#257;sadeva. &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva is the great authority, and the subject matter of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> being so important, he delivered the message first to his great son &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;. It is compared to the cream of the milk. Vedic literature is like the milk ocean of knowledge. Cream or butter is the most palatable essence of milk, and so also is <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> for it contains all palatable, instructive and authentic versions of different activities of the Lord and His devotees. There is no gain, however, in accepting the message of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> from the unbelievers, atheists and professional reciters who make a trade of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> for the laymen. It was delivered to &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, and he had nothing to do with the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata</span> business. He did not have to maintain family expenses by such trade. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> should therefore be received from the representative of &#346;ukadeva, who must be in the renounced order of life without family encumbrance. Milk is undoubtedly very good and nourishing, but when it is touched by the mouth of a snake it is no longer nourishing; rather, it becomes a source of death. Similarly, those who are not strictly in the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava discipline should not make a business of this <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> and become a cause of spiritual death for so many hearers. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the Lord says that the purpose of all the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is to know Him (Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a), and <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself in the form of recorded knowledge. Therefore, it is the cream of all the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> and it contains all historical facts of all times in relation with &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. It is factually the essence of all histories.</div>

<div class="Translation">&#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, the son of Vy&#257;sadeva, in his turn delivered the Bh&#257;gavatam to the great Emperor Par&#299;k&#7779;it, who sat surrounded by sages on the bank of the Ganges, awaiting death without taking food or drink.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">All transcendental messages are received properly in the chain of disciplic succession. This disciplic succession is called <span class="Italic">parampar&#257;.</span> Unless therefore <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> or any other Vedic literatures are received through the <span class="Italic">parampar&#257;</span> system, the reception of knowledge is not bona fide. Vy&#257;sadeva delivered the message to &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, and from &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; received the message. One should therefore receive the message of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> from S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; or from his representative and not from any irrelevant interpreter.</div>
<div class="Purport">Emperor Par&#299;k&#7779;it received the information of his death in time, and he at once left his kingdom and family and sat down on the bank of the Ganges to fast till death. All great sages, <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is,</span> philosophers, mystics, etc., went there due to his imperial position. They offered many suggestions about his immediate duty, and at last it was settled that he would hear from &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; about Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Thus the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> was spoken to him.</div>
<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299;p&#257;da &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya, who preached M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da philosophy and stressed the impersonal feature of the Absolute, also recommended that one must take shelter at the lotus feet of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, for there is no hope of gain from debating. Indirectly &#346;r&#299;p&#257;da &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya admitted that what he had preached in the flowery grammatical interpretations of the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra</span> cannot help one at the time of death. At the critical hour of death one must recite the name of Govinda. This is the recommendation of all great transcendentalists. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; had long ago stated the same truth, that at the end one must remember N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. That is the essence of all spiritual activities. In pursuance of this eternal truth, <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> was heard by Emperor Par&#299;k&#7779;it, and it was recited by the able &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;. And both the speaker and the receiver of the messages of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> were duly delivered by the same medium.</div>

<div class="Translation">This Bh&#257;gavata Pur&#257;&#7751;a is as brilliant as the sun, and it has arisen just after the departure of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a to His own abode, accompanied by religion, knowledge, etc. Persons who have lost their vision due to the dense darkness of ignorance in the age of Kali shall get light from this Pur&#257;&#7751;a.<span class="Italic"></span></div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a has His eternal <span class="Italic">dh&#257;ma,</span> or abode, where He eternally enjoys Himself with His eternal associates and paraphernalia. And His eternal abode is a manifestation of His internal energy, whereas the material world is a manifestation of His external energy. When He descends on the material world, He displays Himself with all paraphernalia in His internal potency, which is called <span class="Italic">&#257;tma-m&#257;y&#257;.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the Lord says that He descends by His own potency (<span class="Italic">&#257;tma-m&#257;y&#257;</span>). His form, name, fame, paraphernalia, abode, etc., are not, therefore, creations of matter. He descends to reclaim the fallen souls and to reestablish codes of religion which are directly enacted by Him. Except for God, no one can establish the principles of religion. Either He or a suitable person empowered by Him can dictate the codes of religion. Real religion means to know God, our relation with Him and our duties in relation with Him and to know ultimately our destination after leaving this material body. The conditioned souls, who are entrapped by the material energy, hardly know all these principles of life. Most of them are like animals engaged in eating, sleeping, fearing and mating. They are mostly engaged in sense enjoyment under the pretension of religiosity, knowledge or salvation. They are still more blind in the present age of quarrel, or Kali-yuga. In the Kali-yuga the population is just a royal edition of the animals. They have nothing to do with spiritual knowledge or godly religious life. They are so blind that they cannot see anything beyond the jurisdiction of the subtle mind, intelligence or ego, but they are very much proud of their advancement in knowledge, science and material prosperity. They can risk their lives to become a dog or hog just after leaving the present body, for they have completely lost sight of the ultimate aim of life. The Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appeared before us just a little prior to the beginning of Kali-yuga, and He returned to His eternal home practically at the commencement of Kali-yuga. While He was present, He exhibited everything by His different activities. He spoke the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> specifically and eradicated all pretentious principles of religiosity. And prior to His departure from this material world, He empowered &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva through N&#257;rada to compile the messages of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> and thus both the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> are like torchbearers for the blind people of this age. In other words, if men in this age of Kali want to see the real light of life, they must take to these two books only, and their aim of life will be fulfilled. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> is the preliminary study of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> And <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the <span class="Italic">summum bonum</span> of life, Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a personified. We must therefore accept <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> as the direct representation of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. One who can see <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> can see also Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in person. They are identical.</div>

One cannot, however, learn <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> from a bogus hired reciter whose aim of life is to earn some money out of such recitation and employ the earning in sex indulgence. No one can learn <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> who is associated with persons engaged in sex life. That is the secret of learning <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> Nor can one learn <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> from one who interprets the text by his mundane scholarship. One has to learn <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> from the representative of &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, and no one else, if one at all wants to see Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in the pages. That is the process, and there is no alternative. S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; is a bona fide representative of &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; because he wants to present the message which he received from the great learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; presented <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> as he heard it from his great father, and so also S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; is presenting <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> as he had heard it from &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;. Simple hearing is not all; one must realize the text with proper attention. The word <span class="Italic">nivi&#7779;&#7789;a</span> means that S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; drank the juice of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> through his ears. That is the real process of receiving <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> One should hear with rapt attention from the real person, and then he can at once realize the presence of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in every page.

No one can be pure in action who is not pure in eating, sleeping, fearing and mating.

<div class="First">In a meeting of learned men, when there are congratulations or addresses for the speaker, the qualifications of the congratulator should be as follows. He must be the leader of the house and an elderly man.

<div class="First">S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; is twice addressed herein by &#346;aunaka Gosv&#257;m&#299; out of great joy because he and the members of the assembly were eager to hear the text of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> uttered by &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;. They were not interested in hearing it from a bogus person who would interpret in his own way to suit his own purpose. Generally the so-called <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> reciters are either professional readers or so-called learned impersonalists who cannot enter into the transcendental personal activities of the Supreme Person. Such impersonalists twist some meanings out of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> to suit and support impersonalist views, and the professional readers at once go to the Tenth Canto to misexplain the most confidential part of the Lord's pastimes. Neither of these reciters are bona fide persons to recite <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> Only one who is prepared to present <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> in the light of &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; and only those who are prepared to hear &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; and his representative are bona fide participants in the transcendental discussion of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span></div>

<div class="First">&#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was a liberated soul, and thus he remained always alert not to be trapped by the illusory energy. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> this alertness is very lucidly explained. The liberated soul and the conditioned soul have different engagements. The liberated soul is always engaged in the progressive path of spiritual attainment, which is something like a dream for the conditioned soul. The conditioned soul cannot imagine the actual engagements of the liberated soul. While the conditioned soul thus dreams about spiritual engagements, the liberated soul is awake. Similarly, the engagement of a conditioned soul appears to be a dream for the liberated soul. A conditioned soul and a liberated soul may apparently be on the same platform, but factually they are differently engaged, and their attention is always alert, either in sense enjoyment or in self-realization. The conditioned soul is absorbed in matter, whereas the liberated soul is completely indifferent to matter. This indifference is explained as follows.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">While &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva was following his son, beautiful young damsels who were bathing naked covered their bodies with cloth, although &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva himself was not naked. But they had not done so when his son had passed. The sage inquired about this, and the young ladies replied that his son was purified and when looking at them made no distinction between male and female. But the sage made such distinctions.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexdc6d.html?g=1961">5.18</a>) it is said that a learned sage looks equally on a learned and gentle <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> a <span class="Italic">ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la</span> (dog-eater), a dog or a cow due to his spiritual vision. &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; attained that stage. Thus he did not see a male or female; he saw all living entities in different dress. The ladies who were bathing could understand the mind of a man simply by studying his demeanor, just as by looking at a child one can understand how innocent he is. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was a young boy sixteen years old, and therefore all the parts of his body were developed. He was naked also, and so were the ladies. But because &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was transcendental to sex relations, he appeared very innocent. The ladies, by their special qualifications, could sense this at once, and therefore they were not very concerned about him. But when his father passed, the ladies quickly dressed. The ladies were exactly like his children or grandchildren, yet they reacted to the presence of Vy&#257;sadeva according to the social custom because &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva played the part of a householder. A householder has to distinguish between a male and female, otherwise he cannot be a householder. One should, therefore, attempt to know the distinction between spirit soul without any attachment for male and female. As long as such distinction is there, one should not try to become a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> like &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;. At least theoretically one must be convinced that a living entity is neither male nor female. The outward dress is made of matter by material nature to attract the opposite sex and thus keep one entangled in material existence. A liberated soul is above this perverted distinction. He does not distinguish between one living being and another. For him they are all one and the same spirit. The perfection of this spiritual vision is the liberated stage, and &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; attained that stage. &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva was also in the transcendental stage, but because he was in the householder's life, he did not pretend to be a liberated soul, as a matter of custom.</div>

<div class="Translation">Those who are devoted to the cause of the Personality of Godhead live only for the welfare, development and happiness of others. They do not live for any selfish interest. So even though the Emperor [Par&#299;k&#7779;it] was free from all attachment to worldly possessions, how could he give up his mortal body, which was shelter for others?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was an ideal king and householder because he was a devotee of the Personality of Godhead. A devotee of the Lord automatically has all good qualifications. And the Emperor was a typical example of this. Personally he had no attachment for all the worldly opulences in his possession. But since he was king for the all-around welfare of his citizens, he was always busy in the welfare work of the public, not only for this life, but also for the next. He would not allow slaughterhouses or killing of cows. He was not a foolish and partial administrator who would arrange for the protection of one living being and allow another to be killed. Because he was a devotee of the Lord, he knew perfectly well how to conduct his administration for everyone's happiness-men, animals, plants and all living creatures. He was not selfishly interested. Selfishness is either self-centered or self-extended. He was neither. His interest was to please the Supreme Truth Personality of Godhead. The king is the representative of the Supreme Lord, and therefore the king's interest must be identical with that of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord wants all living beings to be obedient to Him and thereby become happy. Therefore the king's interest is to guide all subjects back to the kingdom of God. Hence the activities of the citizens should be so coordinated that they can at the end go back home, back to Godhead. Under the administration of a representative king, the kingdom is full of opulence. At that time, human beings need not eat animals. There are ample food grains, milk, fruit and vegetables so that the human beings as well as the animals can eat sumptuously and to their heart's content. If all living beings are satisfied with food and shelter and obey the prescribed rules, there cannot be any disturbance between one living being and another. Emperor Par&#299;k&#7779;it was a worthy king, and therefore all were happy during his reign.</div>

<div class="First">The difference between the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and the <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> is like that between the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and the <span class="Italic">parivr&#257;jakas.</span> The <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are meant to administer some fruitive sacrifices mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> but the <span class="Italic">parivr&#257;jak&#257;c&#257;ryas,</span> or learned preachers, are meant to disseminate transcendental knowledge to one and all. As such, the <span class="Italic">parivr&#257;jak&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> are not always expert in pronouncing the Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras,</span> which are practiced systematically by accent and meter by the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> who are meant for administering Vedic rites. Yet it should not be considered that the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are more important than the itinerant preachers. They are one and different simultaneously because they are meant for the same end, in different ways.</div>
<div class="Purport">There is no difference also between the Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras</span> and what is explained in the <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> and <span class="Italic">Itih&#257;sa.</span> According to &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;, it is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">M&#257;dhyandina-&#347;ruti</span> that all the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> namely the <span class="Italic">S&#257;ma, Atharva, &#7770;g, Yajur, Pur&#257;&#7751;as, Itih&#257;sas, Upani&#7779;ads,</span> etc., are emanations from the breathing of the Supreme Being. The only difference is that the Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras</span> are mostly begun with <span class="Italic">pra&#7751;ava o&#7745;k&#257;ra,</span> and it requires some training to practice the metric pronunciation of the Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras.</span> But that does not mean that <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is of less importance than the Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras.</span> On the contrary, it is the ripened fruit of all the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> as stated before. Besides that, the most perfectly liberated soul, &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, is absorbed in the studies of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> although he is already self-realized. &#346;r&#299;la S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; is following his footsteps, and therefore his position is not the least less important because he was not expert in chanting Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras</span> with metric pronunciation, which depends more on practice than actual realization.

<div class="Translation">The great sage, who was fully equipped in knowledge, could see, through his transcendental vision, the deterioration of everything material, due to the influence of the age. He could also see that the faithless people in general would be reduced in duration of life and would be impatient due to lack of goodness. Thus he contemplated for the welfare of men in all statuses and orders of life.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The unmanifested forces of time are so powerful that they reduce all matter to oblivion in due course. In Kali-yuga, the last millennium of a round of four millenniums, the power of all material objects deteriorates by the influence of time. In this age the duration of the material body of the people in general is much reduced, and so is the memory. The action of matter has also not so much incentive. The land does not produce food grains in the same proportions as it did in other ages. The cow does not give as much milk as it used to give formerly. The production of vegetables and fruits is less than before. As such, all living beings, both men and animals, do not have sumptuous, nourishing food. Due to want of so many necessities of life, naturally the duration of life is reduced, the memory is short, intelligence is meager, mutual dealings are full of hypocrisy and so on.</div>
<div class="Purport">The great sage Vy&#257;sadeva could see this by his transcendental vision. As an astrologer can see the future fate of a man, or an astronomer can foretell the solar and lunar eclipses, those liberated souls who can see through the scriptures can foretell the future of all mankind. They can see this due to their sharp vision of spiritual attainment.</div>
<div class="Purport">And all such transcendentalists, who are naturally devotees of the Lord, are always eager to render welfare service to the people in general. They are the real friends of the people in general, not the so-called public leaders who are unable to see what is going to happen five minutes ahead. In this age the people in general as well as their so-called leaders are all unlucky fellows, faithless in spiritual knowledge and influenced by the age of Kali. They are always disturbed by various diseases. For example, in the present age there are so many TB patients and TB hospitals, but formerly this was not so because the time was not so unfavorable. The unfortunate men of this age are always reluctant to give a reception to the transcendentalists who are representatives of &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva and selfless workers always busy in planning something which may help everyone in all statuses and orders of life. The greatest philanthropists are those transcendentalists who represent the mission of Vy&#257;sa, N&#257;rada, Madhva, Caitanya, R&#363;pa, Sarasvat&#299;, etc. They are all one and the same. The personalities may be different, but the aim of the mission is one and the same, namely, to deliver the fallen souls back home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation">Thus the great sage Vy&#257;sadeva, who is very kind to the ignorant masses, edited the Vedas so they might be assimilated by less intellectual men.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The <span class="Italic">Veda</span> is one, and the reasons for its divisions in many parts are explained herewith. The seed of all knowledge, or the <span class="Italic">Veda,</span> is not a subject matter which can easily be understood by any ordinary man. There is a stricture that no one should try to learn the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> who is not a qualified <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> This stricture has been wrongly interpreted in so many ways. A class of men, who claim brahminical qualification simply by their birthright in the family of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> claim that the study of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is a monopoly of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> caste only. Another section of the people take this as an injustice to members of other castes, who do not happen to take birth in a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> family. But both of them are misguided. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are subjects which had to be explained even to Brahm&#257;j&#299; by the Supreme Lord. Therefore the subject matter is understood by persons with exceptional qualities of goodness. Persons who are in the modes of passion and ignorance are unable to understand the subject matter of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> The ultimate goal of Vedic knowledge is &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Personality of Godhead. This Personality is very rarely understood by those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance. In the Satya-yuga everyone was situated in the mode of goodness. Gradually the mode of goodness declined during the Tret&#257; and Dv&#257;para-yugas, and the general mass of people became corrupt. In the present age the mode of goodness is almost nil, and so for the general mass of people, the kindhearted, powerful sage &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva divided the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> in various ways so that they may be practically followed by less intelligent persons in the modes of passion and ignorance. It is explained in the next <span class="Italic">&#347;loka</span> as follows.</div>

<div class="Translation">Out of compassion, the great sage thought it wise that this would enable men to achieve the ultimate goal of life. Thus he compiled the great historical narration called the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata for women, laborers and friends of the twice-born.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"><JD:"Destination-97">The friends of the twice-born families are those who are born in the families of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as, k&#7779;atriyas</span> and <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas,</span> or the spiritually cultured families, but who themselves are not equal to their forefathers. Such descendants are not recognized as such, for want of purificatory achievements. The purificatory activities begin even before the birth of a child, and the seed-giving reformatory process is called <span class="Italic">Garbh&#257;dh&#257;na-sa&#7745;sk&#257;ra.</span> One who has not undergone such <span class="Italic">Garbh&#257;dh&#257;na-sa&#7745;sk&#257;ra,</span> or spiritual family planning, is not accepted as being of an actual twice-born family. The <span class="Italic">Garbh&#257;dh&#257;na-sa&#7745;sk&#257;ra</span> is followed by other purificatory processes, out of which the sacred thread ceremony is one. This is performed at the time of spiritual initiation. After this particular <span class="Italic">sa&#7745;sk&#257;ra,</span> one is rightly called twice-born. One birth is calculated during the seed-giving <span class="Italic">sa&#7745;sk&#257;ra,</span> and the second birth is calculated at the time of spiritual initiation. One who has been able to undergo such important <span class="Italic">sa&#7745;sk&#257;ras</span> can be called a bona fide twice-born.</div>
<div class="Purport">If the father and the mother do not undertake the process of spiritual family planning and simply beget children out of passion only, their children are called <span class="Italic">dvija-bandhus.</span> These <span class="Italic">dvija-bandhus</span> are certainly not as intelligent as the children of the regular twice-born families. The <span class="Italic">dvija-bandhus</span> are classified with the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> and the woman class, who are by nature less intelligent. The <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> and the woman class do not have to undergo any <span class="Italic">sa&#7745;sk&#257;ra</span> save and except the ceremony of marriage.</div>
<div class="Purport">The less intelligent classes of men, namely women, <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> and unqualified sons of the higher castes, are devoid of necessary qualifications to understand the purpose of the transcendental <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> For them the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> was prepared. The purpose of the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> is to administer the purpose of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> and therefore within this <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> the summary <span class="Italic">Veda</span> of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> is placed. The less intelligent are more interested in stories than in philosophy, and therefore the philosophy of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> in the form of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> is spoken by the Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Vy&#257;sadeva and Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a are both on the transcendental plane, and therefore they collaborated in doing good to the fallen souls of this age. The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> is the essence of all Vedic knowledge. It is the first book of spiritual values, as the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads</span> are. The Ved&#257;nta philosophy is the subject matter for study by the spiritual graduates. Only the post-graduate spiritual student can enter into the spiritual or devotional service of the Lord. It is a great science, and the great professor is the Lord Himself in the form of Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. And persons who are empowered by Him can initiate others in the transcendental loving service of the Lord.</div>

<div class="First">The vacuum felt by Vy&#257;sadeva was not due to his lack of knowledge. <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata-dharma</span> is purely devotional service of the Lord to which the monist has no access.

Although Vy&#257;sadeva was an empowered Divinity, he still felt dissatisfaction because in none of his works were the transcendental activities of the Lord properly explained. The inspiration was infused by &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a directly in the heart of Vy&#257;sadeva, and thus he felt the vacuum as explained above. It is definitely expressed herewith that without the transcendental loving service of the Lord, everything is void; but in the transcendental service of the Lord, everything is tangible without any separate attempt at fruitive work or empiric philosophical speculation.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The eternal relation of an individual soul with the Supreme Soul Personality of Godhead is constitutionally one of being the eternal servitor of the eternal master. The Lord has expanded Himself as living beings in order to accept loving service from them, and this alone can satisfy both the Lord and the living beings. Such a scholar as Vy&#257;sadeva has completed many expansions of the Vedic literatures, ending with the Ved&#257;nta philosophy, but none of them have been written directly glorifying the Personality of Godhead. Dry philosophical speculations even on the transcendental subject of the Absolute have very little attraction without directly dealing with the glorification of the Lord. The Personality of Godhead is the last word in transcendental realization. The Absolute realized as impersonal Brahman or localized Supersoul, Param&#257;tm&#257;, is less productive of transcendental bliss than the supreme personal realization of His glories.</div>
<div class="Purport">The compiler of the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-dar&#347;ana</span> is Vy&#257;sadeva himself. Yet he is troubled, although he is the author. So what sort of transcendental bliss can be derived by the readers and listeners of Ved&#257;nta which is not explained directly by Vy&#257;sadeva, the author?

<div class="Translation">Although, great sage, you have very broadly described the four principles beginning with religious performances, you have not described the glories of the Supreme Personality, V&#257;sudeva.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The prompt diagnosis of &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada is at once declared. The root cause of the despondency of Vy&#257;sadeva was his deliberate avoidance of glorifying the Lord in his various editions of the <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as.</span> He has certainly, as a matter of course, given descriptions of the glories of the Lord (&#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a) but not as many as given to religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and salvation. These four items are by far inferior to engagement in the devotional service of the Lord. &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva, as the authorized scholar, knew very well this difference. And still instead of giving more importance to the better type of engagement, namely, devotional service to the Lord, he had more or less improperly used his valuable time, and thus he was despondent. From this it is clearly indicated that no one can be pleased substantially without being engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> this fact is clearly mentioned.</div>
<div class="Purport">After liberation, which is the last item in the line of performing religiosity, etc., one is engaged in pure devotional service. This is called the stage of self-realization, or the <span class="Italic">brahma-bh&#363;ta</span> stage<span class="Italic"> </I>[</I>SB <a href="index2486.html?g=41459">4.30.20</a></I>]</span></I>. After attainment of this <span class="Italic">brahma-bh&#363;ta</span> stage, one is satisfied. But satisfaction is the beginning of transcendental bliss. One should progress by attaining neutrality and equality in the relative world. And passing this stage of equanimity, one is fixed in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. This is the instruction of the Personality of Godhead in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> The conclusion is that in order to maintain the status quo of the <span class="Italic">brahma-bh&#363;ta</span> stage, as also to increase the degree of transcendental realization, N&#257;rada recommended to Vy&#257;sadeva that he (Vy&#257;sadeva) should now eagerly and repeatedly describe the path of devotional service. This would cure him from gross despondency.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Those words which do not describe the glories of the Lord, who alone can sanctify the atmosphere of the whole universe, are considered by saintly persons to be like unto a place of pilgrimage for crows. Since the all-perfect persons are inhabitants of the transcendental abode, they do not derive any pleasure there.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Crows and swans are not birds of the same feather because of their different mental attitudes. The fruitive workers or passionate men are compared to the crows, whereas the all-perfect saintly persons are compared to the swans. The crows take pleasure in a place where garbage is thrown out, just as the passionate fruitive workers take pleasure in wine and woman and places for gross sense pleasure. The swans do not take pleasure in the places where crows are assembled for conferences and meetings. They are instead seen in the atmosphere of natural scenic beauty where there are transparent reservoirs of water nicely decorated with stems of lotus flowers in variegated colors of natural beauty. That is the difference between the two classes of birds.</div>
<div class="Purport">Nature has influenced different species of life with different mentalities, and it is not possible to bring them up into the same rank and file.</div>
<div class="Purport">Similarly, there are different kinds of literature for different types of men of different mentality. Mostly the market literatures which attract men of the crow's categories are literatures containing refused remnants of sensuous topics. They are generally known as mundane talks in relation with the gross body and subtle mind. They are full of subject matter described in decorative language full of mundane similes and metaphorical arrangements. Yet with all that, they do not glorify the Lord. Such poetry and prose, on any subject matter, is considered decoration of a dead body. Spiritually advanced men who are compared to the swans do not take pleasure in such dead literatures, which are sources of pleasure for men who are spiritually dead. These literatures in the modes of passion and ignorance are distributed under different labels, but they can hardly help the spiritual urge of the human being, and thus the swanlike spiritually advanced men have nothing to do with them. Such spiritually advanced men are called also <span class="Italic">m&#257;nasa</span> because they always keep up the standard of transcendental voluntary service to the Lord on the spiritual plane. This completely forbids fruitive activities for gross bodily sense satisfaction or subtle speculation of the material egoistic mind.</div>
<div class="Purport">Social literary men, scientists, mundane poets, theoretical philosophers and politicians who are completely absorbed in the material advancement of sense pleasure are all dolls of the material energy. They take pleasure in a place where rejected subject matters are thrown. According to Sv&#257;m&#299; &#346;r&#299;dhara, this is the pleasure of the prostitute-hunters.</div>
<div class="Purport">But literatures which describe the glories of the Lord are enjoyed by the <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sas</span> who have grasped the essence of human activities.</div>

<div class="Translation">On the other hand, that literature which is full of descriptions of the transcendental glories of the name, fame, forms, pastimes, etc., of the unlimited Supreme Lord is a different creation, full of transcendental words directed toward bringing about a revolution in the impious lives of this world's misdirected civilization. Such transcendental literatures, even though imperfectly composed, are heard, sung and accepted by purified men who are thoroughly honest.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">It is a qualification of the great thinkers to pick up the best even from the worst. It is said that the intelligent man should pick up nectar from a stock of poison, should accept gold even from a filthy place, should accept a good and qualified wife even from an obscure family and should accept a good lesson even from a man or from a teacher who comes from the untouchables. These are some of the ethical instructions for everyone in every place without exception. But a saint is far above the level of an ordinary man. He is always absorbed in glorifying the Supreme Lord because by broadcasting the holy name and fame of the Supreme Lord, the polluted atmosphere of the world will change, and as a result of propagating the transcendental literatures like <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> people will become sane in their transactions. While preparing this commentation on this particular stanza of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> we have a crisis before us. Our neighboring friend China has attacked the border of India with a militaristic spirit. We have practically no business in the political field, yet we see that previously there were both China and India, and they both lived peacefully for centuries without ill feeling. The reason is that they lived those days in an atmosphere of God consciousness, and every country, over the surface of the world, was God-fearing, pure-hearted and simple, and there was no question of political diplomacy. There is no cause of quarrel between the two countries China and India over land which is not very suitable for habitation, and certainly there is no cause for fighting on this issue. But due to the age of quarrel, Kali, which we have discussed, there is always a chance of quarrel on slight provocation. This is due not to the issue in question, but to the polluted atmosphere of this age: systematically there is propaganda by a section of people <span class="Italic">to stop glorification of the name and fame of the Supreme Lord.</span> Therefore, there is a great need for disseminating the message of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> all over the world. It is the duty of every responsible Indian to broadcast the transcendental message of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> throughout the world to do all the supermost good as well as to bring about the desired peace in the world. Because India has failed in her duty by neglecting this responsible work, there is so much quarrel and trouble all over the world. We are confident that if the transcendental message of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is received only by the leading men of the world, certainly there will be a change of heart, and naturally the people in general will follow them. The mass of people in general are tools in the hands of the modern politicians and leaders of the people. If there is a change of heart of the leaders only, certainly there will be a radical change in the atmosphere of the world. We know that our honest attempt to present this great literature conveying transcendental messages for reviving the God consciousness of the people in general and respiritualizing the world atmosphere is fraught with many difficulties. Our presenting this matter in adequate language, especially a foreign language, will certainly fail, and there will be so many literary discrepancies despite our honest attempt to present it in the proper way. But we are sure that with all our faults in this connection the seriousness of the subject matter will be taken into consideration, and the leaders of society will still accept this due to its being an honest attempt to glorify the Almighty God. When there is fire in a house, the inmates of the house go out to get help from the neighbors who may be foreigners, and yet without knowing the language the victims of the fire express themselves, and the neighbors understand the need, even though not expressed in the same language. The same spirit of cooperation is needed to broadcast this transcendental message of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> throughout the polluted atmosphere of the world. After all, it is a technical science of spiritual values, and thus we are concerned with the techniques and not with the language. If the techniques of this great literature are understood by the people of the world, there will be success.</div>
<div class="Purport">When there are too many materialistic activities by the people in general all over the world, there is no wonder that a person or a nation attacks another person or nation on slight provocation. That is the rule of this age of Kali or quarrel. The atmosphere is already polluted with corruption of all description, and everyone knows it well. There are so many unwanted literatures full of materialistic ideas of sense gratification. In many countries there are bodies appointed by the state to detect and censor obscene literature. This means that neither the government nor the responsible leaders of the public want such literature, yet it is in the marketplace because the people want it for sense gratification. The people in general want to read (that is a natural instinct), but because their minds are polluted they want such literatures. Under the circumstances, transcendental literature like <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> will not only diminish the activities of the corrupt mind of the people in general, but also it will supply food for their hankering after reading some interesting literature. In the beginning they may not like it because one suffering from jaundice is reluctant to take sugar candy, but we should know that sugar candy is the only remedy for jaundice. Similarly, let there be systematic propaganda for popularizing reading of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> which will act like sugar candy for the jaundicelike condition of sense gratification. When men have a taste for this literature, the other literatures, which are catering poison to society, will then automatically cease.</div>
<div class="Purport">We are sure, therefore, that everyone in human society will welcome <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> even though it is now presented with so many faults, for it is recommended by &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada, who has very kindly appeared in this chapter.</div>

Fruitive work, in which almost all people in general are engaged, is always painful either in the beginning or at the end. It can be fruitful only when made subservient to the devotional service of the Lord. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> also it is confirmed that the result of such fruitive work may be offered for the service of the Lord, otherwise it leads to material bondage. The bona fide enjoyer of the fruitive work is the Personality of Godhead, and thus when it is engaged for the sense gratification of the living beings, it becomes an acute source of trouble.</div>

<div class="Translation">O Vy&#257;sadeva, your vision is completely perfect. Your good fame is spotless. You are firm in vow and situated in truthfulness. And thus you can think of the pastimes of the Lord in trance for the liberation of the people in general from all material bondage.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">People in general have a taste for literatures by instinct. They want to hear and read from the authorities something about the unknown, but their taste is exploited by unfortunate literatures which are full of subject matter for satisfaction of the material senses. Such literatures contain different kinds of mundane poems and philosophical speculations, more or less under the influence of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> ending in sense gratification. These literatures, although worthless in the true sense of the term, are variously decorated to attract the attention of the less intelligent men. Thus the attracted living entities are more and more entangled in material bondage without hope of liberation for thousands and thousands of generations. &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada &#7770;&#7779;i, being the best amongst the Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas, is compassionate toward such unfortunate victims of worthless literatures, and thus he advises &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva to compose transcendental literature which is not only attractive but can also actually bring liberation from all kinds of bondage. &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva or his representatives are qualified because they are rightly trained to see things in true perspective. &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva and his representatives are pure in thought due to their spiritual enlightenment, fixed in their vows due to their devotional service, and determined to deliver the fallen souls rotting in material activities. The fallen souls are very eager to receive novel informations every day, and the transcendentalists like Vy&#257;sadeva or N&#257;rada can supply such eager people in general with unlimited news from the spiritual world. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is said that the material world is only a part of the whole creation and that this earth is only a fragment of the whole material world.</div>
<div class="Purport">There are thousands and thousands of literary men all over the world, and they have created many, many thousands of literary works for the information of the people in general for thousands and thousands of years. Unfortunately none of them have brought peace and tranquillity on the earth. This is due to a spiritual vacuum in those literatures; therefore the Vedic literatures, especially the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> are specifically recommended to suffering humanity to bring about the desired effect of liberation from the pangs of material civilization, which is eating the vital part of human energy. The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> is the spoken message of the Lord Himself recorded by Vy&#257;sadeva, and the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the transcendental narration of the activities of the same Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, which alone can satisfy the hankering desires of the living being for eternal peace and liberation from miseries. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> therefore, is meant for all the living beings all over the universe for total liberation from all kinds of material bondage. Such transcendental narrations of the pastimes of the Lord can be described only by liberated souls like Vy&#257;sadeva and his bona fide representatives who are completely merged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Only to such devotees do the pastimes of the Lord and their transcendental nature become automatically manifest by dint of devotional service. No one else can either know or describe the acts of the Lord, even if they speculate on the subject for many, many years. The descriptions of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> are so precise and accurate that whatever has been predicted in this great literature about five thousand years ago is now exactly happening. Therefore, the vision of the author comprehends past, present and future. Such liberated persons as Vy&#257;sadeva are perfect not only by the power of vision and wisdom, but also in aural reception, in thinking, feeling and all other sense activities. A liberated person possesses perfect senses, and with perfect senses only can one serve the sense-proprietor, H&#7771;&#7779;&#299;ke&#347;a, &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a the Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> therefore, is the perfect description of the all-perfect Personality of Godhead by the all-perfect personality &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva, the compiler of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>

<div class="Translation">Whatever you desire to describe that is separate in vision from the Lord simply reacts, with different forms, names and results, to agitate the mind as the wind agitates a boat which has no resting place.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">&#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva is the editor of all descriptions of the Vedic literatures, and thus he has described transcendental realization in different ways, namely by fruitive activities, speculative knowledge, mystic power and devotional service. Besides that, in his various <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> he has recommended the worship of so many demigods in different forms and names. The result is that people in general are puzzled how to fix their minds in the service of the Lord; they are always disturbed about finding the real path of self-realization. &#346;r&#299;la N&#257;radadeva is stressing this particular defect in the Vedic literatures compiled by Vy&#257;sadeva, and thus he is trying to emphasize describing everything in relation with the Supreme Lord, and no one else. In fact, there is nothing existent except the Lord. The Lord is manifested in different expansions. He is the root of the complete tree. He is the stomach of the complete body. pouring water on the root is the right process to water the tree, as much as feeding the stomach supplies energy to all parts of the body. Therefore, &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva should not have compiled any <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> other than the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> because a slight deviation from that may create havoc for self-realization. If a slight deviation can create such havoc, then what to speak of deliberate expansion of the ideas separate from the Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead. The most defective part of worshiping demigods is that it creates a definite conception of pantheism, ending disastrously in many religious sects detrimental to the progress of the principles of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> which alone can give the accurate direction for self-realization in eternal relation with the Personality of Godhead by devotional service in transcendental love. The example of the boat disturbed by whirling wind is suitable in this respect. The diverted mind of the pantheist can never reach the perfection of self-realization, due to the disturbed condition of the selection of object.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">The people in general are naturally inclined to enjoy, and you have encouraged them in that way in the name of religion. This is verily condemned and is quite unreasonable. Because they are guided under your instructions, they will accept such activities in the name of religion and will hardly care for prohibitions.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">&#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva's compilation of different Vedic literatures on the basis of regulated performances of fruitive activities as depicted in the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> and other literature is condemned herewith by &#346;r&#299;la N&#257;rada. The human beings, by long material association, life after life, have a natural inclination, by practice, to endeavor to lord it over material energy. They have no sense of the responsibility of human life. This human form of life is a chance to get out of the clutches of illusory matter. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are meant for going back to Godhead, going back home. To revolve in the cycle of transmigration in a series of lives numbering 8,400,000 is an imprisoned life for the condemned conditioned souls. The human form of life is a chance to get out of this imprisoned life, and as such the only occupation of the human being is to reestablish his lost relationship with God. Under the circumstances, one should never be encouraged in making a plan for sense enjoyment in the name of religious functions. Such diversion of the human energy results in a misguided civilization. &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva is the authority in Vedic explanations in the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata,</span> etc., and his encouragement in sense enjoyment in some form or other is a great barrier for spiritual advancement because the people in general will not agree to renounce material activities which held them in material bondage. At a certain stage of human civilization when such material activities in the name of religion (as sacrificing animals in the name of <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a</span>) were too much rampant, the Lord incarnated Himself as Buddha and decried the authority of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> in order to stop animal sacrifice in the name of religion. This was foreseen by N&#257;rada, and therefore he condemned such literatures. The flesh-eaters still continue to perform animal sacrifice before some demigod or goddess in the name of religion because in some of the Vedic literatures such regulated sacrifices are recommended. They are so recommended to discourage flesh-eating, but gradually the purpose of such religious activities is forgotten, and the slaughterhouse becomes prominent. This is because foolish materialistic men do not care to listen to others who are actually in a position to explain the Vedic rites.</div>
<div class="Purport">In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> it is distinctly said that the perfection of life is never to be attained either by voluminous work, or by accumulation of wealth or even by increasing the population. But it is so attained only by renunciation. The materialistic men do not care to listen to such injunctions. According to them, the so-called renounced order of life is meant for those who are unable to earn their livelihood because of some corporeal defects, or for persons who have failed to achieve prosperity in family life.</div>
<div class="Purport">In histories like the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata,</span> of course, there are topics on transcendental subjects along with material topics. The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> is there in the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata.</span> The whole idea of the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> culminates in the ultimate instructions of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> that one should relinquish all other engagements and should engage oneself solely and fully in surrendering unto the lotus feet of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. But men with materialistic tendencies are more attracted to the politics, economics and philanthropic activities mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> than to the principal topic, namely the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> This compromising spirit of Vy&#257;sadeva is directly condemned by N&#257;rada, who advises him to directly proclaim that the prime necessity of human life is to realize one's eternal relation with the Lord and thus surrender unto Him without delay.</div>
<div class="Purport">A patient suffering from a particular type of malady is almost always inclined to accept eatables which are forbidden for him. The expert physician does not make any compromise with the patient by allowing him to take partially what he should not at all take. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is also said that a man attached to fruitive work should not be discouraged from his occupation, for gradually he may be elevated to the position of self-realization. This is sometimes applicable for those who are only dry empiric philosophers without spiritual realization. But those who are in the devotional line need not be always so advised.</div>

<div class="Translation">The Supreme Lord is unlimited. Only a very expert personality, retired from the activities of material happiness, deserves to understand this knowledge of spiritual values. Therefore those who are not so well situated, due to material attachment, should be shown the ways of transcendental realization, by Your Goodness, through descriptions of the transcendental activities of the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Theological science is a difficult subject, especially when it deals with the transcendental nature of God. It is not a subject matter to be understood by persons who are too much attached to material activities. Only the very expert, who have almost retired from materialistic activities by culture of spiritual knowledge, can be admitted to the study of this great science. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is clearly stated that out of many hundreds and thousands of men only one person deserves to enter into transcendental realization. And out of many thousands of such transcendentally realized persons, only a few can understand the theological science specifically dealing with God as a person. &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva is therefore advised by N&#257;rada to describe the science of God directly by relating His transcendental activities. Vy&#257;sadeva is himself a personality expert in this science, and he is unattached to material enjoyment. Therefore he is the right person to describe it, and &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, the son of Vy&#257;sadeva, is the right person to receive it.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the topmost theological science, and therefore it can react on the laymen as medicinal doses. Because it contains the transcendental activities of the Lord, there is no difference between the Lord and the literature. The literature is the factual literary incarnation of the Lord. So the laymen can hear the narration of the activities of the Lord. Thereby they are able to associate with the Lord and thus gradually become purified from material diseases. The expert devotees also can discover novel ways and means to convert the nondevotees in terms of particular time and circumstance. Devotional service is dynamic activity, and the expert devotees can find out competent means to inject it into the dull brains of the materialistic population. Such transcendental activities of the devotees for the service of the Lord can bring a new order of life to the foolish society of materialistic men. Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu and His subsequent followers exhibited expert dexterity in this connection. By following the same method, one can bring the materialistic men of this age of quarrel into order for peaceful life and transcendental realization.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">One who has forsaken his material occupations to engage in the devotional service of the Lord may sometimes fall down while in an immature stage, yet there is no danger of his being unsuccessful. On the other hand, a nondevotee, though fully engaged in occupational duties, does not gain anything.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">As far as the duties of mankind are concerned, there are innumerable duties. Every man is duty-bound not only to his parents, family members, society, country, humanity, other living beings, the demigods, etc., but also to the great philosophers, poets, scientists, etc. It is enjoined in the scriptures that one can relinquish all such duties and surrender unto the service of the Lord. So if one does so and becomes successful in the discharge of his devotional service unto the Lord, it is well and good. But it so happens sometimes that one surrenders himself unto the service of the Lord by some temporary sentiment, and in the long run, due to so many other reasons, he falls down from the path of service by undesirable association. There are so many instances of this in the histories. Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was obliged to take his birth as a stag due to his intimate attachment to a stag. He thought of this stag when he died. As such, in the next birth he became a stag, although he did not forget the incident of his previous birth. Similarly, Citraketu also fell down due to his offenses at the feet of &#346;iva. But in spite of all this, the stress is given here to surrendering unto the lotus feet of the Lord, even if there is a chance of falling down, because even though one falls down from the prescribed duties of devotional service, he will never forget the lotus feet of the Lord. Once engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, one will continue the service in all circumstances. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is said that even a small quantity of devotional service can save one from the most dangerous position. There are many instances of such examples in history. Aj&#257;mila is one of them. Aj&#257;mila in his early life was a devotee, but in his youth he fell down. Still he was saved by the Lord at the end.</div>

<div class="Translation">Persons who are actually intelligent and philosophically inclined should endeavor only for that purposeful end which is not obtainable even by wandering from the topmost planet [Brahmaloka] down to the lowest planet [P&#257;t&#257;la]. As far as happiness derived from sense enjoyment is concerned, it can be obtained automatically in course of time, just as in course of time we obtain miseries even though we do not desire them.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Every man everywhere is trying to obtain the greatest amount of sense enjoyment by various endeavors. Some men are busy engaged in trade, industry, economic development, political supremacy, etc., and some of them are engaged in fruitive work to become happy in the next life by attaining higher planets. It is said that on the moon the inhabitants are fit for greater sense enjoyment by drinking <span class="Italic">soma-rasa,</span> and the Pit&#7771;loka is obtained by good charitable work. So there are various programs for sense enjoyment, either during this life or in the life after death. Some are trying to reach the moon or other planets by some mechanical arrangement, for they are very anxious to get into such planets without doing good work. But it is not to happen. By the law of the Supreme, different places are meant for different grades of living beings according to the work they have performed. By good work only, as prescribed in the scriptures, can one obtain birth in a good family, opulence, good education and good bodily features. We see also that even in this life one obtains a good education or money by good work. Similarly, in our next birth we get such desirable positions only by good work. Otherwise, it would not so happen that two persons born in the same place at the same time are seen differently placed according to previous work. But all such material positions are impermanent. The positions in the topmost Brahmaloka and in the lowest P&#257;t&#257;la are also changeable according to our own work. The philosophically inclined person must not be tempted by such changeable positions. He should try to get into the permanent life of bliss and knowledge where he will not be forced to come back again to the miserable material world, either in this or that planet. Miseries and mixed happiness are two features of material life, and they are obtained in Brahmaloka and in other <span class="Italic">lokas</span> also. They are obtained in the life of the demigods and also in the life of the dogs and hogs. The miseries and mixed happiness of all living beings are only of different degree and quality, but no one is free from the miseries of birth, death, old age and disease. Similarly, everyone has his destined happiness also. No one can get more or less of these things simply by personal endeavors. Even if they are obtained, they can be lost again. One should not, therefore, waste time with these flimsy things; one should only endeavor to go back to Godhead. That should be the mission of everyone's life.</div>

<div class="Translation">My dear Vy&#257;sa, even though a devotee of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a sometimes falls down somehow or other, he certainly does not undergo material existence like others [fruitive workers, etc.] because a person who has once relished the taste of the lotus feet of the Lord can do nothing but remember that ecstasy again and again.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">A devotee of the Lord automatically becomes uninterested in the enchantment of material existence because he is <span class="Italic">rasa-graha,</span> or one who has tasted the sweetness of the lotus feet of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. There are certainly many instances where devotees of the Lord have fallen down due to uncongenial association, just like fruitive workers, who are always prone to degradation. But even though he falls down, a devotee is never to be considered the same as a fallen <span class="Italic">karm&#299;.</span> A <span class="Italic">karm&#299;</span> suffers the result of his own fruitive reactions, whereas a devotee is reformed by chastisement directed by the Lord Himself. The sufferings of an orphan and the sufferings of a beloved child of a king are not one and the same. An orphan is really poor because he has no one to take care of him, but a beloved son of a rich man, although he appears to be on the same level as the orphan, is always under the vigilance of his capable father. A devotee of the Lord, due to wrong association, sometimes imitates the fruitive workers. The fruitive workers want to lord it over the material world. Similarly, a neophyte devotee foolishly thinks of accumulating some material power in exchange for devotional service. Such foolish devotees are sometimes put into difficulty by the Lord Himself. As a special favor, He may remove all material paraphernalia. By such action, the bewildered devotee is forsaken by all friends and relatives, and so he comes to his senses again by the mercy of the Lord and is set right to execute his devotional service.</div>
<div class="Purport">In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is also said that such fallen devotees are given a chance to take birth in a family of highly qualified <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> or in a rich mercantile family. A devotee in such a position is not as fortunate as one who is chastised by the Lord and put into a position seemingly of helplessness. The devotee who becomes helpless by the will of the Lord is more fortunate than those who are born in good families. The fallen devotees born in a good family may forget the lotus feet of the Lord because they are less fortunate, but the devotee who is put into a forlorn condition is more fortunate because he swiftly returns to the lotus feet of the Lord, thinking himself helpless all around.</div>
<div class="Purport">Pure devotional service is so spiritually relishable that a devotee becomes automatically uninterested in material enjoyment. That is the sign of perfection in progressive devotional service. A pure devotee continuously remembers the lotus feet of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and does not forget Him even for a moment, not even in exchange for all the opulence of the three worlds.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">The Supreme Lord Personality of Godhead is Himself this cosmos, and still He is aloof from it. From Him only has this cosmic manifestation emanated, in Him it rests, and unto Him it enters after annihilation. Your good self knows all about this. I have given only a synopsis.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">For a pure devotee, the conception of Mukunda, Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, is both personal and impersonal. The impersonal cosmic situation is also Mukunda because it is the emanation of the energy of Mukunda. For example, a tree is a complete unit, whereas the leaves and the branches of the tree are emanated parts and parcels of the tree. The leaves and branches of the tree are also the tree, but the tree itself is neither the leaves nor the branches. The Vedic version that the whole cosmic creation is nothing but Brahman means that since everything is emanating from the Supreme Brahman, nothing is apart from Him. Similarly, the part and parcel hands and legs are called the body, but the body as the whole unit is neither the hands nor the legs. The Lord is the transcendental form of eternity, cognition and beauty. And thus the creation of the energy of the Lord appears to be partially eternal, full of knowledge and beautiful also. The captivated conditioned souls under the influence of the external energy, <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> are therefore entrapped in the network of the material nature. They accept this as all in all, for they have no information of the Lord who is the primeval cause. Nor have they information that the parts and parcels of the body, being detached from the whole body, are no longer the same hand or leg as when attached to the body. Similarly, a godless civilization detached from the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is just like a detached hand or leg. Such parts and parcels may appear like hands and legs, but they have no efficiency. The devotee of the Lord, &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva, knows this very well. He is further advised by &#346;r&#299;la N&#257;rada to expand the idea so that the entrapped conditioned souls may take lessons from him to understand the Supreme Lord as the primeval cause.</div>
<div class="Purport">According to the Vedic version, the Lord is naturally fully powerful, and thus His supreme energies are always perfect and identical with Him. Both the spiritual and the material skies and their paraphernalia are emanations of the internal and external energies of the Lord. External energy is comparatively inferior, whereas the internal potency is superior. The superior energy is living force, and therefore she is completely identical, but the external energy, being inert, is partially identical. But both the energies are neither equal to nor greater than the Lord, who is the generator of all energies; such energies are always under His control, exactly as electrical energy, however powerful it may be, is always under the control of the engineer.</div>
<div class="Purport">The human being and all other living beings are products of His internal energies. Thus the living being is also identical with the Lord. But he is never equal or superior to the Personality of Godhead. The Lord and living beings are all individual persons. With the help of the material energies the living beings are also creating something, but none of their creations are equal or superior to the creations of the Lord. The human being may create a small playful sputnik and may throw it into outer space, but that does not mean that he can create a planet like the earth or moon and float it in the air as the Lord does. Men with a poor fund of knowledge claim to be equal to the Lord. They are never equal to the Lord. This is never to be. The human being, after attaining complete perfection, may achieve a large percentage of the qualities of the Lord (say up to seventy-eight percent), but it is never possible to surpass the Lord or to become equal with Him. In a diseased condition only, the foolish being claims to be one with the Lord and thus becomes misled by the illusory energy. The misguided living beings, therefore, must accept the supremacy of the Lord and agree to render loving service to Him. For this they have been created. Without this, there cannot be any peace or tranquillity in the world. &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva is advised by &#346;r&#299;la N&#257;rada to expand this idea in the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> also the same idea is explained: surrender fully unto the lotus feet of the Lord. That is the only business of the perfect human being.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Learned circles have positively concluded that the infallible purpose of the advancement of knowledge, namely austerities, study of the Vedas, sacrifice, chanting of hymns and charity, culminates in the transcendental descriptions of the Lord, who is defined in choice poetry.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Human intellect is developed for advancement of learning in art, science, philosophy, physics, chemistry, psychology, economics, politics, etc. By culture of such knowledge the human society can attain perfection of life. This perfection of life culminates in the realization of the Supreme Being, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. The <span class="Italic">&#347;ruti</span> therefore directs that those who are actually advanced in learning should aspire for the service of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Unfortunately persons who are enamored by the external beauty of <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-m&#257;y&#257;</span> do not understand that culmination of perfection or self-realization depends on Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. <span class="Italic">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u-m&#257;y&#257;</span> means sense enjoyment, which is transient and miserable. Those who are entrapped by <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-m&#257;y&#257;</span> utilize advancement of knowledge for sense enjoyment. &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada Muni has explained that all paraphernalia of the cosmic universe is but an emanation from the Lord out of His different energies because the Lord has set in motion, by His inconceivable energy, the actions and reactions of the created manifestation. They have come to be out of His energy, they rest on His energy, and after annihilation they merge into Him. Nothing is, therefore, different from Him, but at the same time the Lord is always different from them.</div>
<div class="Purport">When advancement of knowledge is applied in the service of the Lord, the whole process becomes absolute. The Personality of Godhead and His transcendental name, fame, glory, etc., are all nondifferent from Him. Therefore, all the sages and devotees of the Lord have recommended that the subject matter of art, science, philosophy, physics, chemistry, psychology and all other branches of knowledge should be wholly and solely applied in the service of the Lord. Art, literature, poetry, painting, etc., may be used in glorifying the Lord. The fiction writers, poets and celebrated litterateurs are generally engaged in writing of sensuous subjects, but if they turn towards the service of the Lord they can describe the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. V&#257;lm&#299;ki was a great poet, and similarly Vy&#257;sadeva is a great writer, and both of them have absolutely engaged themselves in delineating the transcendental activities of the Lord and by doing so have become immortal. Similarly, science and philosophy also should be applied in the service of the Lord. There is no use presenting dry speculative theories for sense gratification. philosophy and science should be engaged to establish the glory of the Lord. Advanced people are eager to understand the Absolute Truth through the medium of science, and therefore a great scientist should endeavor to prove the existence of the Lord on a scientific basis. Similarly, philosophical speculations should be utilized to establish the Supreme Truth as sentient and all-powerful. Similarly, all other branches of knowledge should always be engaged in the service of the Lord. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> also the same is affirmed. All "knowledge" not engaged in the service of the Lord is but nescience. Real utilization of advanced knowledge is to establish the glories of the Lord, and that is the real import. Scientific knowledge engaged in the service of the Lord and all similar activities are all factually <span class="Italic">hari-k&#299;rtana,</span> or glorification of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The wonder of an atmosphere surcharged with devotional service to the Lord is briefly described herein by &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada Muni. He was the son of the most insignificant parentage. He was not properly educated. Still, because his complete energy was engaged in the service of the Lord, he became an immortal sage. Such is the powerful action of devotional service. The living entities are the marginal energy of the Lord, and therefore they are meant for being properly utilized in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. When this is not done, one's situation is called <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> Therefore the illusion of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> is at once dissipated as soon as one's full energy is converted in the service of the Lord instead of in sense enjoyment. From the personal example of &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada Muni in his previous birth, it is clear that the service of the Lord begins with the service of the Lord's bona fide servants. The Lord says that the service of His servants is greater than His personal service. Service of the devotee is more valuable than the service of the Lord. One should therefore choose a bona fide servant of the Lord constantly engaged in His service, accept such a servant as the spiritual master and engage himself in his (the spiritual master's) service. Such a spiritual master is the transparent medium by which to visualize the Lord, who is beyond the conception of the material senses. By service of the bona fide spiritual master, the Lord consents to reveal Himself in proportion to the service rendered. Utilization of the human energy in the service of the Lord is the progressive path of salvation. The whole cosmic creation becomes at once identical with the Lord as soon as service in relation with the Lord is rendered under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master. The expert spiritual master knows the art of utilizing everything to glorify the Lord, and therefore under his guidance the whole world can be turned into the spiritual abode by the divine grace of the Lord's servant.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Although they were impartial by nature, those followers of the Ved&#257;nta blessed me with their causeless mercy. As far as I was concerned, I was self-controlled and had no attachment for sports, even though I was a boy. In addition, I was not naughty, and I did not speak more than required.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the Lord says, "All the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are searching after Me." Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya says that in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> the subject matters are only three, namely to establish the relation of the living entities with the Personality of Godhead, perform the relative duties in devotional service and thus achieve the ultimate goal, back to Godhead. As such, <span class="Italic">ved&#257;nta-v&#257;d&#299;s,</span> or the followers of the Ved&#257;nta, indicate the pure devotees of the Personality of Godhead. Such <span class="Italic">ved&#257;nta-v&#257;d&#299;s,</span> or the <span class="Italic">bhakti-ved&#257;ntas,</span> are impartial in distributing the transcendental knowledge of devotional service. To them no one is enemy or friend; no one is educated or uneducated. No one is especially favorable, and no one is unfavorable. The <span class="Italic">bhakti-ved&#257;ntas</span> see that the people in general are wasting time in false sensuous things. Their business is to get the ignorant mass of people to reestablish their lost relationship with the Personality of Godhead. By such endeavor, even the most forgotten soul is roused up to the sense of spiritual life, and thus being initiated by the <span class="Italic">bhakti-ved&#257;ntas,</span> the people in general gradually progress on the path of transcendental realization. So the <span class="Italic">ved&#257;nta-v&#257;d&#299;s</span> initiated the boy even before he became self-controlled and was detached from childish sporting, etc. But before the initiation, he (the boy) became more and more advanced in discipline, which is very essential for one who wishes to make progress in the line. In the system of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma,</span> which is the beginning of actual human life, small boys after five years of age are sent to become <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> at the <span class="Italic">guru's &#257;&#347;rama,</span> where these things are systematically taught to boys, be they king's sons or sons of ordinary citizens. The training was compulsory not only to create good citizens of the state, but also to prepare the boy's future life for spiritual realization. The irresponsible life of sense enjoyment was unknown to the children of the followers of the <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</span> system. The boy was even injected with spiritual acumen before being placed by the father in the womb of the mother. Both the father and the mother were responsible for the boy's success in being liberated from the material bondage. That is the process of successful family planning. It is to beget children for complete perfection. Without being self-controlled, without being disciplined and without being fully obedient, no one can become successful in following the instructions of the spiritual master, and without doing so, no one is able to go back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation">Once only, by their permission, I took the remnants of their food, and by so doing all my sins were at once eradicated. Thus being engaged, I became purified in heart, and at that time the very nature of the transcendentalist became attractive to me.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Pure devotion is as much infectious, in a good sense, as infectious diseases. A pure devotee is cleared from all kinds of sins. The Personality of Godhead is the purest entity, and unless one is equally pure from the infection of material qualities, one cannot become a pure devotee of the Lord. The <span class="Italic">bhakti-ved&#257;ntas</span> as above mentioned were pure devotees, and the boy became infected with their qualities of purity by their association and by eating once the remnants of the foodstuff taken by them. Such remnants may be taken even without permission of the pure devotees. There are sometimes pseudo-devotees, and one should be very much cautious about them. There are many things which hinder one from entering devotional service. But by the association of pure devotees all these obstacles are removed. The neophyte devotee becomes practically enriched with the transcendental qualities of the pure devotee, which means attraction for the Personality of Godhead's name, fame, quality, pastimes, etc. Infection of the qualities of the pure devotee means to imbibe the taste of pure devotion always in the transcendental activities of the Personality of Godhead. This transcendental taste at once makes all material things distasteful. Therefore a pure devotee is not at all attracted by material activities. After the elimination of all sins or obstacles on the path of devotional service, one can become attracted, one can have steadiness, one can have perfect taste, one can have transcendental emotions, and at last one can be situated on the plane of loving service of the Lord. All these stages develop by the association of pure devotees, and that is the purport of this stanza.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">O Vy&#257;sadeva, in that association and by the mercy of those great Ved&#257;ntists, I could hear them describe the attractive activities of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a And thus listening attentively, my taste for hearing of the Personality of Godhead increased at every step.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, is attractive not only in His personal features, but also in His transcendental activities. It is so because the Absolute is absolute by His name, fame, form, pastimes, entourage, paraphernalia, etc. The Lord descends on this material world out of His causeless mercy and displays His various transcendental pastimes as a human being so that human beings attracted towards Him become able to go back to Godhead. Men are naturally apt to hear histories and narrations of various personalities performing mundane activities, without knowing that by such association one simply wastes valuable time and also becomes addicted to the three qualities of mundane nature. Instead of wasting time, one can get spiritual success by turning his attention to the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. By hearing the narration of the pastimes of the Lord, one contacts directly the Personality of Godhead, and, as explained before, by hearing about the Personality of Godhead, from within, all accumulated sins of the mundane creature are cleared. Thus being cleared of all sins, the hearer gradually becomes liberated from mundane association and becomes attracted to the features of the Lord. N&#257;rada Muni has just explained this by his personal experience. The whole idea is that simply by hearing about the Lord's pastimes one can become one of the associates of the Lord. N&#257;rada Muni has eternal life, unlimited knowledge and unfathomed bliss, and he can travel all over the material and spiritual worlds without restriction. One can attain to the highest perfection of life simply by attentive hearing of the transcendental pastimes of the Lord from the right sources, as &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada heard them from the pure devotees (<span class="Italic">bhakti-ved&#257;ntas</span>) in his previous life. This process of hearing in the association of the devotees is especially recommended in this age of quarrel (Kali).</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">O great sage, as soon as I got a taste for the Personality of Godhead, my attention to hear of the Lord was unflinching. And as my taste developed, I could realize that it was only in my ignorance that I had accepted gross and subtle coverings, for both the Lord and I are transcendental.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Ignorance in material existence is compared to darkness, and in all Vedic literatures the Personality of Godhead is compared to the sun. Wherever there is light there cannot be darkness. Hearing of the Lord's pastimes is itself transcendental association with the Lord because there is no difference between the Lord and His transcendental pastimes. To become associated with the supreme light is to dissipate all ignorance. By ignorance only, the conditioned soul wrongly thinks that both he and the Lord are products of material nature. But in fact the Personality of Godhead and the living beings are transcendental, and they have nothing to do with the material nature. When ignorance is removed and it is perfectly realized that there is nothing existing without the Personality of Godhead, then nescience is removed. Since the gross and subtle bodies are emanations from the Personality of Godhead, the knowledge of light permits one to engage both of them in the service of the Lord. The gross body should be engaged in acts of rendering service to the Lord (as in bringing water, cleansing the temple or making obeisances, etc.). The path of <span class="Italic">arcan&#257;,</span> or worshiping the Lord in the temple, involves engaging one's gross body in the service of the Lord. Similarly, the subtle mind should be engaged in hearing the transcendental pastimes of the Lord, thinking about them, chanting His name, etc. All such activities are transcendental. None of the gross or subtle senses should otherwise be engaged. Such realization of transcendental activities is made possible by many, many years of apprenticeship in the devotional service, but simply attraction of love for the Personality of Godhead, as it was developed in N&#257;rada Muni, by hearing, is highly effective.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Transcendental loving service for the Supreme Lord is the natural inclination of every living being. The instinct is dormant in everyone, but due to the association of material nature the modes of passion and ignorance cover this from time immemorial. If, by the grace of the Lord and the great-souled devotees of the Lord, a living being becomes fortunate enough to associate with the unadulterated devotees of the Lord and gets a chance to hear the unadulterated glories of the Lord, certainly the flow of devotional service takes place like the flow of a river. As the river flows on till she reaches the sea, similarly pure devotional service flows by the association of pure devotees till it reaches the ultimate goal, namely, transcendental love of God. Such a flow of devotional service cannot stop. On the contrary, it increases more and more without limitation. The flow of devotional service is so potent that any onlooker also becomes liberated from the influence of the modes of passion and ignorance. These two qualities of nature are thus removed, and the living being is liberated, being situated in his original position.</div>

<div class="First">A pure Ved&#257;ntist, or a <span class="Italic">bhakti-ved&#257;nta,</span> instructs followers exactly according to the instructions of the Lord Himself. The Personality of Godhead, both in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and in all other scriptures, has definitely instructed men to follow the Lord only. The Lord is the creator, maintainer and annihilator of everything. The whole manifested creation is existing by His will, and by His will when the whole show is finished He will remain in His eternal abode with all His paraphernalia. Before the creation He was there in the eternal abode, and after the annihilation He will continue to remain. He is not, therefore, one of the created beings. He is transcendental. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the Lord says that long, long before the instruction was imparted to Arjuna, the same was instructed to the sun-god, and in course of time, the same instruction, being wrongly handled and being broken, was again instructed to Arjuna because he was His perfect devotee and friend. Therefore, the instruction of the Lord can be understood by the devotees only and no one else. The impersonalist, who has no idea of the transcendental form of the Lord, cannot understand this most confidential message of the Lord. The expression "most confidential" is significant here because knowledge of devotional service is far, far above knowledge of impersonal Brahman. <span class="Italic">J&ntilde;&#257;nam</span> means ordinary knowledge or any branch of knowledge. This knowledge develops up to the knowledge of impersonal Brahman. Above this, when it is partially mixed with devotion, such knowledge develops to knowledge of Param&#257;tm&#257;, or the all-pervading Godhead. This is more confidential. But when such knowledge is turned into pure devotional service and the confidential part of transcendental knowledge is attained, it is called the most confidential knowledge. This most confidential knowledge was imparted by the Lord to Brahm&#257;, Arjuna, Uddhava, etc.</div>

<div class="First">By devotional service or by the most confidential knowledge, one can understand very easily how the different energies of the Lord are working. One part of energy is manifesting the material world; the other (superior) part of His energy is manifesting the spiritual world. And the via medium energy is manifesting the living entities who are serving either of the above-mentioned energies. The living entities serving material energy are struggling hard for existence and happiness, which is presented to them as illusion. But those in the spiritual energy are placed under the direct service of the Lord in eternal life, complete knowledge and perpetual bliss. The Lord desires, as He has directly said in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> that all conditioned souls, rotting in the kingdom of material energy, come back to Him by giving up all engagements in the material world. This is the most confidential part of knowledge. But this can be understood only by the pure devotees, and only such devotees enter the kingdom of God to see Him personally and serve Him personally. The concrete example is N&#257;rada Himself, who attained this stage of eternal knowledge and eternal bliss. And the ways and means are open to all, provided one agrees to follow in the footsteps of &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada Muni. According to <span class="Italic">&#347;ruti,</span> the Supreme Lord has unlimited energies (without effort by Him), and these are described under three principal headings, as above mentioned.</div>

<div class="Translation">O Br&#257;hma&#7751;a Vy&#257;sadeva, it is decided by the learned that the best remedial measure for removing all troubles and miseries is to dedicate one's activities to the service of the Supreme Lord Personality of Godhead [&#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a].</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">&#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada Muni personally experienced that the most feasible and practical way to open the path of salvation or get relief from all miseries of life is to hear submissively the transcendental activities of the Lord from the right and bona fide sources. This is the only remedial process. The entire material existence is full of miseries. Foolish people have manufactured, out of their tiny brains, many remedial measures for removing the threefold miseries pertaining to the body and mind, pertaining to the natural disturbances and in relation with other living beings. The whole world is struggling very hard to exist out of these miseries, but men do not know that without the sanction of the Lord no plan or no remedial measure can actually bring about the desired peace and tranquillity. The remedial measure to cure a patient by medical treatment is useless if it is not sanctioned by the Lord. To cross the river or the ocean by a suitable boat is no remedial measure if it is not sanctioned by the Lord. We should know for certain that the Lord is the ultimate sanctioning officer, and we must therefore dedicate our attempts to the mercy of the Lord for ultimate success or to get rid of the obstacles on the path of success. The Lord is all-pervading, all-powerful, omniscient and omnipresent. He is the ultimate sanctioning agent of all good or bad effects. We should, therefore, learn to dedicate our activities unto the mercy of the Lord and accept Him either as impersonal Brahman, localized Param&#257;tm&#257; or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It does not matter what one is. One must dedicate everything in the service of the Lord. If one is a learned scholar, scientist, philosopher, poet, etc., then he should employ his learning to establish the supremacy of the Lord. Try to study the energy of the Lord in every sphere of life. Do not decry Him and try to become like Him or take His position simply by fragmental accumulation of knowledge. If one is an administrator, statesman, warrior, politician, etc., then one should try to establish the Lord's supremacy in statesmanship. Fight for the cause of the Lord as &#346;r&#299; Arjuna did. In the beginning, &#346;r&#299; Arjuna, the great fighter, declined to fight, but when he was convinced by the Lord that the fighting was necessary, &#346;r&#299; Arjuna changed his decision and fought for His cause. Similarly, if one is a businessman, an industrialist, an agriculturist, etc., then one should spend his hard-earned money for the cause of the Lord. Think always that the money which is accumulated is the wealth of the Lord. Wealth is considered to be the goddess of fortune (Lak&#7779;m&#299;), and the Lord is N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, or the husband of Lak&#7779;m&#299;. Try to engage Lak&#7779;m&#299; in the service of Lord N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a and be happy. That is the way to realize the Lord in every sphere of life. The best thing is, after all, to get relief from all material activities and engage oneself completely in hearing the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. But in case of the absence of such an opportunity, one should try to engage in the service of the Lord everything for which one has specific attraction, and that is the way of peace and prosperity. The word <span class="Italic">sa&#7745;s&#363;citam</span> in this stanza is also significant. One should not think for a moment that the realization of N&#257;rada was childish imagination only. It is not like that. It is so realized by the expert and erudite scholars, and that is the real import of the word <span class="Italic">sa&#7745;s&#363;citam.</span></div>

<div class="Translation">O good soul, does not a thing, applied therapeutically, cure a disease which was caused by that very same thing?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">An expert physician treats his patient with a therapeutic diet. For example, milk preparations sometimes cause disorder of the bowels, but the very same milk converted into curd and mixed with some other remedial ingredients cures such disorders. Similarly, the threefold miseries of material existence cannot be mitigated simply by material activities. Such activities have to be spiritualized, just as by fire iron is made red-hot, and thereby the action of fire begins. Similarly, the material conception of a thing is at once changed as soon as it is put into the service of the Lord. That is the secret of spiritual success. We should not try to lord it over the material nature, nor should we reject material things. The best way to make the best use of a bad bargain is to use everything in relation with the supreme spiritual being. Everything is an emanation from the supreme spirit, and by His inconceivable power He can convert spirit into matter and matter into spirit. Therefore a material thing (so-called) is at once turned into a spiritual force by the great will of the Lord. The necessary condition for such a change is to employ so-called matter in the service of the spirit. That is the way to treat our material diseases and elevate ourselves to the spiritual plane where there is no misery, no lamentation and no fear. When everything is thus employed in the service of the Lord, we can experience that there is nothing except the Supreme Brahman. The Vedic <span class="Italic">mantra</span> that "everything is Brahman" is thus realized by us.</div>

<div class="Translation">Thus when all a man's activities are dedicated to the service of the Lord, those very activities which caused his perpetual bondage become the destroyer of the tree of work.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Fruitive work which has perpetually engaged the living being is compared to the banyan tree in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> for it is certainly very deeply rooted. As long as the propensity for enjoying the fruit of work is there, one has to continue the transmigration of the soul from one body or place to another, according to one's nature of work. The propensity for enjoyment may be turned into the desire for serving the mission of the Lord, By doing so, one's activity is changed into <span class="Italic">karma-yoga,</span> or the way by which one can attain spiritual perfection while engaging in the work for which he has a natural tendency. Here the word <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;</span> indicates the categories of all fruitive work. The conclusion is that when the result of all fruitive and other work is dovetailed with the service of the Lord, it will cease to generate further <span class="Italic">karma</span> and will gradually develop into transcendental devotional service, which will not only cut off completely the root of the banyan tree of work but will also carry the performer to the lotus feet of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purport">The summary is that one has to, first of all, seek the association of pure devotees who not only are learned in the Ved&#257;nta but are self-realized souls and unalloyed devotees of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Personality of Godhead. In that association, the neophyte devotees must render loving service physically and mentally without reservation. This service attitude will induce the great souls to be more favorable in bestowing their mercy, which injects the neophyte with all the transcendental qualities of the pure devotees. Gradually this is developed into a strong attachment to hearing the transcendental pastimes of the Lord, which makes him able to catch up the constitutional position of the gross and subtle bodies and beyond them the knowledge of pure soul and his eternal relation with the Supreme Soul, the Personality of Godhead. After the relation is ascertained by establishment of the eternal relation, pure devotional service to the Lord begins gradually developing into perfect knowledge of the Personality of Godhead beyond the purview of impersonal Brahman and localized Param&#257;tm&#257;. By such <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;ottama-yoga,</span> as it is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> one is made perfect even during the present corporeal existence, and one exhibits all the good qualities of the Lord to the highest percentage. Such is the gradual development by association of pure devotees.</div>

<div class="Translation">Whatever work is done here in this life for the satisfaction of the mission of the Lord is called bhakti-yoga, or transcendental loving service to the Lord, and what is called knowledge becomes a concomitant factor.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The general and popular notion is that by discharging fruitive work in terms of the direction of the scriptures one becomes perfectly able to acquire transcendental knowledge for spiritual realization. <span class="Italic">Bhakti-yoga</span> is considered by some to be another form of <span class="Italic">karma.</span> But factually <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> is above both <span class="Italic">karma</span> and <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na.</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti-yoga</span> is independent of <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na</span> or <span class="Italic">karma;</span> on the other hand, <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na</span> and <span class="Italic">karma</span> are dependent on <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> This <span class="Italic">kriy&#257;-yoga</span> or <span class="Italic">karma-yoga,</span> as recommended by &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada to Vy&#257;sa, is specifically recommended because the principle is to satisfy the Lord. The Lord does not want His sons, the living beings, to suffer the threefold miseries of life. He desires that all of them come to Him and live with Him, but going back to Godhead means that one must purify himself from material infections. When work is performed, therefore, to satisfy the Lord, the performer becomes gradually purified from the material affection. This purification means attainment of spiritual knowledge. Therefore knowledge is dependent on <span class="Italic">karma,</span> or work, done on behalf of the Lord. Other knowledge, being devoid of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> or satisfaction of the Lord, cannot lead one back to the kingdom of God, which means that it cannot even offer salvation, as already explained in connection with the stanza <span class="Italic">nai&#7779;karmyam apy acyuta-bh&#257;va-varjitam</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic"></B>&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span></B> <a href="index3624.html?g=7431">1.5.12</a>).

<div class="Translation">While performing duties according to the order of &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one constantly remembers Him, His names and His qualities.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">An expert devotee of the Lord can mold his life in such a way that while performing all kinds of duties either for this or the next life, he can constantly remember the Lord's name, fame, qualities, etc. The order of the Lord is distinctly there in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;:</span> one should work only for the Lord in all spheres of life. In every sphere of life the Lord should be situated as the proprietor. According to the Vedic rites, even in the worship of some demigods like Indra, Brahm&#257;, Sarasvat&#299; and Ga&#7751;e&#347;a, the system is that in all circumstances the representation of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u must be there as <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;e&#347;vara,</span> or the controlling power of such sacrifices. It is recommended that a particular demigod be worshiped for a particular purpose, but still the presence of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is compulsory in order to make the function proper.</div>
<div class="Purport">Apart from such Vedic duties, even in our ordinary dealings (for example, in our household affairs or in our business or profession) we must consider that the result of all activities must be given over to the supreme enjoyer, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the Lord has declared Himself to be the supreme enjoyer of everything, the supreme proprietor of every planet and the supreme friend of all beings. No one else but Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a can claim to be the proprietor of everything within His creation. A pure devotee remembers this constantly, and in doing so he repeats the transcendental name, fame and qualities of the Lord, which means that he is constantly in touch with the Lord. The Lord is identical with His name, fame, etc., and therefore to be associated with His name, fame, etc., constantly, means actually to associate with the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purport">The major portion of our monetary income, not less than fifty percent, must be spent to carry out the order of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Not only should we give the profit of our earning to this cause, but we must also arrange to preach this cult of devotion to others because that is also one of the orders of the Lord. The Lord definitely says that no one is more dear to Him than one who is always engaged in the preaching work of the Lord's name and fame all over the world. The scientific discoveries of the material world can also be equally engaged in carrying out His order. He wants the message of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> to be preached amongst His devotees. It may not be so done amongst those who have no credit of austerities, charity, education, etc. Therefore, the attempt must go on to convert unwilling men to become His devotees. Lord Caitanya has taught a very simple method in this connection. He has taught the lesson for preaching the transcendental message through singing, dancing and refreshment. As such, fifty percent of our income may be spent for this purpose. In this fallen age of quarrel and dissension, if only the leading and wealthy persons of society agree to spend fifty percent of their income in the service of the Lord, as it is taught by Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, there is absolute certainty of converting this hell of pandemonium to the transcendental abode of the Lord. No one will disagree to partake in a function where good singing, dancing and refreshment are administered. Everyone will attend such a function, and everyone is sure to feel individually the transcendental presence of the Lord. This alone will help the attendant associate with the Lord and thereby purify himself in spiritual realization. The only condition for successfully executing such spiritual activities is that they must be conducted under the guidance of a pure devotee who is completely free from all mundane desires, fruitive activities and dry speculations about the nature of the Lord. No one has to discover the nature of the Lord. It is already spoken by the Lord Himself in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> especially and in all other Vedic literatures generally. We have simply to accept them <span class="Italic">in toto</span> and abide by the orders of the Lord. That will guide us to the path of perfection. One can remain in his own position. No one has to change his position, especially in this age of variegated difficulties. The only condition is that one must give up the habit of dry speculation aimed at becoming one with the Lord. And after giving up such lofty puffed-up vanities, one may very submissively receive the orders of the Lord in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> or <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> from the lips of a bona fide devotee whose qualification is mentioned above. That will make everything successful, without a doubt.</div>

N&#257;radaj&#299; has therefore explained the nature of unalloyed devotional service by his personal experience in the development of intimacy between the Lord and the living entity by a gradual process of progressive devotional activities. Such a progressive march of transcendental devotion for the Lord culminates in the attainment of loving service of the Lord, which is called <span class="Italic">prem&#257;</span> in different transcendental variegatedness called <span class="Italic">rasas</span> (tastes). Such devotional service is also executed in mixed forms, namely mixed with fruitive work or empiric philosophical speculations.</div>
<div class="Purport">Now the question which was raised by the great <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is</span> headed by &#346;aunaka regarding the confidential part of S&#363;ta's achievement through the spiritual master is explained herein by the chanting of this hymn consisting of thirty-three letters. And this <span class="Italic">mantra</span> is addressed to the four Deities, or the Lord with His plenary expansions. The central figure is Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a because the plenary portions are His aides-de-camp. The most confidential part of the instruction is that one should always chant and remember the glories of the Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, along with His different plenary portions expanded as V&#257;sudeva, Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. Those expansions are the original Deities for all other truths, namely either <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-tattva</span> or <span class="Italic">&#347;akti-tattvas.</span></div>

<div class="Translation">Thus he is the actual seer who worships, in the form of transcendental sound representation, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, who has no material form.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Our present senses are all made of material elements, and therefore they are imperfect in realizing the transcendental form of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. He is therefore worshiped by sound representation via the transcendental method of chanting. Anything which is beyond the scope of experience by our imperfect senses can be realized fully by the sound representation. A person transmitting sound from a far distant place can be factually experienced. If this is materially possible, why not spiritually? This experience is not a vague impersonal experience. It is actually an experience of the transcendental Personality of Godhead, who possesses the pure form of eternity, bliss and knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purport">In the <span class="Italic">Amarako&#347;a</span> Sanskrit dictionary the word <span class="Italic">m&#363;rti</span> carries import in twofold meanings, namely, form and difficulty. Therefore <span class="Italic">am&#363;rtikam</span> is explained by &#256;c&#257;rya &#346;r&#299; Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura as meaning "without difficulty." The transcendental form of eternal bliss and knowledge can be experienced by our original spiritual senses, which can be revived by chanting of the holy <span class="Italic">mantras,</span> or transcendental sound representations. Such sound should be received from the transparent agency of the bona fide spiritual master, and the chanting may be practiced by the direction of the spiritual master. That will gradually lead us nearer to the Lord. This method of worship is recommended in the <span class="Italic">p&#257;&ntilde;car&#257;trika</span> system, which is both recognized and authorized. The <span class="Italic">p&#257;&ntilde;car&#257;trika</span> system has the most authorized codes for transcendental devotional service. Without the help of such codes, one cannot approach the Lord, certainly not by dry philosophical speculation. The <span class="Italic">p&#257;&ntilde;car&#257;trika</span> system is both practical and suitable for this age of quarrel. The <span class="Italic">Pa&ntilde;car&#257;tra</span> is more important than the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta</span> for this modern age.</div>

<div class="First">Communion with the Lord by transmission of the transcendental sound is nondifferent from the whole spirit Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. It is a completely perfect method for approaching the Lord. By such pure contact with the Lord, without offense of material conceptions (numbering ten), the devotee can rise above the material plane to understand the inner meaning of the Vedic literatures, including the Lord's existence in the transcendental realm. The Lord reveals His identity gradually to one who has unflinching faith, both in the spiritual master and in the Lord. After this, the devotee is endowed with mystic opulences, which are eight in number. And above all, the devotee is accepted in the confidential entourage of the Lord and is entrusted with specific service of the Lord through the agency of the spiritual master. A pure devotee is more interested in serving the Lord than in showing an exhibition of the mystic powers dormant in him. &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada has explained all these from his personal experience, and one can obtain all the facilities which &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada obtained by perfecting the chanting process of the sound representation of the Lord.

<div class="Translation">Please, therefore, describe the Almighty Lord's activities which you have learned by your vast knowledge of the Vedas, for that will satisfy the hankerings of great learned men and at the same time mitigate the miseries of the masses of common people who are always suffering from material pangs. Indeed, there is no other way to get out of such miseries.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">&#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada Muni from practical experience definitely asserts that the prime solution of all problems of material work is to broadcast very widely the transcendental glories of the Supreme Lord. There are four classes of good men, and there are four classes of bad men also. The four classes of good men acknowledge the authority of the Almighty God, and therefore such good men (<B>1</B>) when they are in difficulty, (<B>2</B>) when they are in need of money, (<B>3</B>) when they are advanced in knowledge and (<B>4</B>) when they are inquisitive to know more and more about God, intuitively take shelter of the Lord. As such, N&#257;radaj&#299; advises Vy&#257;sadeva to broadcast the transcendental knowledge of God in terms of the vast Vedic knowledge which he had already attained.</div>
<div class="Purport">As far as the bad men are concerned, they are also four in number: (<B>1</B>) those who are simply addicted to the mode of progressive fruitive work and thus are subjected to the accompanying miseries, (<B>2</B>) those who are simply addicted to vicious work for sense satisfaction and so suffer the consequence, (<B>3</B>) those who are materially very much advanced in knowledge, but who suffer because they do not have the sense to acknowledge the authority of the Almighty Lord, and (<B>4</B>) the class of men who are known as atheists and who therefore purposely hate the very name of God, although they are always in difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299; N&#257;radaj&#299; advised Vy&#257;sadeva to describe the glories of the Lord just to do good to all eight classes of men, both good and bad. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is therefore not meant for any particular class of men or sect.

<div class="First">The word <span class="Italic">bh&#257;va</span> is significant here. This <span class="Italic">bh&#257;va</span> stage is attained after one has transcendental affection for the Lord. The first initial stage is called <span class="Italic">&#347;raddh&#257;,</span> or a liking for the Supreme Lord, and in order to increase that liking one has to associate with pure devotees of the Lord. The third stage is to practice the prescribed rules and regulations of devotional service. This will dissipate all sorts of misgivings and remove all personal deficiencies that hamper progress in devotional service.</div>
<div class="Purport">When all misgivings and personal deficiencies are removed, there is a standard faith in transcendental matter, and the taste for it increases in greater proportion. This stage leads to attraction, and after this there is <span class="Italic">bh&#257;va,</span> or the prior stage of unalloyed love for God. All the above different stages are but different stages of development of transcendental love. Being so surcharged with transcendental love, there comes a strong feeling of separation which leads to eight different kinds of ecstasies. Tears from the eyes of a devotee is an automatic reaction, and because &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada Muni in his previous birth attained that stage very quickly after his departure from home, it was quite possible for him to perceive the actual presence of the Lord, which he tangibly experienced by his developed spiritual senses without material tinge.</div>

<div class="First">Spiritual feelings of happiness and intense ecstasies have no mundane comparison. Therefore it is very difficult to give expression to such feelings. We can just have a glimpse of such ecstasy in the words of &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada Muni. Each and every part of the body or senses has its particular function. After seeing the Lord, all the senses become fully awakened to render service unto the Lord because in the liberated state the senses are fully efficient in serving the Lord. As such, in that transcendental ecstasy it so happened that the senses became separately enlivened to serve the Lord. This being so, N&#257;rada Muni lost himself in seeing both himself and the Lord simultaneously.</div>

<div class="Translation">The transcendental form of the Lord, as it is, satisfies the mind's desire and at once erases all mental incongruities. Upon losing that form, I suddenly got up, being perturbed, as is usual when one loses that which is desirable.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">That the Lord is not formless is experienced by N&#257;rada Muni. But His form is completely different from all forms of our material experience. For the whole duration of our life we go see different forms in the material world, but none of them is just apt to satisfy the mind, nor can any one of them vanish all perturbance of the mind. These are the special features of the transcendental form of the Lord, and one who has once seen that form is not satisfied with anything else; no form in the material world can any longer satisfy the seer. That the Lord is formless or impersonal means that He has nothing like a material form and is not like any material personality.</div>
<div class="Purport">As spiritual beings, having eternal relations with that transcendental form of the Lord, we are, life after life, searching after that form of the Lord, and we are not satisfied by any other form of material appeasement. N&#257;rada Muni got a glimpse of this, but having not seen it again he became perturbed and stood up all of a sudden to search it out. What we desire life after life was obtained by N&#257;rada Muni, and losing sight of Him again was certainly a great shock for him.</div>

<div class="Translation">I desired to see again that transcendental form of the Lord, but despite my attempts to concentrate upon the heart with eagerness to view the form again, I could not see Him any more, and thus dissatisfied, I was very much aggrieved.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">There is no mechanical process to see the form of the Lord. It completely depends on the causeless mercy of the Lord. We cannot demand the Lord to be present before our vision, just as we cannot demand the sun to rise whenever we like. The sun rises out of his own accord; so also the Lord is pleased to be present out of His causeless mercy. One should simply await the opportune moment and go on discharging his prescribed duty in devotional service of the Lord. N&#257;rada Muni thought that the Lord could be seen again by the same mechanical process which was successful in the first attempt, but in spite of his utmost endeavor he could not make the second attempt successful. The Lord is completely independent of all obligations. He can simply be bound up by the tie of unalloyed devotion. Nor is He visible or perceivable by our material senses. When He pleases, being satisfied with the sincere attempt of devotional service depending completely on the mercy of the Lord, then He may be seen out of His own accord.</div>

<div class="First">In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> it is said that God is beyond the approach of mundane words and intelligence. And yet by His causeless mercy one can have suitable senses to hear Him or to speak to Him. This is the Lord's inconceivable energy. One upon whom His mercy is bestowed can hear Him. The Lord was much pleased with N&#257;rada Muni, and therefore the necessary strength was invested in him so that he could hear the Lord. It is not, however, possible for others to perceive directly the touch of the Lord during the probationary stage of regulative devotional service. It was a special gift for N&#257;rada. When he heard the pleasing words of the Lord, the feelings of separation were to some extent mitigated. A devotee in love with God feels always the pangs of separation and is therefore always enwrapped in transcendental ecstasy.</div>

<div class="Translation">O N&#257;rada [the Lord spoke], I regret that during this lifetime you will not be able to see Me anymore. Those who are incomplete in service and who are not completely free from all material taints can hardly see Me.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Personality of Godhead is described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as the most pure, the Supreme and the Absolute Truth. There is no trace of a tinge of materiality in His person, and thus one who has the slightest tinge of material affection cannot approach Him. The beginning of devotional service starts from the point when one is freed from at least two forms of material modes, namely the mode of passion and the mode of ignorance. The result is exhibited by the signs of being freed from <span class="Italic">k&#257;ma</span> (lust) and <span class="Italic">lobha</span> (covetousness). That is to say, one must be freed from the desires for sense satisfaction and avarice for sense gratification. The balanced mode of nature is goodness. And to be completely freed from all material tinges is to become free from the mode of goodness also. To search the audience of God in a lonely forest is considered to be in the mode of goodness. One can go out into the forest to attain spiritual perfection, but that does not mean that one can see the Lord personally there. One must be completely freed from all material attachment and be situated on the plane of transcendence, which alone will help the devotee get in personal touch with the Personality of Godhead. The best method is that one should live at a place where the transcendental form of the Lord is worshiped. The temple of the Lord is a transcendental place, whereas the forest is a materially good habitation. A neophyte devotee is always recommended to worship the Deity of the Lord (<span class="Italic">arcan&#257;</span>) rather than go into the forest to search out the Lord. Devotional service begins from the process of <span class="Italic">arcan&#257;,</span> which is better than going out in the forest. In his present life, which is completely freed from all material hankerings, &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada Muni does not go into the forest, although he can turn every place into Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha by his presence only. He travels from one planet to another to convert men, gods, Kinnaras, Gandharvas, <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is, munis</span> and all others to become devotees of the Lord. By his activities he has engaged many devotees like Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and many others in the transcendental service of the Lord. A pure devotee of the Lord, therefore, follows in the footsteps of the great devotees like N&#257;rada and Prahl&#257;da and engages his whole time in glorifying the Lord by the process of <span class="Italic">k&#299;rtana.</span> Such a preaching process is transcendental to all material qualities.</div>

<div class="Translation">O virtuous one, you have only once seen My person, and this is just to increase your desire for Me, because the more you hanker for Me, the more you will be freed from all material desires.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">A living being cannot be vacant of desires. He is not a dead stone. He must be working, thinking, feeling and willing. But when he thinks, feels and wills materially, he becomes entangled, and conversely when he thinks, feels and wills for the service of the Lord, he becomes gradually freed from all entanglement. The more a person is engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, the more he acquires a hankering for it. That is the transcendental nature of godly service. Material service has satiation, whereas spiritual service of the Lord has neither satiation nor end. One can go on increasing his hankerings for the loving transcendental service of the Lord, and yet he will not find satiation or end. By intense service of the Lord, one can experience the presence of the Lord transcendentally. Therefore seeing the Lord means being engaged in His service because His service and His person are identical. The sincere devotee should go on with sincere service of the Lord. The Lord will give proper direction as to how and where it has to be done. There was no material desire in N&#257;rada, and yet just to increase his intense desire for the Lord, he was so advised.</div>

As a very rich man has no hankerings for small petty things, so also a devotee of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who is guaranteed to pass on to the kingdom of God, where life is eternal, fully cognizant and blissful, naturally has no hankerings for petty material things, which are like dolls or shadows of the reality and are without permanent value. That is the sign of spiritually enriched persons. And in due course of time, when a pure devotee is completely prepared, all of a sudden the change of body occurs which is commonly called death. And for the pure devotee such a change takes place exactly like lightning, and illumination follows simultaneously. That is to say a devotee simultaneously changes his material body and develops a spiritual body by the will of the Supreme. Even before death, a pure devotee has no material affection, due to his body's being spiritualized like a red-hot iron in contact with fire.</div>

<div class="Translation">Having been awarded a transcendental body befitting an associate of the Personality of Godhead, I quit the body made of five material elements, and thus all acquired fruitive results of work [karma] stopped.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Informed by the Personality of Godhead that he would be awarded a transcendental body befitting the Lord's association, N&#257;rada got his spiritual body as soon as he quitted his material body. This transcendental body is free from material affinity and invested with three primary transcendental qualities, namely eternity, freedom from material modes, and freedom from reactions of fruitive activities. The material body is always afflicted with the lack of these three qualities. A devotee's body becomes at once surcharged with the transcendental qualities as soon as he is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. It acts like the magnetic influence of a touchstone upon iron. The influence of transcendental devotional service is like that. Therefore change of the body means stoppage of the reaction of three qualitative modes of material nature upon the pure devotee. There are many instances of this in the revealed scriptures. Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and many other devotees were able to see the Personality of Godhead face to face apparently in the same body. This means that the quality of a devotee's body changes from material to transcendence. That is the opinion of the authorized Gosv&#257;m&#299;s via the authentic scriptures. In the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> it is said that beginning from the <span class="Italic">indra-gopa</span> germ up to the great Indra, King of heaven, all living beings are subjected to the law of <span class="Italic">karma</span> and are bound to suffer and enjoy the fruitive results of their own work. Only the devotee is exempt from such reactions, by the causeless mercy of the supreme authority, the Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="First">As stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> there are three divisions of the material spheres, namely the <span class="Italic">&#363;rdhva-loka</span> (topmost planets), <span class="Italic">madhya-loka</span> (midway planets) and <span class="Italic">adho-loka</span> (downward planets). Beyond the <span class="Italic">&#363;rdhva-loka</span> planets, that is to say above the Brahmaloka, are the material coverings of the universes, and above that is the spiritual sky, which is unlimited in expansion, containing unlimited self-illuminated Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets inhabited by God Himself along with His associates, who are all eternally liberated living entities. &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada Muni could enter all these planets in both the material and spiritual spheres without restriction, as much as the almighty Lord is free to move personally in any part of His creation. In the material world the living beings are influenced by the three material modes of nature, namely goodness, passion and ignorance. But &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada Muni is transcendental to all these material modes, and thus he can travel everywhere unrestricted. He is a liberated spaceman. The causeless mercy of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is unparalleled, and such mercy is perceived by the devotees only by the grace of the Lord. Therefore, the devotees never fall down, but the materialists, i.e., the fruitive workers and the speculative philosophers, do fall down, being forced by their respective modes of nature. The <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is,</span> as above mentioned, cannot enter into the transcendental world like N&#257;rada.

All the great authorities in the devotional service of the Lord follow in the footsteps of N&#257;rada Muni in the order of the <span class="Italic">N&#257;rada-bhakti-s&#363;tra,</span> and therefore all the devotees of the Lord are unhesitatingly qualified to enter into the kingdom of God, Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha.</div>

<div class="First">The Absolute Personality of Godhead is not different from His transcendental name, form, pastimes and the sound vibrations thereof. As soon as a pure devotee engages himself in the pure devotional service of hearing, chanting and remembering the name, fame and activities of the Lord, at once He becomes visible to the transcendental eyes of the pure devotee by reflecting Himself on the mirror of the heart by spiritual television. Therefore a pure devotee who is related with the Lord in loving transcendental service can experience the presence of the Lord at every moment. It is a natural psychology in every individual case that a person likes to hear and enjoy his personal glories enumerated by others. That is a natural instinct, and the Lord, being also an individual personality like others, is not an exception to this psychology because psychological characteristics visible in the individual souls are but reflections of the same psychology in the Absolute Lord. The only difference is that the Lord is the greatest personality of all and absolute in all His affairs. If, therefore, the Lord is attracted by the pure devotee's chanting of His glories, there is nothing astonishing. Since He is absolute, He can appear Himself in the picture of His glorification, the two things being identical. &#346;r&#299;la N&#257;rada chants the glorification of the Lord not for his personal benefit but because the glorifications are identical with the Lord. N&#257;rada Muni penetrates into the presence of the Lord by the transcendental chanting.</div>

<div class="Translation">It is personally experienced by me that those who are always full of cares and anxieties due to desiring contact of the senses with their objects can cross the ocean of nescience on a most suitable boat-the constant chanting of the transcendental activities of the Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The symptom of a living being is that he cannot remain silent even for some time. He must be doing something, thinking of something or talking about something. Generally the materialistic men think and discuss about subjects which satisfy their senses. But as these things are exercised under the influence of the external, illusory energy, such sensual activities do not actually give them any satisfaction. On the contrary, they become full with cares and anxieties. This is called <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> or what is not. That which cannot give them satisfaction is accepted as an object for satisfaction. So N&#257;rada Muni, by his personal experience, says that satisfaction for such frustrated beings engaged in sense gratification is to chant always the activities of the Lord. The point is that the subject matter only should be changed. No one can check the thinking activities of a living being, nor the feeling, willing or working processes. But if one wants actual happiness, one must change the subject matter only. Instead of talking of the politics of a dying man, one might discuss the politics administered by the Lord Himself. Instead of relishing activities of the cinema artists, one can turn his attention to the activities of the Lord with His eternal associates like the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> and Lak&#7779;m&#299;s. The almighty Personality of Godhead, by His causeless mercy, descends on the earth and manifests activities almost on the line of the worldly men, but at the same time extraordinarily, because He is almighty. He does so for the benefit of all conditioned souls so that they can turn their attention to transcendence. By doing so, the conditioned soul will gradually be promoted to the transcendental position and easily cross the ocean of nescience, the source of all miseries. This is stated from personal experience by such an authority as &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada Muni. And we can have the same experience also if we begin to follow in the footsteps of the great sage, the dearmost devotee of the Lord.</div>

The senses are considered like venomous serpents, and the <span class="Italic">yoga</span> system is just to control them. On the other hand, N&#257;rada Muni recommends another method for controlling the senses in the transcendental loving service of Mukunda, the Personality of Godhead. By his experience he says that devotional service to the Lord is more effective and practical than the system of artificially controlling the senses. In the service of the Lord Mukunda, the senses are transcendentally engaged. Thus there is no chance of their being engaged in sense satisfaction. The senses want some engagement. To check them artificially is no check at all because as soon as there is some opportunity for enjoyment, the serpentlike senses will certainly take advantage of it. There are many such instances in history, just like Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra Muni's falling a victim to the beauty of Menak&#257;. But &#7788;h&#257;kura Harid&#257;sa was allured at midnight by the well-dressed M&#257;y&#257;, and still she could not induce that great devotee into her trap.</div>
<div class="Purport">The whole idea is that without devotional service of the Lord, neither the <span class="Italic">yoga</span> system nor dry philosophical speculation can ever become successful. Pure devotional service of the Lord, without being tinged with fruitive work, mystic <span class="Italic">yoga</span> or speculative philosophy, is the foremost procedure to attain self-realization. Such pure devotional service is transcendental in nature, and the systems of <span class="Italic">yoga</span> and <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na</span> are subordinate to such a process. When the transcendental devotional service is mixed with a subordinate process, it is no longer transcendental but is called mixed devotional service. &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva, the author of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> will gradually develop all these different systems of transcendental realization in the text.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The process of devotional activities from the beginning to the stage of transcendence is all duly explained to satisfy the inquiries of Vy&#257;sadeva. He has explained how the seeds of devotional service were sown by transcendental association and how they gradually developed by hearing the sages. The result of such hearing is detachment from worldliness, so much so that even a small boy could receive the death news of his mother, who was his only caretaker, as the blessing of God. And at once he took the opportunity to search out the Lord. A sincere urge for having an interview with the Lord was also granted to him, although it is not possible for anyone to see the Lord with mundane eyes. He also explained how by execution of pure transcendental service one can get rid of the fruitive action of accumulated work and how he transformed his material body into a spiritual one. The spiritual body is alone able to enter into the spiritual realm of the Lord, and no one but a pure devotee is eligible to enter into the kingdom of God. All the mysteries of transcendental realization are duly experienced by N&#257;rada Muni himself, and therefore by hearing such an authority one can have some idea of the results of devotional life, which are hardly delineated even in the original texts of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads</span> there are only indirect hints to all this. Nothing is directly explained there, and therefore <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the mature fruit of all the Vedic trees of literatures.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Every living being is anxious for full freedom because that is his transcendental nature. And this freedom is obtained only through the transcendental service of the Lord. Illusioned by the external energy, everyone thinks that he is free, but actually he is bound up by the laws of nature. A conditioned soul cannot freely move from one place to another even on this earth, and what to speak of one planet to another. But a full-fledged free soul like N&#257;rada, always engaged in chanting the Lord's glory, is free to move not only on earth but also in any part of the universe, as well as in any part of the spiritual sky. We can just imagine the extent and unlimitedness of his freedom, which is as good as that of the Supreme Lord. There is no reason or obligation for his traveling, and no one can stop him from his free movement. Similarly, the transcendental system of devotional service is also free. It may or may not develop in a particular person even after he undergoes all the detailed formulas. Similarly, the association of the devotee is also free. One may be fortunate to have it, or one may not have it even after thousands of endeavors. Therefore, in all spheres of devotional service, freedom is the main pivot. Without freedom there is no execution of devotional service. The freedom surrendered to the Lord does not mean that the devotee becomes dependent in every respect. To surrender unto the Lord through the transparent medium of the spiritual master is to attain complete freedom of life.</div>

<div class="First">Perfect vision of the Absolute Truth is possible only by the linking process of devotional service. This is also confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> One can perfectly realize the Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead only by the process of devotional service, and one can enter into the kingdom of God by such perfect knowledge. Imperfect realization of the Absolute by the partial approach of the impersonal Brahman or localized Param&#257;tm&#257; does not permit anyone to enter into the kingdom of God. &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada advised &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva to become absorbed in transcendental meditation on the Personality of Godhead and His activities. &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva did not take notice of the effulgence of Brahman because that is not absolute vision. The absolute vision is the Personality of Godhead, as it is confirmed in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index4112.html?g=2631">7.19</a>): <span class="Italic">v&#257;sudeva&#7717; sarvam iti.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads</span> also it is confirmed that V&#257;sudeva, the Personality of Godhead, is covered by the golden glowing <span class="Italic">hira&#7751;mayena p&#257;tre&#7751;a</span> veil of impersonal Brahman, and when that curtain is removed by the mercy of the Lord the real face of the Absolute is seen. The Absolute is mentioned here as the <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a,</span> or person. The Absolute Personality of Godhead is mentioned in so many Vedic literatures, and in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> the <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a</span> is confirmed as the eternal and original person. The Absolute Personality of Godhead is the perfect person. The Supreme Person has manifold energies, out of which the internal, external and marginal energies are specifically important. The energy mentioned here is the external energy, as will be clear from the statements of her activities. The internal energy is there along with the Absolute Person as the moonlight is there with the moon. The external energy is compared to darkness because it keeps the living entities in the darkness of ignorance. The word <span class="Italic">ap&#257;&#347;rayam</span> suggests that this energy of the Lord is under full control. The internal potency or superior energy is also called <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> but it is spiritual <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> or energy exhibited in the absolute realm. When one is under the shelter of this internal potency, the darkness of material ignorance is at once dissipated. And even those who are <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;r&#257;ma,</span> or fixed in trance, take shelter of this <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> or internal energy. Devotional service, or <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> is the function of the internal energy; thus there is no place for the inferior energy, or material energy, just as there is no place for darkness in the effulgence of spiritual light. Such internal energy is even superior to the spiritual bliss attainable in the conception of impersonal Brahman. It is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> that the impersonal Brahman effulgence is also an emanation from the Absolute Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The <span class="Italic">parama-puru&#7779;a</span> cannot be anyone except &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself, as will be explained in the later <span class="Italic">&#347;lokas.</span></div>

<div class="First">The root cause of suffering by the materialistic living beings is pointed out with remedial measures which are to be undertaken and also the ultimate perfection to be gained. All this is mentioned in this particular verse. The living being is by constitution transcendental to material encagement, but he is now imprisoned by the external energy, and therefore he thinks himself one of the material products. And due to this unholy contact, the pure spiritual entity suffers material miseries under the modes of material nature. The living entity misunderstands himself to be a material product. This means that the present perverted way of thinking, feeling and willing, under material conditions, is not natural for him. But he has his normal way of thinking, feeling and willing. The living being in his original state is not without thinking, willing and feeling power. It is also confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> that the actual knowledge of the conditioned soul is now covered by nescience. Thus the theory that a living being is absolute impersonal Brahman is refuted herein. This cannot be, because the living entity has his own way of thinking in his original unconditional state also. The present conditional state is due to the influence of the external energy, which means that the illusory energy takes the initiative while the Supreme Lord is aloof. The Lord does not desire that a living being be illusioned by external energy. The external energy is aware of this fact, but still she accepts a thankless task of keeping the forgotten soul under illusion by her bewildering influence. The Lord does not interfere with the task of the illusory energy because such performances of the illusory energy are also necessary for reformation of the conditioned soul. An affectionate father does not like his children to be chastised by another agent, yet he puts his disobedient children under the custody of a severe man just to bring them to order. But the all-affectionate Almighty Father at the same time desires relief for the conditioned soul, relief from the clutches of the illusory energy. The king puts the disobedient citizens within the walls of the jail, but sometimes the king, desiring the prisoners' relief, personally goes there and pleads for reformation, and on his doing so the prisoners are set free. Similarly, the Supreme Lord descends from His kingdom upon the kingdom of illusory energy and personally gives relief in the form of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> wherein He personally suggests that although the ways of illusory energy are very stiff to overcome, one who surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Lord is set free by the order of the Supreme. This surrendering process is the remedial measure for getting relief from the bewildering ways of the illusory energy. The surrendering process is completed by the influence of association. The Lord has suggested, therefore, that by the influence of the speeches of saintly persons who have actually realized the Supreme, men are engaged in His transcendental loving service. The conditioned soul gets a taste for hearing about the Lord, and by such hearing only he is gradually elevated to the platform of respect, devotion and attachment for the Lord. The whole thing is completed by the surrendering process. Herein also the same suggestion is made by the Lord in His incarnation of Vy&#257;sadeva. This means that the conditioned souls are being reclaimed by the Lord both ways, namely by the process of punishment by the external energy of the Lord, and by Himself as the spiritual master within and without. Within the heart of every living being the Lord Himself as the Supersoul (Param&#257;tm&#257;) becomes the spiritual master, and from without He becomes the spiritual master in the shape of scriptures, saints and the initiator spiritual master. This is still more explicitly explained in the next <span class="Italic">&#347;loka.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">Personal superintendence of the illusory energy is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> (the <span class="Italic">Kena Upani&#7779;ad</span>) in relation to the demigods' controlling power. Herein also it is clearly stated that the living entity is controlled by the external energy in a personal capacity. The living being thus subject to the control of external energy is differently situated. It is clear, however, from the present statement of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> that the same external energy is situated in the inferior position before the Personality of Godhead, or the perfect being. The perfect being, or the Lord, cannot be approached even by the illusory energy, who can only work on the living entities. Therefore it is sheer imagination that the Supreme Lord is illusioned by the illusory energy and thus becomes a living being. If the living being and the Lord were in the same category, then it would have been quite possible for Vy&#257;sadeva to see it, and there would have been no question of material distress on the part of the illusioned being, for the Supreme Being is fully cognizant. So there are so many unscrupulous imaginations on the part of the monists to endeavor to put both the Lord and the living being in the same category. Had the Lord and the living beings been the same, then &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; would not have taken the trouble to describe the transcendental pastimes of the Lord, for they would all be manifestations of illusory energy.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the <span class="Italic">summum bonum</span> remedy for suffering humanity in the clutches of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva therefore first of all diagnosed the actual disease of the conditioned souls, i.e., their being illusioned by the external energy. He also saw the perfect Supreme Being, from whom illusory energy is far removed, though He saw both the diseased conditioned souls and also the cause of the disease. And the remedial measures are suggested in the next verse. Both the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living beings are undoubtedly qualitatively one, but the Lord is the controller of the illusory energy, whereas the living entity is controlled by the illusory energy. Thus the Lord and the living beings are simultaneously one and different. Another point is distinct herein: that eternal relation between the Lord and the living being is transcendental, otherwise the Lord would not have taken the trouble to reclaim the conditioned souls from the clutches of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> In the same way, the living entity is also required to revive his natural love and affection for the Lord, and that is the highest perfection of the living entity. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> treats the conditioned soul with an aim to that goal of life.</div>

<div class="Translation">The material miseries of the living entity, which are superfluous to him, can be directly mitigated by the linking process of devotional service. But the mass of people do not know this, and therefore the learned Vy&#257;sadeva compiled this Vedic literature, which is in relation to the Supreme Truth.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">&#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva saw the all-perfect Personality of Godhead. This statement suggests that the complete unit of the Personality of Godhead includes His parts and parcels also. He saw, therefore, His different energies, namely the internal energy, the marginal energy and the external energy. He also saw His different plenary portions and parts of the plenary portions, namely His different incarnations also, and he specifically observed the unwanted miseries of the conditioned souls, who are bewildered by the external energy. And at last he saw the remedial measure for the conditioned souls, namely, the process of devotional service. It is a great transcendental science and begins with the process of hearing and chanting the name, fame, glory, etc., of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Revival of the dormant affection or love of Godhead does not depend on the mechanical system of hearing and chanting, but it solely and wholly depends on the causeless mercy of the Lord. When the Lord is fully satisfied with the sincere efforts of the devotee, He may endow him with His loving transcendental service. But even with the prescribed forms of hearing and chanting, there is at once mitigation of the superfluous and unwanted miseries of material existence. Such mitigation of material affection does not wait for development of transcendental knowledge. Rather, knowledge is dependent on devotional service for the ultimate realization of the Supreme Truth.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Simply by giving aural reception to this Vedic literature, the feeling for loving devotional service to Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, sprouts up at once to extinguish the fire of lamentation, illusion and fearfulness.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">There are various senses, of which the ear is the most effective. This sense works even when a man is deep asleep. One can protect himself from the hands of an enemy while awake, but while asleep one is protected by the ear only. The importance of hearing is mentioned here in connection with attaining the highest perfection of life, namely, getting free from three material pangs. Everyone is full of lamentation at every moment, he is after the mirage of illusory things, and he is always afraid of his supposed enemy. These are the primary symptoms of material disease. And it is definitely suggested herein that simply by hearing the message of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> one gets attachment for the Supreme Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and as soon as this is effected the symptoms of the material diseases disappear. &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva saw the all-perfect Personality of Godhead, and in this statement the all-perfect Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is clearly confirmed.</div>
<div class="Purport">The ultimate result of devotional service is to develop genuine love for the Supreme Personality. Love is a word which is often used in relation with man and woman. And love is the only word that can be properly used to indicate the relation between Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and the living entities. The living entities are mentioned as <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti</span> in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> and in Sanskrit <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti</span> is a feminine object. The Lord is always described as the <span class="Italic">parama-puru&#7779;a,</span> or the supreme male personality. Thus the affection between the Lord and the living entities is something like that between the male and the female. Therefore the term love of Godhead is quite appropriate.</div>
<div class="Purport">Loving devotional service to the Lord begins with hearing about the Lord. There is no difference between the Lord and the subject matter heard about Him. The Lord is absolute in all respects, and thus there is no difference between Him and the subject matter heard about Him. Therefore, hearing about Him means immediate contact with Him by the process of vibration of the transcendental sound. And the transcendental sound is so effective that it acts at once by removing all material affections mentioned above. As mentioned before, a living entity develops a sort of complexity by material association, and the illusory encagement of the material body is accepted as an actual fact. Under such false complexity, the living beings under different categories of life become illusioned in different ways. Even in the most developed stage of human life, the same illusion prevails in the form of many isms and divides the loving relation with the Lord and thereby divides the loving relation between man and man. By hearing the subject matter of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> this false complexity of materialism is removed, and real peace in society begins, which politicians aspire for so eagerly in so many political situations. The politicians want a peaceful situation between man and man, and nation and nation, but at the same time, because of too much attachment for material domination, there is illusion and fearfulness. Therefore the politicians' peace conferences cannot bring about peace in society. It can only be done by hearing the subject matter described in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> about the Supreme Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The foolish politicians may go on holding peace and summit conferences for hundreds of years, but they will fail to achieve success. Until we reach the stage of reestablishing our lost relation with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the illusion of accepting the body as the self will prevail, and thus fearfulness will also prevail. As for the validity of &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there are hundreds and thousands of evidences from revealed scriptures, and there are hundreds and thousands of evidences from personal experiences of devotees in various places like V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, Navadv&#299;pa and Pur&#299;. Even in the <span class="Italic">Kaumud&#299;</span> dictionary the synonyms of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a are given as the son of Ya&#347;od&#257; and the Supreme Personality of Godhead Parabrahman. The conclusion is that simply by hearing the Vedic literature <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> one can have direct connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and thereby one can attain the highest perfection of life by transcending worldly miseries, illusion and fearfulness. These are practical tests for one who has actually given a submissive hearing to the readings of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span></div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"><span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the natural commentation on the <span class="Italic">Brahma-s&#363;tras</span> compiled by the same author. This <span class="Italic">Brahma-s&#363;tra,</span> or <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra,</span> is meant for those who are already engaged in self-realization. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is so made that one becomes at once engaged in the path of self-realization simply by hearing the topics.

Worldly men are all engaged in sense gratification. But even such men will find in this Vedic literature a remedial measure for their material diseases. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was a liberated soul from the very beginning of his birth, and his father taught him <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> Amongst mundane scholars, there is some diversity of opinion as to the date of compilation of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> It is, however, certain from the text of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> that it was compiled before the disappearance of King Par&#299;k&#7779;it and after the departure of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. When Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was ruling the world as the King of Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a, he chastised the personality of Kali. According to revealed scriptures and astrological calculation, the age of Kali is in its five thousandth year. Therefore, <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> was compiled not less than five thousand years ago. <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> was compiled before <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> and the <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> were compiled before <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata.</span> That is an estimation of the date of compilation of the different Vedic literatures.

He points out eleven factors in the <span class="Italic">&#347;loka,</span> namely (<B>1</B>) <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>&#257;tm&#257;r&#257;ma,</span></B> (<B>2</B>) <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>munaya&#7717;,</span></B> (<B>3</B>) <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>nirgrantha,</span></B> (<B>4</B>) <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>api,</span></B> (<B>5</B>) <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>ca,</span></B> (<B>6</B>) <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>urukrama,</span></B> (<B>7</B>) <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>kurvanti,</span></B> (<B>8</B>) <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>ahaituk&#299;m,</span></B> (<B>9</B>) <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>bhaktim,</span></B> (<B>10</B>) <span class="Italic">ittham-bh&#363;ta-gu&#7751;a&#7717;,</span> and (<B>11</B>) <span class="Italic">hari&#7717;.</span> According to the <span class="Italic">Vi&#347;va-prak&#257;&#347;a</span> Sanskrit dictionary, there are seven synonyms for the word <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;r&#257;ma,</span> which are as follows: (<B>1</B>) Brahman (the Absolute Truth), (<B>2</B>) body, (<B>3</B>) mind, (<B>4</B>) endeavor, (<B>5</B>) endurance, (<B>6</B>) intelligence, and (<B>7</B>) personal habits.</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">munaya&#7717;</span> refers to (<B>1</B>) those who are thoughtful, (<B>2</B>) those who are grave and silent, (<B>3</B>) ascetics, (<B>4</B>) the persistent, (<B>5</B>) mendicants, (<B>6</B>) sages, and (<B>7</B>) saints.</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">nirgrantha</span> conveys these ideas: (<B>1</B>) one who is liberated from nescience, (<B>2</B>) one who has no connection with scriptural injunction, i.e., who is freed from the obligation of the rules and regulations mentioned in the revealed scriptures like ethics, <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> philosophy, psychology and metaphysics (in other words the fools, illiterate, urchins, etc., who have no connection with regulative principles), (<B>3</B>) a capitalist, and also (<B>4</B>) one who is penniless.</div>
<div class="Purport">According to the <span class="Italic">&#346;abda-ko&#347;a</span> dictionary, the affix <span class="Italic">ni</span> is used in the sense of (<B>1</B>) certainty, (<B>2</B>) counting, (<B>3</B>) building, and (<B>4</B>) forbiddance, and the word <span class="Italic">grantha</span> is used in the sense of wealth, thesis, vocabulary, etc.</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">urukrama</span> means "the one whose activities are glorious." <span class="Italic">Krama</span> means "step." This word <span class="Italic">urukrama</span> specifically indicates the Lord's incarnation as V&#257;mana, who covered the whole universe by immeasurable steps. Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is powerful, and His activities are so glorious that He has created the spiritual world by His internal potency and the material world by His external potency. By His all-pervading features He is everywhere present as the Supreme Truth, and in His personal feature He is always present in His transcendental abode of Goloka V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, where He displays His transcendental pastimes in all variegatedness. His activities cannot be compared to anyone else's, and therefore the word <span class="Italic">urukrama</span> is just applicable to Him only.</div>
<div class="Purport">According to Sanskrit verbal arrangement, <span class="Italic">kurvanti</span> refers to doing things for someone else. Therefore, it means that the <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;r&#257;mas</span> render devotional service unto the Lord not for personal interest but for the pleasure of the Lord, Urukrama.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Hetu</span> means "causal." There are many causes for one's sense satisfaction, and they can be chiefly classified as material enjoyment, mystic powers and liberation, which are generally desired by progressive persons. As far as material enjoyments are concerned, they are innumerable, and the materialists are eager to increase them more and more because they are under the illusory energy. There is no end to the list of material enjoyments, nor can anyone in the material universe have all of them. As far as the mystic powers are concerned, they are eight in all (such as to become the minutest in form, to become weightless, to have anything one desires, to lord it over the material nature, to control other living beings, to throw earthly globes in outer space, etc.). These mystic powers are mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> The forms of liberation are five in number.</div>
<div class="Purport">Therefore, unalloyed devotion means service to the Lord without desire for the above-mentioned personal benefits. And the powerful Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a can be fully satisfied by such unalloyed devotees free from all sorts of desires for personal benefit.</div>
<div class="Purport">Unalloyed devotional service of the Lord progresses in different stages. Practice of devotional service in the material field is of eighty-one different qualities, and above such activities is the transcendental practice of devotional service, which is one and is called <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhana-bhakti.</span> When unalloyed practice of <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhana-bhakti</span> is matured into transcendental love for the Lord, the transcendental loving service of the Lord begins gradually developing into nine progressive stages of loving service under the headings of attachment, love, affection, feelings, affinity, adherence, following, ecstasy, and intense feelings of separation.</div>
<div class="Purport">The attachment of an inactive devotee develops up to the stage of transcendental love of God. Attachment of an active servitor develops up to the stage of adherence, and that for a friendly devotee develops up to the stage of following, and the same is also the case for the paternal devotees. Devotees in conjugal love develop ecstasy up to the stage of intense feelings of separation. These are some of the features of unalloyed devotional service of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purport">According to <span class="Italic">Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya,</span> the import of the word <span class="Italic">ittham-bh&#363;ta</span> is "complete bliss." Transcendental bliss in the realization of impersonal Brahman becomes comparable to the scanty water contained in the pit made by a cow's hoof. It is nothing compared with the ocean of bliss of the vision of the Personality of Godhead. The personal form of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is so attractive that it comprehends all attraction, all bliss and all tastes (<span class="Italic">rasas</span>). These attractions are so strong that <span class="Italic">no one wants to exchange them for material enjoyment, mystic powers and liberation.</span> There is no need of logical arguments in support of this statement, but out of one's own nature one becomes attracted by the qualities of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. We must know for certain that the qualities of the Lord have nothing to do with mundane qualities. All of them are full of bliss, knowledge and eternity. There are innumerable qualities of the Lord, and one is attracted by one quality while another is attracted by another.</div>
<div class="Purport">Great sages, such as the four bachelor-devotees Sanaka, San&#257;tana, Sananda and Sanat-kum&#257;ra, were attracted by the fragrance of flowers and <span class="Italic">tulas&#299;</span> leaves anointed with the pulp of sandalwood offered at the lotus feet of the Lord. Similarly, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was attracted by the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was already situated in the liberated stage, yet he was attracted by the pastimes of the Lord. This proves that the quality of His pastimes has nothing to do with material affinity. Similarly, the young cowherd damsels were attracted by the bodily features of the Lord, and Rukmi&#7751;&#299; was attracted by hearing about the glories of the Lord. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a attracts even the mind of the goddess of fortune. He attracts, in special cases, the minds of all young girls. He attracts the minds of the elderly ladies by paternal affection. He attracts the minds of the male in the humors of servitude and friendship.</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">hari</span> conveys various meanings, but the chief import of the word is that He (the Lord) vanquishes everything inauspicious and takes away the mind of the devotee by awarding pure transcendental love. By remembering the Lord in acute distress one can be free from all varieties of miseries and anxieties. Gradually the Lord vanquishes all obstacles on the path of devotional service of a pure devotee, and the result of nine devotional activities, such as hearing and chanting, becomes manifested.</div>
<div class="Purport">By His personal features and transcendental attributes, the Lord attracts all psychological activities of a pure devotee. Such is the attractive power of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The attraction is so powerful that a pure devotee never hankers for any one of the four principles of religion. These are the attractive features of the transcendental attributes of the Lord. And adding to this the words <span class="Italic">api</span> and <span class="Italic">ca,</span> one can increase the imports unlimitedly. According to Sanskrit grammar there are seven synonyms for the word <span class="Italic">api.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">So by interpreting each and every word of this <span class="Italic">&#347;loka,</span> one can see unlimited numbers of transcendental qualities of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a that attract the mind of a pure devotee.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">&#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, son of &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva, was not only transcendentally powerful. He was also very dear to the devotees of the Lord. Thus he underwent the study of this great narration [&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam].</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to <span class="Italic">Brahma-vaivarta Pur&#257;&#7751;a,</span> &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was a liberated soul even within the womb of his mother. &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva knew that the child, after his birth, would not stay at home. Therefore he (Vy&#257;sadeva) impressed upon him the synopsis of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> so that the child could be made attached to the transcendental activities of the Lord. After his birth, the child was still more educated in the subject of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> by recitation of the actual poems.</div>
<div class="Purport">The idea is that generally the liberated souls are attached to the feature of impersonal Brahman with a monistic view of becoming one with the supreme whole. But by the association of pure devotees like Vy&#257;sadeva, even the liberated soul becomes attracted to the transcendental qualities of the Lord. By the mercy of &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada, &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva was able to narrate the great epic of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> and by the mercy of Vy&#257;sadeva, &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was able to grasp the import. The transcendental qualities of the Lord are so attractive that &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; became detached from being completely absorbed in impersonal Brahman and positively took up the personal activity of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purport">Practically he was thrown from the impersonal conception of the Absolute, thinking within himself that he had simply wasted so much time in devoting himself to the impersonal feature of the Supreme, or in other words, he realized more transcendental bliss with the personal feature than the impersonal. And from that time, not only did he himself become very dear to the <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-janas,</span> or the devotees of the Lord, but also the <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-janas</span> became very dear to him. The devotees of the Lord, who do not wish to kill the individuality of the living entities and who desire to become personal servitors of the Lord, do not very much like the impersonalists, and similarly the impersonalists, who desire to become one with the Supreme, are unable to evaluate the devotees of the Lord. Thus from time immemorial these two transcendental pilgrims have sometimes been competitors. In other words, each of them likes to keep separate from the other because of the ultimate personal and impersonal realizations. Therefore it appears that &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; also had no liking for the devotees. But since he himself became a saturated devotee, he desired always the transcendental association of the <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-janas,</span> and the <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-janas</span> also liked his association, since he became a personal <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata.</span> Thus both the son and the father were completely cognizant of transcendental knowledge in Brahman, and afterwards both of them became absorbed in the personal features of the Supreme Lord. The question as to how &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was attracted by the narration of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is thus completely answered by this <span class="Italic">&#347;loka.</span></div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is so kind to the fallen souls that He personally incarnates Himself amongst the different kinds of living entities and takes part with them in daily activities. Any historical fact old or new which has a connection with the activities of the Lord is to be understood as a transcendental narration of the Lord. Without K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, all the supplementary literatures like the <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> and <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> are simply stories or historical facts. But with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a they become transcendental, and when we hear of them we at once become transcendentally related with the Lord. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is also a <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;a,</span> but the special significance of this <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> is that the activities of the Lord are central and not just supplementary historical facts. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is thus recommended by Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu as the spotless <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;a.</span> There is a class of less intelligent devotees of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> who desire to relish at once the activities of the Lord narrated in the Tenth Canto without first understanding the primary cantos. They are under the false impression that the other cantos are not concerned with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and thus more foolishly than intelligently they take to the reading of the Tenth Canto. These readers are specifically told herein that the other cantos of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> are as important as the Tenth Canto. No one should try to go into the matters of the Tenth Canto without having thoroughly understood the purport of the other nine cantos. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and His pure devotees like the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas are on the same plane. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is not without His devotees of all the <span class="Italic">rasas,</span> and the pure devotees like the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas are not without K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The devotees and the Lord are interlinked, and they cannot be separated. Therefore talks about them are all <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-kath&#257;,</span> or topics of the Lord.</div>

<div class="First">The Lord states in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> that one who surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Lord can get release from the clutches of nescience. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is just like the sun, and <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> or material existence is just like darkness. Wherever there is the light of the sun, darkness or ignorance at once vanishes. The best means to get out of the world of ignorance is suggested here. The Lord is addressed herein as the original Personality of Godhead. From Him all other Personalities of Godhead expand. The all-pervasive Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's plenary portion or expansion. The Lord expands Himself in innumerable forms of Godhead and living beings, along with His different energies. But &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the original primeval Lord from whom everything emanates. The all-pervasive feature of the Lord experienced within the manifested world is also a partial representation of the Lord. Param&#257;tm&#257;, therefore, is included within Him. He is the Absolute Personality of Godhead. He has nothing to do with the actions and reactions of the material manifestation because He is far above the material creation. Darkness is a perverse representation of the sun, and therefore the existence of darkness depends on the existence of the sun, but in the sun proper there is no trace of darkness. As the sun is full of light only, similarly the Absolute Personality of Godhead, beyond the material existence, is full of bliss. He is not only full of bliss, but also full of transcendental variegatedness. Transcendence is not at all static, but full of dynamic variegatedness. He is distinct from the material nature, which is complicated by the three modes of material nature. He is <span class="Italic">parama,</span> or the chief. Therefore He is absolute. He has manifold energies, and through His diverse energies He creates, manifests, maintains and destroys the material world. In His own abode, however, everything is eternal and absolute. The world is not conducted by the energies or powerful agents by themselves, but by the potent all-powerful with all energies.</div>

<div class="Translation">A cruel and wretched person who maintains his existence at the cost of others' lives deserves to be killed for his own well-being, otherwise he will go down by his own actions.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">A life for a life is just punishment for a person who cruelly and shamelessly lives at the cost of another's life. Political morality is to punish a person by a death sentence in order to save a cruel person from going to hell. That a murderer is condemned to a death sentence by the state is good for the culprit because in his next life he will not have to suffer for his act of murder. Such a death sentence for the murderer is the lowest possible punishment offered to him, and it is said in the <span class="Italic">sm&#7771;ti-&#347;&#257;stras</span> that men who are punished by the king on the principle of a life for a life are purified of all their sins, so much so that they may be eligible for being promoted to the planets of heaven. According to Manu, the great author of civic codes and religious principles, even the killer of an animal is to be considered a murderer because animal food is never meant for the civilized man, whose prime duty is to prepare himself for going back to Godhead. He says that in the act of killing an animal, there is a regular conspiracy by the party of sinners, and all of them are liable to be punished as murderers exactly like a party of conspirators who kill a human being combinedly. <span class="Italic">He who gives permission, he who kills the animal, he who sells the slaughtered animal, he who cooks the animal, he who administers distribution of the foodstuff, and at last he who eats such cooked animal food are all murderers, and all of them are liable to be punished by the laws of nature.</span> No one can create a living being despite all advancement of material science, and therefore no one has the right to kill a living being by one's independent whims. For the animal-eaters, the scriptures have sanctioned restricted animal sacrifices only, and such sanctions are there just to restrict the opening of slaughterhouses and not to encourage animal killing. The procedure under which animal sacrifice is allowed in the scriptures is good both for the animal sacrificed and the animal-eaters. It is good for the animal in the sense that the sacrificed animal is at once promoted to the human form of life after being sacrificed at the altar, and the animal-eater is saved from grosser types of sins (eating meats supplied by organized slaughterhouses which are ghastly places for breeding all kinds of material afflictions to society, country and the people in general). The material world is itself a place always full of anxieties, and by encouraging animal slaughter the whole atmosphere becomes polluted more and more by war, pestilence, famine and many other unwanted calamities.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">As soon as A&#347;vatth&#257;m&#257; was brought before Draupad&#299;, she thought it intolerable that a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> should be arrested like a culprit and brought before her in that condition, especially when the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> happened to be a teacher's son.</div>
<div class="Purport">Arjuna arrested A&#347;vatth&#257;m&#257; knowing perfectly well that he was the son of Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a also knew him to be so, but both of them condemned the murderer without consideration of his being the son of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> According to revealed scriptures, a teacher or spiritual master is liable to be rejected if he proves himself unworthy of the position of a <span class="Italic">guru</span> or spiritual master. A <span class="Italic">guru</span> is called also an <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya,</span> or a person who has personally assimilated all the essence of <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> and has helped his disciples to adopt the ways. A&#347;vatth&#257;m&#257; failed to discharge the duties of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> or teacher, and therefore he was liable to be rejected from the exalted position of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> On this consideration, both Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and Arjuna were right in condemning A&#347;vatth&#257;m&#257;. But to a good lady like Draupad&#299;, the matter was considered not from the angle of <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stric</span> vision, but as a matter of custom. By custom, A&#347;vatth&#257;m&#257; was offered the same respect as offered to his father. It was so because generally the people accept the son of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> as a real <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> by sentiment only. Factually the matter is different. A <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> is accepted on the merit of qualification and not on the merit of simply being the son of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">But in spite of all this, Draupad&#299; desired that A&#347;vatth&#257;m&#257; be at once released, and it was all the same a good sentiment for her. This means that a devotee of the Lord can tolerate all sorts of tribulation personally, but still such devotees are never unkind to others, even to the enemy. These are the characteristics of one who is a pure devotee of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"><span class="Italic">Dhanur-veda,</span> or military science, was taught by Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya with all its confidential secrets of throwing and controlling by Vedic hymns. Gross military science is dependent on material weapons, but finer than that is the art of throwing the arrows saturated with Vedic hymns, which act more effectively than gross material weapons like machine guns or atomic bombs. The control is by Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras,</span> or the transcendental science of sound. It is said in the <span class="Italic">R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</span> that Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Da&#347;aratha, the father of Lord &#346;r&#299; R&#257;ma, used to control arrows by sound only. He could pierce his target with his arrow by only hearing the sound, without seeing the object. So this is a finer military science than that of the gross material military weapons used nowadays. Arjuna was taught all this, and therefore Draupad&#299; wished that Arjuna feel obliged to &#256;c&#257;rya Dro&#7751;a for all these benefits. And in the absence of Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya, his son was his representative. That was the opinion of the good lady Draupad&#299;. It may be argued why Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya, a rigid <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> should be a teacher in military science. But the reply is that a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> should become a teacher, regardless of what his department of knowledge is. A learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> should become a teacher, a priest and a recipient of charity. A bona fide <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> is authorized to accept such professions.</div>

One should not tolerate the humiliation of a member of a great family. Arjuna and his family were indebted to the family of Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya because of Arjuna's learning the military science from him. If ingratitude were shown to such a benevolent family, it would not be at all justified from the moral standpoint. The wife of Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya, who was the half body of the great soul, must be treated with compassion, and she should not be put into grief because of her son's death. That is compassion. Such statements by Draupad&#299; are without duplicity because actions should be taken with full knowledge. The feeling of equality was there because Draupad&#299; spoke out of her personal experience. A barren woman cannot understand the grief of a mother. Draupad&#299; was herself a mother, and therefore her calculation of the depth of K&#7771;p&#299;'s grief was quite to the point.

Originally, the primeval Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a displays only two arms, but in His N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a feature He exhibits four. In His N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a feature He resides with His devotees in the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets, while in His original &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a feature He resides in the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;aloka planet far, far above the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets in the spiritual sky. Therefore, if &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is called <span class="Italic">caturbhuja&#7717;,</span> there is no contradiction. If need be He can display hundreds of arms, as He exhibited in His <span class="Italic">vi&#347;va-r&#363;pa</span> shown to Arjuna. Therefore, one who can display hundreds and thousands of arms can also manifest four whenever needed.</div>
<div class="Purport">When Arjuna was perplexed about what to do with A&#347;vatth&#257;m&#257;, Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, as the very dear friend of Arjuna, voluntarily took up the matter just to make a solution. And He was smiling also.</div>

<div class="Translation">The Personality of Godhead Sri K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a said: A friend of a br&#257;hma&#7751;a is not to be killed, but if he is an aggressor he must be killed.

<div class="First">Arjuna was perplexed because A&#347;vatth&#257;m&#257; was to be killed as well as spared according to different scriptures cited by different persons. As a <span class="Italic">brahma-bandhu,</span> or a worthless son of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> A&#347;vatth&#257;m&#257; was not to be killed, but he was at the same time an aggressor also. And according to the rulings of Manu, an aggressor, even though he be a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> (and what to speak of an unworthy son of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span>), is to be killed.

But although A&#347;vatth&#257;m&#257; was an aggressor, he stood without any fighting weapons. The ruling is that an aggressor, when he is without weapon or chariot, cannot be killed. All these were certainly perplexities. Besides that, Arjuna had to keep the promise he had made before Draupad&#299; just to pacify her. And he also had to satisfy both Bh&#299;ma and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who advised killing him. This dilemma was present before Arjuna, and the solution was awarded by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The stringent laws of nature, under the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, cannot be altered by any living entity. The living entities are eternally under the subjugation of the almighty Lord. The Lord makes all the laws and orders, and these laws and orders are generally called <span class="Italic">dharma</span> or religion. No one can create any religious formula. Bona fide religion is to abide by the orders of the Lord. The Lord's orders are clearly declared in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> Everyone should follow Him only or His orders, and that will make all happy, both materially and spiritually. As long as we are in the material world, our duty is to follow the orders of the Lord, and if by the grace of the Lord we are liberated from the clutches of the material world, then in our liberated stage also we can render transcendental loving service unto the Lord. In our material stage we can see neither ourselves nor the Lord for want of spiritual vision. But when we are liberated from material affection and are situated in our original spiritual form we can see both ourselves and the Lord face to face. <span class="Italic">Mukti</span> means to be reinstated in one's original spiritual status after giving up the material conception of life. Therefore, human life is specifically meant for qualifying ourselves for this spiritual liberty. Unfortunately, under the influence of illusory material energy, we accept this spot-life of only a few years as our permanent existence and thus become illusioned by possessing so-called country, home, land, children, wife, community, wealth, etc., which are false representations created by <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> (illusion). And under the dictation of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> we fight with one another to protect these false possessions. By cultivating spiritual knowledge, we can realize that we have nothing to do with all this material paraphernalia. Then at once we become free from material attachment. This clearance of the misgivings of material existence at once takes place by association with the Lord's devotees, who are able to inject the transcendental sound into the depths of the bewildered heart and thus make one practically liberated from all lamentation and illusion. That is a summary of the pacifying measures for those affected by the reaction of stringent material laws, exhibited in the forms of birth, death, old age and disease, which are insoluble factors of material existence. The victims of war, namely, the family members of the Kurus, were lamenting the problems of death, and the Lord pacified them on the basis of knowledge.</div>

<div class="Translation">The clever Duryodhana and his party cunningly usurped the kingdom of Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, who had no enemy.

<div class="First">In the glorious days, or before the advent of the age of Kali, the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> the cows, the women, the children and the old men were properly given protection.</div>
<div class="Purport">1. The protection of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> maintains the institution of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama,</span> the most scientific culture for attainment of spiritual life.</div>
<div class="Purport">2. The protection of cows maintains the most miraculous form of food, i.e., milk for maintaining the finer tissues of the brain for understanding higher aims of life.</div>
<div class="Purport">3. The protection of women maintains the chastity of society, by which we can get a good generation for peace, tranquillity and progress of life.</div>
<div class="Purport">4. The protection of children gives the human form of life its best chance to prepare the way of liberty from material bondage. Such protection of children begins from the very day of begetting a child by the purificatory process of <span class="Italic">garbh&#257;dh&#257;na-sa&#7745;sk&#257;ra,</span> the beginning of pure life.</div>
<div class="Purport">5. The protection of the old men gives them a chance to prepare themselves for better life after death.</div>
<div class="Purport">This complete outlook is based on factors leading to successful humanity as against the civilization of polished cats and dogs. The killing of the above-mentioned innocent creatures is totally forbidden because even by insulting them one loses one's duration of life. In the age of Kali they are not properly protected, and therefore the duration of life of the present generation has shortened considerably. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is stated that when the women become unchaste for want of proper protection, there are unwanted children called <span class="Italic">var&#7751;a-sa&#7749;kara.</span> To insult a chaste woman means to bring about disaster in the duration of life. Du&#7717;&#347;&#257;sana, a brother of Duryodhana, insulted Draupad&#299;, an ideal chaste lady, and therefore the miscreants died untimely. These are some of the stringent laws of the Lord mentioned above.</div>

The reason is that Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira was a pure devotee of the Lord, and by His grace only was King Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira on the level of the King of heaven, even though he performed only three <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;as</span> whereas the King of heaven performed hundreds. That is the prerogative of the devotee of the Lord. The Lord is equal to everyone, but a devotee of the Lord is more glorified because he is always in touch with the all-great. The sun rays are equally distributed, but still there are some places which are always dark. This is not due to the sun but to the receptive power. Similarly, those who are cent percent devotees of the Lord get the full-fledged mercy of the Lord, which is always equally distributed everywhere.</div>

But the Lord neglects even the greatest warriors and also vanquishes them in no time. When the Lord saw that there was no time for the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas to counteract the <span class="Italic">brahm&#257;stra</span> of A&#347;vatth&#257;m&#257;, He took up His weapon even at the risk of breaking His own vow. Although the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra was almost finished, still, according to His vow, He should not have taken up His own weapon. But the emergency was more important than the vow. He is better known as the <span class="Italic">bhakta-vatsala,</span> or the lover of His devotee, and thus He preferred to continue as <span class="Italic">bhakta-vatsala</span> than to be a worldly moralist who never breaks his solemn vow.</div>

You are existing both within and without everything, yet You are invisible to all.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">&#346;r&#299;mat&#299; Kunt&#299;dev&#299; was quite aware that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the original Personality of Godhead, although He was playing the part of her nephew. Such an enlightened lady could not commit a mistake by offering obeisances unto her nephew. Therefore, she addressed Him as the original <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a</span> beyond the material cosmos. Although all living entities are also transcendental, they are neither original nor infallible. The living entities are apt to fall down under the clutches of material nature, but the Lord is never like that. In the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> therefore, He is described as the chief among all living entities (<span class="Italic">nityo nity&#257;n&#257;&#7745; cetana&#347; cetan&#257;n&#257;m</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Ka&#7789;ha Upani&#7779;ad</span></B> 2.2.13)). Then again He is addressed as <span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;vara,</span> or the controller. The living entities or the demigods like Candra and S&#363;rya are also to some extent <span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;vara,</span> but none of them is the supreme <span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;vara,</span> or the ultimate controller. He is the <span class="Italic">parame&#347;vara,</span> or the Supersoul. He is both within and without. Although He was present before &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; Kunt&#299; as her nephew, He was also within her and everyone else. In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a>) the Lord says, "I am situated in everyone's heart, and only due to Me one remembers, forgets and is cognizant, etc. Through all the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> I am to be known because I am the compiler of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> and I am the teacher of the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta.</span>" Queen Kunt&#299; affirms that the Lord, although both within and without all living beings, is still invisible. The Lord is, so to speak, a puzzle for the common man. Queen Kunt&#299; experienced personally that Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was present before her, yet He entered within the womb of Uttar&#257; to save her embryo from the attack of A&#347;vatth&#257;m&#257;'s <span class="Italic">brahm&#257;stra.</span> Kunt&#299; herself was puzzled about whether &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is all-pervasive or localized. In fact, He is both, but He reserves the right of not being exposed to persons who are not surrendered souls. This checking curtain is called the <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> energy of the Supreme Lord, and it controls the limited vision of the rebellious soul. It is explained as follows.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a affirms that less intelligent persons mistake Him to be an ordinary man like us, and thus they deride Him. The same is confirmed herein by Queen Kunt&#299;. The less intelligent persons are those who rebel against the authority of the Lord. Such persons are known as <span class="Italic">asuras.</span> The <span class="Italic">asuras</span> cannot recognize the Lord's authority. When the Lord Himself appears amongst us, as R&#257;ma, N&#7771;si&#7745;ha, Var&#257;ha or in His original form as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, He performs many wonderful acts which are humanly impossible. As we shall find in the Tenth Canto of this great literature, Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a exhibited His humanly impossible activities even from the days of His lying on the lap of His mother. He killed the P&#363;tan&#257; witch, although she smeared her breast with poison just to kill the Lord. The Lord sucked her breast like a natural baby, and He sucked out her very life also. Similarly, He lifted the Govardhana Hill, just as a boy picks up a frog's umbrella, and stood several days continuously just to give protection to the residents of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana. These are some of the superhuman activities of the Lord described in the authoritative Vedic literatures like the <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as, Itih&#257;sas</span> (histories) and <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads.</span> He has delivered wonderful instructions in the shape of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> He has shown marvelous capacities as a hero, as a householder, as a teacher and as a renouncer. He is accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead by such authoritative personalities as Vy&#257;sa, Devala, Asita, N&#257;rada, Madhva, &#346;a&#7749;kara, R&#257;m&#257;nuja, &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;, Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299;, Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; and all other authorities of the line. He Himself has declared as much in many places of the authentic literatures. And yet there is a class of men with demoniac mentality who are always reluctant to accept the Lord as the Supreme Absolute Truth. This is partially due to their poor fund of knowledge and partially due to their stubborn obstinacy, which results from various misdeeds in the past and present. Such persons could not recognize Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a even when He was present before them. Another difficulty is that those who depend more on their imperfect senses cannot realize Him as the Supreme Lord. Such persons are like the modern scientist. They want to know everything by their experimental knowledge. But it is not possible to know the Supreme Person by imperfect experimental knowledge. He is described herein as <span class="Italic">adhok&#7779;aja,</span> or beyond the range of experimental knowledge. All our senses are imperfect. We claim to observe everything and anything, but we must admit that we can observe things under certain material conditions only, which are also beyond our control. The Lord is beyond the observation of sense perception. Queen Kunt&#299; accepts this deficiency of the conditioned soul, especially of the woman class, who are less intelligent. For less intelligent men there must be such things as temples, mosques or churches so that they may begin to recognize the authority of the Lord and hear about Him from authorities in such holy places. For less intelligent men, this beginning of spiritual life is essential, and only foolish men decry the establishment of such places of worship, which are required to raise the standard of spiritual attributes for the mass of people. For less intelligent persons, bowing down before the authority of the Lord, as generally done in the temples, mosques or churches, is as beneficial as it is for the advanced devotees to meditate upon Him by active service.</div>

<div class="First">Even the greatest philosophical speculators cannot have access to the region of the Lord. It is said in the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads</span> that the Supreme Truth, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, is beyond the range of the thinking power of the greatest philosopher. He is unknowable by great learning or by the greatest brain. He is knowable only by one who has His mercy. Others may go on thinking about Him for years together, yet He is unknowable. This very fact is corroborated by the Queen, who is playing the part of an innocent woman. Women in general are unable to speculate like philosophers, but they are blessed by the Lord because they believe at once in the superiority and almightiness of the Lord, and thus they offer obeisances without reservation. The Lord is so kind that He does not show special favor only to one who is a great philosopher. He knows the sincerity of purpose. For this reason only, women generally assemble in great number in any sort of religious function. In every country and in every sect of religion it appears that the women are more interested than the men. This simplicity of acceptance of the Lord's authority is more effective than showy insincere religious fervor.</div>

<div class="Translation">Let me therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto the Lord, who has become the son of Vasudeva, the pleasure of Devak&#299;, the boy of Nanda and the other cowherd men of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, and the enlivener of the cows and the senses.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Lord, being thus unapproachable by any material assets, out of unbounded and causeless mercy descends on the earth as He is in order to show His special mercy upon His unalloyed devotees and to diminish the upsurges of the demoniac persons. Queen Kunt&#299; specifically adores the incarnation or descent of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a above all other incarnations because in this particular incarnation He is more approachable. In the R&#257;ma incarnation He remained a king's son from His very childhood, but in the incarnation of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, although He was the son of a king, He at once left the shelter of His real father and mother (King Vasudeva and Queen Devak&#299;) just after His appearance and went to the lap of Ya&#347;od&#257;m&#257;y&#299; to play the part of an ordinary cowherd boy in the blessed Vrajabh&#363;mi, which is very sanctified because of His childhood pastimes. Therefore Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is more merciful than Lord R&#257;ma. He was undoubtedly very kind to Kunt&#299;'s brother Vasudeva and the family. Had He not become the son of Vasudeva and Devak&#299;, Queen Kunt&#299; could not claim Him to be her nephew and thus address K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in parental affection. But Nanda and Ya&#347;od&#257; are more fortunate because they could relish the Lord's childhood pastimes, which are more attractive than all other pastimes. There is no parallel to His childhood pastimes as exhibited at Vrajabh&#363;mi, which are the prototypes of His eternal affairs in the original K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;aloka described as the <span class="Italic">cint&#257;ma&#7751;i-dh&#257;ma</span> in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</I> [</I>Bs</I>. </span></I>5.29</I>]<span class="Italic"></I>.</span> Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a descended Himself at Vrajabh&#363;mi with all His transcendental entourage and paraphernalia. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu therefore confirmed that no one is as fortunate as the residents of Vrajabh&#363;mi, and specifically the cowherd girls, who dedicated their everything for the satisfaction of the Lord. His pastimes with Nanda and Ya&#347;od&#257; and His pastimes with the cowherd men and especially with the cowherd boys and the cows have caused Him to be known as Govinda. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as Govinda is more inclined to the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and the cows, indicating thereby that human prosperity depends more on these two items, namely brahminical culture and cow protection.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Here are some of the specific symbolical marks on the spiritual body of the Personality of Godhead which distinguish His body from the bodies of all others. They are all special features of the body of the Lord. The Lord may appear as one of us, but He is always distinct by His specific bodily features. &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; Kunt&#299; claims herself unfit to see the Lord because of her being a woman. This is claimed because women, <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> (the laborer class) and the <span class="Italic">dvija-bandhus,</span> or the wretched descendants of the higher three classes, are unfit by intelligence to understand transcendental subject matter concerning the spiritual name, fame, attributes, forms, etc., of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Such persons, although they are unfit to enter into the spiritual affairs of the Lord, can see Him as the <span class="Italic">arc&#257;-vigraha,</span> who descends on the material world just to distribute favors to the fallen souls, including the above-mentioned women, <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> and <span class="Italic">dvija-bandhus.</span> Because such fallen souls cannot see anything beyond matter, the Lord condescends to enter into each and every one of the innumerable universes as the Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, who grows a lotus stem from the lotuslike depression in the center of His transcendental abdomen, and thus Brahm&#257;, the first living being in the universe, is born. Therefore, the Lord is known as the Pa&#7749;kajan&#257;bhi. The Pa&#7749;kajan&#257;bhi Lord accepts the <span class="Italic">arc&#257;-vigraha</span> (His transcendental form) in different elements, namely a form within the mind, a form made of wood, a form made of earth, a form made of metal, a form made of jewel, a form made of paint, a form drawn on sand, etc. All such forms of the Lord are always decorated with garlands of lotus flowers, and there should be a soothing atmosphere in the temple of worship to attract the burning attention of the nondevotees always engaged in material wranglings. The meditators worship a form within the mind. Therefore, the Lord is merciful even to the women, <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> and <span class="Italic">dvija-bandhus,</span> provided they agree to visit the temple of worship in different forms made for them. Such temple visitors are not idolaters, as alleged by some men with a poor fund of knowledge. All the great <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> established such temples of worship in all places just to favor the less intelligent, and one should not pose himself as transcending the stage of temple worship while one is actually in the category of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> and the women or less. One should begin to see the Lord from His lotus feet, gradually rising to the thighs, waist, chest and face. One should not try to look at the face of the Lord without being accustomed to seeing the lotus feet of the Lord. &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; Kunt&#299;, because of her being the aunt of the Lord, did not begin to see the Lord from the lotus feet because the Lord might feel ashamed, and thus Kunt&#299;dev&#299;, just to save a painful situation for the Lord, began to see the Lord just above His lotus feet, i.e., from the waist of the Lord, gradually rising to the face, and then down to the lotus feet. In the round, everything there is in order.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Devak&#299;, the mother of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and sister of King Ka&#7745;sa, was put into prison along with her husband, Vasudeva, because the envious King was afraid of being killed by Devak&#299;'s eighth son (K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a). He killed all the sons of Devak&#299; who were born before K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, but K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a escaped the danger of child-slaughter because He was transferred to the house of Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's foster father. Kunt&#299;dev&#299;, along with her children, was also saved from a series of dangers. But Kunt&#299;dev&#299; was shown far more favor because Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a did not save the other children of Devak&#299;, whereas He saved the children of Kunt&#299;dev&#299;. This was done because Devak&#299;'s husband, Vasudeva, was living, whereas Kunt&#299;dev&#299; was a widow, and there was none to help her except K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The conclusion is that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a endows more favor to a devotee who is in greater dangers. Sometimes He puts His pure devotees in such dangers because in that condition of helplessness the devotee becomes more attached to the Lord. The more the attachment is there for the Lord, the more success is there for the devotee.</div>

<div class="First">Generally the distressed, the needy, the intelligent and the inquisitive, who have performed some pious activities, worship or begin to worship the Lord. Others, who are thriving on misdeeds only, regardless of status, cannot approach the Supreme due to being misled by the illusory energy. Therefore, for a pious person, if there is some calamity there is no other alternative than to take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord. Constantly remembering the lotus feet of the Lord means preparing for liberation from birth and death. Therefore, even though there are so-called calamities, they are welcome because they give us an opportunity to remember the Lord, which means liberation.</div>
<div class="Purport">One who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord, which are accepted as the most suitable boat for crossing the ocean of nescience, can achieve liberation as easily as one leaps over the holes made by the hoofs of a calf. Such persons are meant to reside in the abode of the Lord, and they have nothing to do with a place where there is danger in every step.</div>
<div class="Purport">This material world is certified by the Lord in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as a dangerous place full of calamities. Less intelligent persons prepare plans to adjust to those calamities without knowing that the nature of this place is itself full of calamities. They have no information of the abode of the Lord, which is full of bliss and without trace of calamity. The duty of the sane person, therefore, is to be undisturbed by worldly calamities, which are sure to happen in all circumstances. Suffering all sorts of unavoidable misfortunes, one should make progress in spiritual realization because that is the mission of human life. The spirit soul is transcendental to all material calamities; therefore, the so-called calamities are called false. A man may see a tiger swallowing him in a dream, and he may cry for this calamity. Actually there is no tiger and there is no suffering; it is simply a case of dreams. In the same way, all calamities of life are said to be dreams. If someone is lucky enough to get in contact with the Lord by devotional service, it is all gain. Contact with the Lord by any one of the nine devotional services is always a forward step on the path going back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">My Lord, Your Lordship can easily be approached, but only by those who are materially exhausted. One who is on the path of [material] progress, trying to improve himself with respectable parentage, great opulence, high education and bodily beauty, cannot approach You with sincere feeling.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Being materially advanced means taking birth in an aristocratic family and possessing great wealth, an education and attractive personal beauty. All materialistic men are mad after possessing all these material opulences, and this is known as the advancement of material civilization. But the result is that by possessing all these material assets one becomes artificially puffed up, intoxicated by such temporary possessions. Consequently, such materially puffed up persons are incapable of uttering the holy name of the Lord by addressing Him feelingly, "O Govinda, O K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a." It is said in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> that by once uttering the holy name of the Lord, the sinner gets rid of a quantity of sins that he is unable to commit. Such is the power of uttering the holy name of the Lord. There is not the least exaggeration in this statement. Actually the Lord's holy name has such powerful potency. But there is a quality to such utterances also. It depends on the quality of feeling. A helpless man can feelingly utter the holy name of the Lord, whereas a man who utters the same holy name in great material satisfaction cannot be so sincere. A materially puffed up person may utter the holy name of the Lord occasionally, but he is incapable of uttering the name in quality. Therefore, the four principles of material advancement, namely (1) high parentage, (2) good wealth, (3) high education and (4) attractive beauty, are, so to speak, disqualifications for progress on the path of spiritual advancement. The material covering of the pure spirit soul is an external feature, as much as fever is an external feature of the unhealthy body. The general process is to decrease the degree of the fever and not to aggravate it by maltreatment. Sometimes it is seen that spiritually advanced persons become materially impoverished. This is no discouragement. On the other hand, such impoverishment is a good sign as much as the falling of temperature is a good sign. The principle of life should be to decrease the degree of material intoxication which leads one to be more and more illusioned about the aim of life. Grossly illusioned persons are quite unfit for entrance into the kingdom of God.</div>

<div class="First">A living being is finished as soon as there is nothing to possess. Therefore a living being cannot be, in the real sense of the term, a renouncer. A living being renounces something for gaining something more valuable. A student sacrifices his childish proclivities to gain better education. A servant gives up his job for a better job. Similarly, a devotee renounces the material world not for nothing but for something tangible in spiritual value. &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299;, San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299; and &#346;r&#299;la Raghun&#257;tha d&#257;sa Gosv&#257;m&#299; and others gave up their worldly pomp and prosperity for the sake of the service of the Lord.

But they left everything to gain something superior to what they previously possessed. The devotees are generally without material prosperity, but they have a very secret treasure-house in the lotus feet of the Lord. There is a nice story about &#346;r&#299;la San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299;. He had a touchstone with him, and this stone was left in a pile of refuse. A needy man took it, but later on wondered why the valuable stone was kept in such a neglected place. He therefore asked him for the most valuable thing, and then he was given the holy name of the Lord. <span class="Italic">Aki&ntilde;cana</span> means one who has nothing to give materially. A factual devotee, or <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;,</span> does not give anything material to anyone because he has already left all material assets. He can, however, deliver the supreme asset, namely the Personality of Godhead, because He is the only property of a factual devotee. The touchstone of San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299;, which was thrown in the rubbish, was not the property of the Gosv&#257;m&#299;, otherwise it would not have been kept in such a place. This specific example is given for the neophyte devotees just to convince them that material hankerings and spiritual advancement go ill together. Unless one is able to see everything as spiritual in relation with the Supreme Lord, one must always distinguish between spirit and matter. A spiritual master like &#346;r&#299;la San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299;, although personally able to see everything as spiritual, set this example for us only because we have no such spiritual vision.</div>
<div class="Purport">Advancement of material vision or material civilization is a great stumbling block for spiritual advancement. Such material advancement entangles the living being in the bondage of a material body followed by all sorts of material miseries. Such material advancement is called <span class="Italic">anartha,</span> or things not wanted. Actually this is so. In the present context of material advancement one uses lipstick at a cost of fifty cents, and there are so many unwanted things which are all products of the material conception of life. By diverting attention to so many unwanted things, human energy is spoiled without achievement of spiritual realization, the prime necessity of human life. The attempt to reach the moon is another example of spoiling energy because even if the moon is reached, the problems of life will not be solved. The devotees of the Lord are called <span class="Italic">aki&ntilde;canas</span> because they have practically no material assets. Such material assets are all products of the three modes of material nature. They foil spiritual energy, and thus the less we possess such products of material nature, the more we have a good chance for spiritual progress.</div>
<div class="Purport">The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no direct connection with material activities. All His acts and deeds, which are exhibited even in this material world, are spiritual and without affection for the modes of material nature. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the Lord says that all His acts, even His appearance and disappearance in and out of the material world, are transcendental, and one who knows this perfectly shall not take his birth again in this material world, but will go back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purport">The material disease is due to hankering after and lording it over material nature. This hankering is due to an interaction of the three modes of nature, and neither the Lord nor the devotees have attachment for such false enjoyment. Therefore, the Lord and the devotees are called <span class="Italic">niv&#7771;tta-gu&#7751;a-v&#7771;tti.</span> The perfect <span class="Italic">niv&#7771;tta-gu&#7751;a-v&#7771;tti</span> is the Supreme Lord because He never becomes attracted by the modes of material nature, whereas the living beings have such a tendency. Some of them are entrapped by the illusory attraction of material nature.</div>
<div class="Purport">Because the Lord is the property of the devotees, and the devotees are the property of the Lord reciprocally, the devotees are certainly transcendental to the modes of material nature. That is a natural conclusion. Such unalloyed devotees are distinct from the mixed devotees who approach the Lord for mitigation of miseries and poverty or because of inquisitiveness and speculation. The unalloyed devotees and the Lord are transcendentally attached to one another. For others, the Lord has nothing to reciprocate, and therefore He is called <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;r&#257;ma,</span> self-satisfied. Self-satisfied as He is, He is the master of all monists who seek to merge into the existence of the Lord. Such monists merge within the personal effulgence of the Lord called the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti,</span> but the devotees enter into the transcendental pastimes of the Lord, which are never to be misunderstood as material.</div>

<div class="Translation">My Lord, I consider Your Lordship to be eternal time, the supreme controller, without beginning and end, the all-pervasive one. In distributing Your mercy, You are equal to everyone. The dissensions between living beings are due to social intercourse.</div>

<div class="First">Kunt&#299;dev&#299; knew that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was neither her nephew nor an ordinary family member of her paternal house. She knew perfectly well that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the primeval Lord who lives in everyone's heart as the Supersoul, Param&#257;tm&#257;. Another name of the Param&#257;tm&#257; feature of the Lord is <span class="Italic">k&#257;la,</span> or eternal time. Eternal time is the witness of all our actions, good and bad, and thus resultant reactions are destined by Him. It is no use saying that we do not know why and for what we are suffering. We may forget the misdeed for which we may suffer at this present moment, but we must remember that Param&#257;tm&#257; is our constant companion, and therefore He knows everything, past, present and future. And because the Param&#257;tm&#257; feature of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a destines all actions and reactions, He is the supreme controller also. Without His sanction not a blade of grass can move. The living beings are given as much freedom as they deserve, and misuse of that freedom is the cause of suffering. The devotees of the Lord do not misuse their freedom, and therefore they are the good sons of the Lord. Others, who misuse freedom, are put into miseries destined by the eternal <span class="Italic">k&#257;la.</span> The <span class="Italic">k&#257;la</span> offers the conditioned souls both happiness and miseries.

Everyone is suffering and enjoying the result of his own destiny. This destiny is made by the living beings in course of social intercourse. Everyone here wants to lord it over the material nature, and thus everyone creates his own destiny under the supervision of the Supreme Lord. He is all-pervading and therefore He can see everyone's activities. And because the Lord has no beginning or end, He is known also as the eternal time, <span class="Italic">k&#257;la.</span></div>

<div class="Translation">O Lord, no one can understand Your transcendental pastimes, which appear to be human and are so misleading. You have no specific object of favor, nor do You have any object of envy. People only imagine that You are partial.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Lord's mercy upon the fallen souls is equally distributed. He has no one as the specific object of hostility. The very conception of the Personality of Godhead as a human being is misleading. His pastimes <span class="Italic">appear</span> to be exactly like a human being's, but actually they are transcendental and without any tinge of material contamination. He is undoubtedly known as partial to His pure devotees, but in fact He is never partial, as much as the sun is never partial to anyone. By utilizing the sun rays, sometimes even the stones become valuable, whereas a blind man cannot see the sun, although there are enough sun rays before him. Darkness and light are two opposite conceptions, but this does not mean that the sun is partial in distributing its rays. The sun rays are open to everyone, but the capacities of the receptacles differ. Foolish people think that devotional service is flattering the Lord to get special mercy. Factually the pure devotees who are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord are not a mercantile community. A mercantile house renders service to someone in exchange for values. The pure devotee does not render service unto the Lord for such exchange, and therefore the full mercy of the Lord is open for him. Suffering and needy men, inquisitive persons or philosophers make temporary connections with the Lord to serve a particular purpose. When the purpose is served, there is no more relation with the Lord. A suffering man, if he is pious at all, prays to the Lord for his recovery. But as soon as the recovery is over, in most cases the suffering man no longer cares to keep any connection with the Lord. The mercy of the Lord is open for him, but he is reluctant to receive it. That is the difference between a pure devotee and a mixed devotee. Those who are completely against the service of the Lord are considered to be in abject darkness, those who ask for the Lord's favor only at the time of necessity are partial recipients of the mercy of the Lord, and those who are cent percent engaged in the service of the Lord are full recipients of the mercy of the Lord. Such partiality in receiving the Lord's mercy is relative to the recipient, and it is not due to the partiality of the all-merciful Lord.</div>
<div class="Purport">When the Lord descends on this material world by His all-merciful energy, He plays like a human being, and therefore it appears that the Lord is partial to His devotees only, but that is not a fact. Despite such apparent manifestation of partiality, His mercy is equally distributed. In the Battlefield of Kuruk&#7779;etra all persons who died in the fight before the presence of the Lord got salvation without the necessary qualifications because death before the presence of the Lord purifies the passing soul from the effects of all sins, and therefore the dying man gets a place somewhere in the transcendental abode. Somehow or other if someone puts himself open in the sun rays, he is sure to get the requisite benefit both by heat and by ultraviolet rays. Therefore, the conclusion is that the Lord is never partial. It is wrong for the people in general to think of Him as partial.</div>

<div class="Translation">Of course it is bewildering, O soul of the universe, that You work, though You are inactive, and that You take birth, though You are the vital force and the unborn. You Yourself descend amongst animals, men, sages and aquatics. Verily, this is bewildering.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The transcendental pastimes of the Lord are not only bewildering but also apparently contradictory. In other words, they are all inconceivable to the limited thinking power of the human being. The Lord is the all-prevailing Supersoul of all existence, and yet He appears in the form of a boar amongst the animals, in the form of a human being as R&#257;ma, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, etc., in the form of a <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;i</span> like N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, and in the form of an aquatic like a fish. Yet it is said that He is unborn, and He has nothing to do. In the <span class="Italic">&#347;ruti mantra</span> it is said that the Supreme Brahman has nothing to do. No one is equal to or greater than Him. He has manifold energies, and everything is performed by Him perfectly by automatic knowledge, strength and activity. All these statements prove without any question that the Lord's activities, forms and deeds are all inconceivable to our limited thinking power, and because He is inconceivably powerful, everything is possible in Him. Therefore no one can calculate Him exactly; every action of the Lord is bewildering to the common man. He cannot be understood by the Vedic knowledge, but He can be easily understood by the pure devotees because they are intimately related with Him. The devotees therefore know that although He appears amongst the animals, He is not an animal, nor a man, nor a <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;i,</span> nor a fish. He is eternally the Supreme Lord, in all circumstances.</div>

<div class="Translation">My dear K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Ya&#347;od&#257; took up a rope to bind You when You committed an offense, and Your perturbed eyes overflooded with tears, which washed the mascara from Your eyes. And You were afraid, though fear personified is afraid of You. This sight is bewildering to me.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Here is another explanation of the bewilderment created by the pastimes of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord is the Supreme in all circumstances, as already explained. Here is a specific example of the Lord's being the Supreme and at the same time a plaything in the presence of His pure devotee. The Lord's pure devotee renders service unto the Lord out of unalloyed love only, and while discharging such devotional service the pure devotee forgets the position of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord also accepts the loving service of His devotees more relishably when the service is rendered spontaneously out of pure affection, without anything of reverential admiration. Generally the Lord is worshiped by the devotees in a reverential attitude, but the Lord is meticulously pleased when the devotee, out of pure affection and love, considers the Lord to be less important than himself. The Lord's pastimes in the original abode of Goloka V&#7771;nd&#257;vana are exchanged in that spirit. The friends of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consider Him one of them. They do not consider Him to be of reverential importance. The parents of the Lord (who are all pure devotees) consider Him a child only. The Lord accepts the chastisements of the parents more cheerfully than the prayers of the Vedic hymns. Similarly, He accepts the reproaches of His fiancees more palatably than the Vedic hymns. When Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was present in this material world to manifest His eternal pastimes of the transcendental realm of Goloka V&#7771;nd&#257;vana as an attraction for the people in general, He displayed a unique picture of subordination before His foster mother, Ya&#347;od&#257;. The Lord, in His naturally childish playful activities, used to spoil the stocked butter of mother Ya&#347;od&#257; by breaking the pots and distributing the contents to His friends and playmates, including the celebrated monkeys of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, who took advantage of the Lord's munificence. Mother Ya&#347;od&#257; saw this, and out of her pure love she wanted to make a show of punishment for her transcendental child. She took a rope and threatened the Lord that she would tie Him up, as is generally done in the ordinary household. Seeing the rope in the hands of mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, the Lord bowed down His head and began to weep just like a child, and tears rolled down His cheeks, washing off the black ointment smeared about His beautiful eyes. This picture of the Lord is adored by Kunt&#299;dev&#299; because she is conscious of the Lord's supreme position. He is feared often by fear personified, yet He is afraid of His mother, who wanted to punish Him just in an ordinary manner. Kunt&#299; was conscious of the exalted position of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, whereas Ya&#347;od&#257; was not. Therefore Ya&#347;od&#257;'s position was more exalted than Kunt&#299;'s. Mother Ya&#347;od&#257; got the Lord as her child, and the Lord made her forget altogether that her child was the Lord Himself. If mother Ya&#347;od&#257; had been conscious of the exalted position of the Lord, she would certainly have hesitated to punish the Lord. But she was made to forget this situation because the Lord wanted to make a complete gesture of childishness before the affectionate Ya&#347;od&#257;. This exchange of love between the mother and the son was performed in a natural way, and Kunt&#299;, remembering the scene, was bewildered, and she could do nothing but praise the transcendental filial love. Indirectly mother Ya&#347;od&#257; is praised for her unique position of love, for she could control even the all-powerful Lord as her beloved child.</div>

<div class="Translation">Some say that the Unborn is born for the glorification of pious kings, and others say that He is born to please King Yadu, one of Your dearest devotees. You appear in his family as sandalwood appears in the Malaya hills.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Because the Lord's appearance in this material world is bewildering, there are different opinions about the birth of the Unborn. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the Lord says that He takes His birth in the material world, although He is the Lord of all creations and He is unborn. So there cannot be any denial of the birth of the Unborn because He Himself establishes the truth. But still there are different opinions as to why He takes His birth. That is also declared in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> He appears by His own internal potency to reestablish the principles of religion and to protect the pious and to annihilate the impious. That is the mission of the appearance of the Unborn. Still, it is said that the Lord is there to glorify the pious King Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira. Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a certainly wanted to establish the kingdom of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas for the good of all in the world. When there is a pious king ruling over the world, the people are happy. When the ruler is impious, the people are unhappy. In the age of Kali in most cases the rulers are impious, and therefore the citizens are also continuously unhappy. But in the case of democracy, the impious citizens themselves elect their representative to rule over them, and therefore they cannot blame anyone for their unhappiness. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Nala was also celebrated as a great pious king, but he had no connection with Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Therefore Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira is meant here to be glorified by Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. He had also glorified King Yadu, having taken His birth in the family. He is known as Y&#257;dava, Yaduv&#299;ra, Yadunandana, etc., although the Lord is always independent of such obligation. He is just like the sandalwood that grows in the Malaya hills. Trees can grow anywhere and everywhere, yet because the sandalwood trees grow mostly in the area of the Malaya hills, the name sandalwood and the Malaya hills are interrelated. Therefore, the conclusion is that the Lord is ever unborn like the sun, and yet He appears as the sun rises on the eastern horizon. As the sun is never the sun of the eastern horizon, so the Lord is no one's son, but He is the father of everything that be.</div>

<div class="First">Brahm&#257;, or the first living being born just after the creation, is the direct son of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, as Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, first of all entered the material universe. Without spiritual contact, matter cannot create. This principle was followed from the very beginning of the creation. The Supreme Spirit entered the universe, and the first living being, Brahm&#257;, was born on a lotus flower grown out of the transcendental abdomen of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is therefore known as Padman&#257;bha. Brahm&#257; is known as <span class="Italic">&#257;tma-bh&#363;</span> because he was begotten directly from the father without any contact of mother Lak&#7779;m&#299;j&#299;. Lak&#7779;m&#299;j&#299; was present near N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, engaged in the service of the Lord, and still, without contact with Lak&#7779;m&#299;j&#299;, N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a begot Brahm&#257;. That is the omnipotency of the Lord. One who foolishly considers N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a like other living beings should take a lesson from this. N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a is not an ordinary living being. He is the Personality of Godhead Himself, and He has all the potencies of all the senses in all parts of His transcendental body. An ordinary living being begets a child by sexual intercourse, and he has no other means to beget a child other than the one designed for him. But N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, being omnipotent, is not bound to any condition of energy. He is complete and independent to do anything and everything by His various potencies, very easily and perfectly. Brahm&#257; is therefore directly the son of the father and was not put into the womb of a mother. Therefore he is known as <span class="Italic">&#257;tma-bh&#363;.</span> This Brahm&#257; is in charge of further creations in the universe, secondarily reflected by the potency of the Omnipotent. Within the halo of the universe there is a transcendental planet known as &#346;vetadv&#299;pa, which is the abode of the K&#7779;&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Param&#257;tm&#257; feature of the Supreme Lord. Whenever there is trouble in the universe that cannot be solved by the administrative demigods, they approach Brahm&#257;j&#299; for a solution, and if it is not to be solved even by Brahm&#257;j&#299;, then Brahm&#257;j&#299; consults and prays to the K&#7779;&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u for an incarnation and solution to the problems. Such a problem arose when Ka&#7745;sa and others were ruling over the earth and the earth became too much overburdened by the misdeeds of the <span class="Italic">asuras.</span> Brahm&#257;j&#299;, along with other demigods, prayed at the shore of the K&#7779;&#299;rodaka Ocean, and they were advised of the descent of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as the son of Vasudeva and Devak&#299;. So some people say that the Lord appeared because of the prayers of Brahm&#257;j&#299;.</div>

<div class="Translation">And yet others say that You appeared to rejuvenate the devotional service of hearing, remembering, worshiping and so on in order that the conditioned souls suffering from material pangs might take advantage and gain liberation.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the Lord asserts that He appears in every millennium just to reestablish the way of religion. The way of religion is made by the Supreme Lord. No one can manufacture a new path of religion, as is the fashion for certain ambitious persons. The factual way of religion is to accept the Lord as the supreme authority and thus render service unto Him in spontaneous love. A living being cannot help but render service because he is constitutionally made for that purpose. The only function of the living being is to render service to the Lord. The Lord is great, and living beings are subordinate to Him. Therefore, the duty of the living being is just to serve Him only. Unfortunately the illusioned living beings, out of misunderstanding only, become servants of the senses by material desire. This desire is called <span class="Italic">avidy&#257;,</span> or nescience. And out of such desire the living being makes different plans for material enjoyment centered about a perverted sex life. He therefore becomes entangled in the chain of birth and death by transmigrating into different bodies on different planets under the direction of the Supreme Lord. Unless, therefore, one is beyond the boundary of this nescience, one cannot get free from the threefold miseries of material life. That is the law of nature.</div>
<div class="Purport">The Lord, however, out of His causeless mercy, because He is more merciful to the suffering living beings than they can expect, appears before them and renovates the principles of devotional service comprised of hearing, chanting, remembering, serving, worshiping, praying, cooperating and surrendering unto Him. Adoption of all the above-mentioned items, or any one of them, can help a conditioned soul get out of the tangle of nescience and thus become liberated from all material sufferings created by the living being illusioned by the external energy. This particular type of mercy is bestowed upon the living being by the Lord in the form of Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Supreme Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a cannot be seen by our present conditional vision. In order to see Him, one has to change his present vision by developing a different condition of life full of spontaneous love of Godhead. When &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was personally present on the face of the globe, not everyone could see Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Materialists like R&#257;va&#7751;a, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, Ka&#7745;sa, Jar&#257;sandha and &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la, were highly qualified personalities by acquisition of material assets, but they were unable to appreciate the presence of the Lord. Therefore, even though the Lord may be present before our eyes, it is not possible to see Him unless we have the necessary vision. This necessary qualification is developed by the process of devotional service only, beginning with hearing about the Lord from the right sources. The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> is one of the popular literatures which are generally heard, chanted, repeated, etc., by the people in general, but in spite of such hearing, etc., sometimes it is experienced that the performer of such devotional service does not see the Lord eye to eye. The reason is that the first item, <span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;a,</span> is very important. If hearing is from the right sources, it acts very quickly. Generally people hear from unauthorized persons. Such unauthorized persons may be very learned by academic qualifications, but because they do not follow the principles of devotional service, hearing from them becomes a sheer waste of time. Sometimes the texts are interpreted fashionably to suit their own purposes. Therefore, first one should select a competent and bona fide speaker and then hear from him. When the hearing process is perfect and complete, the other processes become automatically perfect in their own way.</div>
<div class="Purport">There are different transcendental activities of the Lord, and each and every one of them is competent to bestow the desired result, provided the hearing process is perfect. In the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> the activities of the Lord begin from His dealings with the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas. There are many other pastimes of the Lord in connection with His dealings with the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> and others. And in the Tenth Canto the sublime dealings with His conjugal associates, the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s,</span> as well as with His married wives at Dv&#257;rak&#257; are mentioned. Since the Lord is absolute, there is no difference in the transcendental nature of each and every dealing of the Lord. But sometimes people, in an unauthorized hearing process, take more interest in hearing about His dealings with the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s.</span> Such an inclination indicates the lusty feelings of the hearer, so a bona fide speaker of the dealings of the Lord never indulges in such hearings. One must hear about the Lord from the very beginning, as in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> or any other scriptures, and that will help the hearer attain perfection by progressive development. One should not, therefore, consider that His dealings with the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas are less important than His dealings with the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s.</span> We must always remember that the Lord is always transcendental to all mundane attachment. In all the above-mentioned dealings of the Lord, He is the hero in all circumstances, and hearing about Him or about His devotees or combatants is conducive to spiritual life. It is said that the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as,</span> etc., are all made to revive our lost relation with Him. Hearing of all these scriptures is essential.</div>

<div class="Translation">O my Lord, You have executed all duties Yourself. Are you leaving us today, though we are completely dependent on Your mercy and have no one else to protect us, now when all kings are at enmity with us?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas are most fortunate because with all good luck they were entirely dependent on the mercy of the Lord. In the material world, to be dependent on the mercy of someone else is the utmost sign of misfortune, but in the case of our transcendental relation with the Lord, it is the most fortunate case when we can live completely dependent on Him. The material disease is due to thinking of becoming independent of everything. But the cruel material nature does not allow us to become independent. The false attempt to become independent of the stringent laws of nature is known as material advancement of experimental knowledge. The whole material world is moving on this false attempt of becoming independent of the laws of nature. Beginning from R&#257;va&#7751;a, who wanted to prepare a direct staircase to the planets of heaven, down to the present age, they are trying to overcome the laws of nature. They are trying now to approach distant planetary systems by electronic mechanical power. But the highest goal of human civilization is to work hard under the guidance of the Lord and become completely dependent on Him. The highest achievement of perfect civilization is to work with valor but at the same time depend completely on the Lord. The P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas were the ideal executors of this standard of civilization. Undoubtedly they were completely dependent on the good will of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, but they were not idle parasites of the Lord. They were all highly qualified both by personal character and by physical activities. Still they always looked for the mercy of the Lord because they knew that every living being is dependent by constitutional position. The perfection of life is, therefore, to become dependent on the will of the Lord, instead of becoming falsely independent in the material world. Those who try to become falsely independent of the Lord are called <span class="Italic">an&#257;tha,</span> or without any guardian, whereas those who are completely dependent on the will of the Lord are called <span class="Italic">san&#257;tha,</span> or those having someone to protect them. Therefore we must try to be <span class="Italic">san&#257;tha</span> so that we can always be protected from the unfavorable condition of material existence. By the deluding power of the external material nature we forget that the material condition of life is the most undesirable perplexity. The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> therefore directs us (7.19) that after many, many births one fortunate person becomes aware of the fact that V&#257;sudeva is all in all and that the best way of leading one's life is to surrender unto Him completely. That is the sign of a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;.</span> All the members of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ava family were <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;s</span> in household life. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira was the head of these <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;s,</span> and Queen Kunt&#299;dev&#299; was the mother. The lessons of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and all the <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as,</span> specifically the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata Pur&#257;&#7751;a,</span> are therefore inevitably connected with the history of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ava <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;s.</span> For them, separation from the Lord was just like the separation of a fish from water. &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; Kunt&#299;dev&#299;, therefore, felt such separation like a thunderbolt, and the whole prayer of the Queen is to try to persuade the Lord to stay with them. After the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra, although the inimical kings were killed, their sons and grandsons were still there to deal with the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas. It is not only the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas who were put into the condition of enmity, but all of us are always in such a condition, and the best way of living is to become completely dependent on the will of the Lord and thereby overcome all difficulties of material existence.</div>

And this is all due to Your glancing over them.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Human prosperity flourishes by natural gifts and not by gigantic industrial enterprises. The gigantic industrial enterprises are products of a godless civilization, and they cause the destruction of the noble aims of human life. The more we go on increasing such troublesome industries to squeeze out the vital energy of the human being, the more there will be unrest and dissatisfaction of the people in general, although a few only can live lavishly by exploitation. The natural gifts such as grains and vegetables, fruits, rivers, the hills of jewels and minerals, and the seas full of pearls are supplied by the order of the Supreme, and as He desires, material nature produces them in abundance or restricts them at times. The natural law is that the human being may take advantage of these godly gifts by nature and satisfactorily flourish on them without being captivated by the exploitative motive of lording it over material nature. The more we attempt to exploit material nature according to our whims of enjoyment, the more we shall become entrapped by the reaction of such exploitative attempts. If we have sufficient grains, fruits, vegetables and herbs, then what is the necessity of running a slaughterhouse and killing poor animals? A man need not kill an animal if he has sufficient grains and vegetables to eat. The flow of river waters fertilizes the fields, and there is more than what we need. Minerals are produced in the hills, and the jewels in the ocean. If the human civilization has sufficient grains, minerals, jewels, water, milk, etc., then why should it hanker after terrible industrial enterprises at the cost of the labor of some unfortunate men? But all these natural gifts are dependent on the mercy of the Lord. What we need, therefore, is to be obedient to the laws of the Lord and achieve the perfection of human life by devotional service. The indications by Kunt&#299;dev&#299; are just to the point. She desires that God's mercy be bestowed upon them so that natural prosperity be maintained by His grace.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">A pure devotee of the Lord is ashamed to ask anything in self-interest from the Lord. But the householders are sometimes obliged to ask favors from the Lord, being bound by the tie of family affection. &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; Kunt&#299;dev&#299; was conscious of this fact, and therefore she prayed to the Lord to cut off the affectionate tie from her own kinsmen, the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas and the V&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;is. The P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas are her own sons, and the V&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;is are the members of her paternal family. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was equally related to both the families. Both the families required the Lord's help because both were dependent devotees of the Lord. &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; Kunt&#299;dev&#299; wished &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a to remain with her sons the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, but by His doing so her paternal house would be bereft of the benefit. All these partialities troubled the mind of Kunt&#299;, and therefore she desired to cut off the affectionate tie.</div>
<div class="Purport">A pure devotee cuts off the limited ties of affection for his family and widens his activities of devotional service for all forgotten souls. The typical example is the band of six Gosv&#257;m&#299;s, who followed the path of Lord Caitanya. All of them belonged to the most enlightened and cultured rich families of the higher castes, but for the benefit of the mass of population they left their comfortable homes and became mendicants. To cut off all family affection means to broaden the field of activities. Without doing this, no one can be qualified as a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> a king, a public leader or a devotee of the Lord. The Personality of Godhead, as an ideal king, showed this by example. &#346;r&#299; R&#257;macandra cut off the tie of affection for His beloved wife to manifest the qualities of an ideal king.</div>
<div class="Purport">Such personalities as a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> a devotee, a king or a public leader must be very broadminded in discharging their respective duties. &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; Kunt&#299;dev&#299; was conscious of this fact, and being weak she prayed to be free from such bondage of family affection. The Lord is addressed as the Lord of the universe, or the Lord of the universal mind, indicating His all-powerful ability to cut the hard knot of family affection. Therefore, it is sometimes experienced that the Lord, out of His special affinity towards a weak devotee, breaks the family affection by force of circumstances arranged by His all-powerful energy. By doing so He causes the devotee to become completely dependent on Him and thus clears the path for his going back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation">O Lord of Madhu, as the Ganges forever flows to the sea without hindrance, let my attraction be constantly drawn unto You without being diverted to anyone else.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Perfection of pure devotional service is attained when all attention is diverted towards the transcendental loving service of the Lord. To cut off the tie of all other affections does not mean complete negation of the finer elements, like affection for someone else. This is not possible. A living being, whoever he may be, must have this feeling of affection for others because this is a symptom of life. The symptoms of life, such as desire, anger, hankerings, feelings of attraction, etc., cannot be annihilated. Only the objective has to be changed. Desire cannot be negated, but in devotional service the desire is changed only for the service of the Lord in place of desire for sense gratification. The so-called affection for family, society, country, etc., consists of different phases of sense gratification. When this desire is changed for the satisfaction of the Lord, it is called devotional service.</div>
<div class="Purport">In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> we can see that Arjuna desired not to fight with his brothers and relations just to satisfy his own personal desires. But when he heard the message of the Lord, <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> he changed his decision and served the Lord. And for his doing so, he became a famous devotee of the Lord, for it is declared in all the scriptures that Arjuna attained spiritual perfection by devotional service to the Lord in friendship. The fighting was there, the friendship was there, Arjuna was there, and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was there, but Arjuna became a different person by devotional service. Therefore, the prayers of Kunt&#299; also indicate the same categorical changes in activities. &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; Kunt&#299; wanted to serve the Lord without diversion, and that was her prayer. This unalloyed devotion is the ultimate goal of life. Our attention is usually diverted to the service of something which is nongodly or not in the program of the Lord. When the program is changed into the service of the Lord, that is to say when the senses are purified in relation with the service of the Lord, it is called pure unalloyed devotional service. &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; Kunt&#299;dev&#299; wanted that perfection and prayed for it from the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purport">Her affection for the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas and the V&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;is is not out of the range of devotional service because the service of the Lord and the service of the devotees are identical. Sometimes service to the devotee is more valuable than service to the Lord. But here the affection of Kunt&#299;dev&#299; for the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas and the V&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;is was due to family relation. This tie of affection in terms of material relation is the relation of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> because the relations of the body or the mind are due to the influence of the external energy. Relations of the soul, established in relation with the Supreme Soul, are factual relations. When Kunt&#299;dev&#299; wanted to cut off the family relation, she meant to cut off the relation of the skin. The skin relation is the cause of material bondage, but the relation of the soul is the cause of freedom. This relation of the soul to the soul can be established by the via medium of the relation with the Supersoul. Seeing in the darkness is not seeing. But seeing by the light of the sun means to see the sun and everything else which was unseen in the darkness. That is the way of devotional service.</div>

It is said in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, &#256;di-parva</span></B> (20) that 640,000,000 men were killed in the eighteen days of the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra, and some hundreds of thousands were missing. Practically this was the greatest battle in the world within five thousand years.</div>
<div class="Purport">This mass killing simply to enthrone Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira was too mortifying, so he tried to be convinced with evidences from histories by great sages like Vy&#257;sa and the Lord Himself that the fight was just because the cause was just. But Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira would not be satisfied, even though he was instructed by the greatest personalities of the time. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is designated herein as the performer of superhuman actions, but in this particular instance neither He nor Vy&#257;sa could convince King Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira. Does it mean that He failed to be a superhuman actor? No, certainly not. The interpretation is that the Lord as <span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;vara,</span> or the Supersoul in the hearts of both King Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira and Vy&#257;sa, performed still more superhuman action because the Lord desired it. As Supersoul of King Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, He did not allow the King to be convinced by the words of Vy&#257;sa and others, including Himself, because He desired that the King hear instructions from the dying Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva, who was another great devotee of the Lord. The Lord wanted that at the last stage of his material existence the great warrior Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva see Him personally and see his beloved grandchildren, King Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, etc., now situated on the throne, and thus pass away very peacefully. Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva was not at all satisfied to fight against the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, who were his beloved fatherless grandchildren. But the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> are also very stern people, and therefore he was obliged to take the side of Duryodhana because he was maintained at the expense of Duryodhana. Besides this, the Lord also desired that King Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira be pacified by the words of Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva so that the world could see that Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva excelled all in knowledge, including the Lord Himself.</div>

<div class="First">King Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, though he was not expected to become aggrieved like a common man, became deluded by worldly affection by the will of the Lord (just as Arjuna was apparently deluded). A man who sees knows well that the living entity is neither the body nor the mind, but is transcendental to the material conception of life. The common man thinks of violence and nonviolence in terms of the body, but that is a kind of delusion. Everyone is duty-bound according to one's occupational duties. A <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> is bound to fight for the right cause, regardless of the opposite party. In such discharge of duty, one should not be disturbed by annihilation of the material body, which is only an external dress of the living soul. All this was perfectly known to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, but by the will of the Lord he became just like a common man because there was another great idea behind this delusion: the King would be instructed by Bh&#299;&#7779;ma as Arjuna was instructed by the Lord Himself.</div>

<div class="First">The <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hamedh&#299;s</span> are those whose only business is to perform welfare work for the sake of material prosperity. Such material prosperity is sometimes hampered by sinful activities, for the materialist is sure to commit sins, even unintentionally, in the course of discharging material duties. To get relief from such sinful reactions, the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> prescribe several kinds of sacrifices. It is said in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> that by performing the <I>a&#347;vamedha yaj&ntilde;a</I> (horse sacrifice) one can get relief from even <span class="Italic">brahma-haty&#257;</span> (killing of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span>).</div>
<div class="Purport">Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira Mah&#257;r&#257;ja performed this <I>a&#347;vamedha yaj&ntilde;a,</I> but he thinks that even by performing such <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;as</span> it is not possible to get relief from the great sins committed. In war either the husband or the brother or even the father or sons go to fight. And when they are killed, a fresh enmity is created, and thus a chain of actions and reactions increases which is not possible to be counteracted even by thousands of <I>a&#347;vamedha yaj&ntilde;as.</I></div>
<div class="Purport">The way of work (<span class="Italic">karma</span>) is like that. It creates one action and another reaction simultaneously and thus increases the chain of material activities, binding the performer in material bondage. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (Bg. <a href="index0526.html?g=3228">9.27</a>-28) the remedy is suggested that such actions and reactions of the path of work can be checked only when work is done on behalf of the Supreme Lord. The Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra was actually fought by the will of the Supreme Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, as it is evident from His version, and only by His will was Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira placed on the throne of Hastin&#257;pura. Therefore, factually no sin whatsoever touched the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, who were only the order carriers of the Lord.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"><span class="Italic">Parvata Muni:</span> is considered to be one of the oldest sages. He is almost always a constant companion of N&#257;rada Muni. They are also spacemen competent to travel in the air without the help of any material vehicle. Parvata Muni is also a <span class="Italic">devar&#7779;i,</span> or a great sage amongst the demigods, like N&#257;rada. He was present along with N&#257;rada at the sacrificial ceremony of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Janamejaya, son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it. In this sacrifice all the snakes of the world were to be killed. Parvata Muni and N&#257;rada Muni are called Gandharvas also because they can travel in the air singing the glories of the Lord. Since they can travel in the air, they observed Draupad&#299;'s <span class="Italic">svaya&#7745;vara</span> ceremony (selecting of her own husband) from the air. Like N&#257;rada Muni, Parvata Muni also used to visit the royal assembly in the heaven of King Indra. As a Gandharva, sometimes he visited the royal assembly of Kuvera, one of the important demigods. Both N&#257;rada and Parvata were once in trouble with the daughter of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja S&#7771;&ntilde;jaya. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja S&#7771;&ntilde;jaya got the benediction of a son by Parvata Muni.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">N&#257;rada Muni:</span> is inevitably associated with the narrations of the <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as.</span> He is described in the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> In his previous life he was the son of a maidservant, but by good association with pure devotees he became enlightened in devotional service, and in the next life he became a perfect man comparable with himself only. In the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> his name is mentioned in many places. He is the principle <span class="Italic">devar&#7779;i,</span> or the chief sage amongst the demigods. He is the son and disciple of Brahm&#257;j&#299;, and from him the disciplic succession in the line of Brahm&#257; has been spread. He initiated Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and many celebrated devotees of the Lord. He initiated even Vy&#257;sadeva, the author of the Vedic literatures, and from Vy&#257;sadeva, Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya was initiated, and thus the Madhva-samprad&#257;ya, in which the Gau&#7693;&#299;ya-samprad&#257;ya is also included, has spread all over the universe. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu belonged to this Madhva-samprad&#257;ya; therefore, Brahm&#257;j&#299;, N&#257;rada, Vy&#257;sa, down to Madhva, Caitanya and the Gosv&#257;m&#299;s all belonged to the same line of disciplic succession. N&#257;radaj&#299; has instructed many kings from time immemorial. In the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> we can see that he instructed Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja while he was in the womb of his mother, and he instructed Vasudeva, father of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, as well as Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Dhaumya:</span> A great sage who practiced severe penances at Utkocaka T&#299;rtha and was appointed royal priest of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ava kings. He acted as the priest in many religious functions of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas (<span class="Italic">sa&#7745;sk&#257;ra</span>), and also each of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas was attended by him at the betrothal of Draupad&#299;. He was present even during the exile of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas and used to advise them in circumstances when they were perplexed. He instructed them how to live incognito for one year, and his instructions were strictly followed by the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas during that time. His name is mentioned also when the general funeral ceremony was performed after the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra. In the <span class="Italic">Anu&#7779;&#257;sana-parva</span> of <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span></B> (127.15-16), he gave religious instructions very elaborately to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira. He was actually the right type of priest of a householder, for he could guide the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas on the right path of religion. A priest is meant for guiding the householder progressively in the right path of <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama-dharma,</span> or the occupational duty of a particular caste. There is practically no difference between the family priest and the spiritual master. The sages, saints and <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> were especially meant for such functions.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">B&#257;dar&#257;ya&#7751;a</span> (<span class="Italic">Vy&#257;sadeva</span>): He is known as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-dvaip&#257;yana, Dvaip&#257;yana, Satyavat&#299;-suta, P&#257;r&#257;&#347;arya, Par&#257;&#347;ar&#257;tmaja, B&#257;dar&#257;ya&#7751;a, Vedavy&#257;sa, etc. He was the son of Mah&#257;muni Par&#257;&#347;ara in the womb of Satyavat&#299; prior to her betrothal with Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#346;antanu, the father of the great general Grandfather Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva. He is a powerful incarnation of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, and he broadcasts the Vedic wisdom to the world. As such, Vy&#257;sadeva is offered respects before one chants the Vedic literature, especially the <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as.</span> &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was his son, and <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is</span> like Vai&#347;amp&#257;yana were his disciples for different branches of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> He is the author of the great epic <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> and the great transcendental literature <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> The <span class="Italic">Brahma-s&#363;tras</span>-the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tras,</span> or <span class="Italic">B&#257;dar&#257;ya&#7751;a-s&#363;tras</span>-were compiled by him. Amongst sages he is the most respected author by dint of severe penances. When he wanted to record the great epic <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> for the welfare of all people in the age of Kali, he was feeling the necessity of a powerful writer who could take up his dictation. By the order of Brahm&#257;j&#299;, &#346;r&#299; Ga&#7751;e&#347;aj&#299; took up the charge of noting down the dictation on the condition that Vy&#257;sadeva would not stop dictation for a moment. The <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> was thus compiled by the joint endeavor of Vy&#257;sa and Ga&#7751;e&#347;a.</div>
<div class="Purport">By the order of his mother, Satyavat&#299;, who was later married to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#346;antanu, and by the request of Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva, the eldest son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#346;antanu by his first wife, the Ganges, he begot three brilliant sons, whose names are Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra, P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u and Vidura. The <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> was compiled by Vy&#257;sadeva after the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra and after the death of all the heroes of <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata.</span> It was first spoken in the royal assembly of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Janamejaya, the son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">B&#7771;hada&#347;va:</span> An ancient sage who used to meet Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira now and then. First of all he met Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira at K&#257;myavana. This sage narrated the history of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Nala. There is another B&#7771;hada&#347;va, who is the son of the Ik&#7779;v&#257;ku dynasty (<span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, Vana-parva</span></B> 209.4-5)</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Bharadv&#257;ja:</span> He is one of the seven great <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is</span> and was present at the time of the birth ceremony of Arjuna. The powerful <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;i</span> sometimes undertook severe penances on the shore of the Ganges, and his <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama</span> is still celebrated at Pray&#257;gadh&#257;ma. It is learned that this <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;i,</span> while taking bath in the Ganges, happened to meet Gh&#7771;tac&#299;, one of the beautiful society girls of heaven, and thus he discharged semen, which was kept and preserved in an earthen pot and from which Dro&#7751;a was born. So Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya is the son of Bharadv&#257;ja Muni. Others say that Bharadv&#257;ja the father of Dro&#7751;a is a different person from Mahar&#7779;i Bharadv&#257;ja. He was a great devotee of Brahm&#257;. Once he approached Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya and requested him to stop the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Para&#347;ur&#257;ma,</span> or <span class="Italic">Re&#7751;uk&#257;suta:</span> He is the son of Mahar&#7779;i Jamadagni and &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; Re&#7751;uk&#257;. Thus he is also known as Re&#7751;uk&#257;suta. He is one of the powerful incarnations of God, and he killed the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> community as a whole twenty-one times. With the blood of the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> he pleased the souls of his forefathers. Later on he underwent severe penances at the Mahendra Parvata. After taking the whole earth from the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas,</span> he gave it in charity to Ka&#347;yapa Muni. Para&#347;ur&#257;ma instructed the <span class="Italic">Dhanur-veda,</span> or the science of fighting, to Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya because he happened to be a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> He was present during the coronation of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, and he celebrated the function along with other great <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">Para&#347;ur&#257;ma is so old that he met both R&#257;ma and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a at different times. He fought with R&#257;ma, but he accepted K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He also praised Arjuna when he saw him with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. When Bh&#299;&#7779;ma refused to marry Amb&#257;, who wanted him to become her husband, Amb&#257; met Para&#347;ur&#257;ma, and by her request only, he asked Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva to accept her as his wife. Bh&#299;&#7779;ma refused to obey his order, although he was one of the spiritual masters of Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva. Para&#347;ur&#257;ma fought with Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva when Bh&#299;&#7779;ma neglected his warning. Both of them fought very severely, and at last Para&#347;ur&#257;ma was pleased with Bh&#299;&#7779;ma and gave him the benediction of becoming the greatest fighter in the world.</div>

<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Italic">Trita:</span> One of the three sons of Praj&#257;pati Gautama. He was the third son, and his other two brothers were known as Ekat and Dvita. All the brothers were great sages and strict followers of the principles of religion. By dint of severe penances they were promoted to Brahmaloka (the planet where Brahm&#257;j&#299; lives). Once Trita Muni fell into a well. He was an organizing worker of many sacrifices, and as one of the great sages he also came to show respect to Bh&#299;&#7779;maj&#299; at his deathbed. He was one of the seven sages in the Varu&#7751;aloka. He hailed from the Western countries of the world. As such, most probably he belonged to the European countries. At that time the whole world was under one Vedic culture.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">G&#7771;tsamada:</span> One of the sages of the heavenly kingdom. He was a close friend of Indra, the King of heaven, and was as great as B&#7771;haspati. He used to visit the royal assembly of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, and he also visited the place where Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva breathed his last. Sometimes he explained the glories of Lord &#346;iva before Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira. He was the son of Vitahavya, and he resembled in features the body of Indra. Sometimes the enemies of Indra mistook him to be Indra and arrested him. He was a great scholar of the <span class="Italic">&#7770;g-veda,</span> and thus he was highly respected by the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> community. He lived a life of celibacy and was powerful in every respect.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Asita:</span> There was a king of the same name, but herein the Asita mentioned is the Asita Devala &#7770;&#7779;i, a great powerful sage of the time. He explained to his father 1,500,000 verses from the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata.</span> He was one of the members in the snake sacrifice of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Janamejaya. He was also present during the coronation ceremony of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira along with other great <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is.</span> He also gave Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira instructions while he was on the A&ntilde;jana Hill.

<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Kak&#7779;&#299;v&#257;n:</span> One of the sons of Gautama Muni and the father of the great sage Candakausika. He was one of the members of Parliament of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Atri:</span> Atri Muni was a great <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> sage and was one of the mental sons of Brahm&#257;j&#299;. Brahm&#257;j&#299; is so powerful that simply by thinking of a son he can have it. These sons are known as <span class="Italic">m&#257;nasa-putras.</span> Out of seven <span class="Italic">m&#257;nasa-putras</span> of Brahm&#257;j&#299; and out of the seven great <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> sages, Atri was one. In his family the great Pracet&#257;s were also born. Atri Muni had two <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> sons who became kings. King Arthama is one of them. He is counted as one of the twenty-one <span class="Italic">praj&#257;patis.</span> His wife's name was Anas&#363;y&#257;, and he helped Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it in his great sacrifices.</div>

He sometimes met Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. There are several other sages of the same name.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Sudar&#347;ana:</span> This wheel which is accepted by the Personality of Godhead (Vi&#7779;&#7751;u or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a) as His personal weapon is the most powerful weapon, greater than the <span class="Italic">brahm&#257;stras</span> or similar other disastrous weapons. In some of the Vedic literatures it is said that Agnideva, the fire-god, presented this weapon to Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, but factually this weapon is eternally carried by the Lord. Agnideva presented this weapon to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in the same way that Rukmi&#7751;&#299; was given by Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Rukma to the Lord. The Lord accepts such presentations from His devotees, even though such presentations are eternally His property. There is an elaborate description of this weapon in the <span class="Italic">&#256;di-parva</span> of the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata.</span> Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a used this weapon to kill &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la, a rival of the Lord. He also killed &#346;&#257;lva by this weapon, and sometimes He wanted His friend Arjuna to use it to kill his enemies (<span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, Vir&#257;&#7789;a-parva</span></B> 56.3).</div>

<div class="First"><span class="Italic">&#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;</span> (<span class="Italic">Brahmar&#257;ta</span>): The famous son and disciple of &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva, who taught him first the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> and then <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; recited 1,400,000 verses of the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> in the councils of the Gandharvas, Yak&#7779;as and R&#257;k&#7779;asas, and he recited <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> for the first time in the presence of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it. He thoroughly studied all the Vedic literatures from his great father. Thus he was a completely purified soul by dint of his extensive knowledge in the principles of religion. From <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, Sabh&#257;-parva</span></B> (4.11) it is understood that he was also present in the royal assembly of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira and at the fasting of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it. As a bona fide disciple of &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva, he inquired from his father very extensively about religious principles and spiritual values, and his great father also satisfied him by teaching him the <span class="Italic">yoga</span> system by which one can attain the spiritual kingdom, the difference between fruitive work and empiric knowledge, the ways and means of attaining spiritual realization, the four <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;ramas</span> (namely the student life, the householder's life, the retired life and the renounced life), the sublime position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the process of seeing Him eye to eye, the bona fide candidate for receiving knowledge, the consideration of the five elements, the unique position of intelligence, the consciousness of the material nature and the living entity, the symptoms of the self-realized soul, the working principles of the material body, the symptoms of the influential modes of nature, the tree of perpetual desire, and psychic activities. Sometimes he went to the sun planet with the permission of his father and N&#257;radaj&#299;. Descriptions of his travel in space are given in the <span class="Italic">&#346;&#257;nti-parva</span> of the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span></B> (332). At last he attained the transcendental realm. He is known by different names like Ara&#7751;eya, Aru&#7751;isuta, Vaiy&#257;saki and Vy&#257;s&#257;tmaja.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Ka&#347;yapa:</span> One of the <span class="Italic">praj&#257;patis,</span> the son of Mar&#299;ci and one of the sons-in-law of Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a. He is the father of the gigantic bird Garu&#7693;a, who was given elephants and tortoises as eatables. He married thirteen daughters of Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a, and their names are Aditi, Diti, Danu, K&#257;&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;, Ari&#7779;&#7789;&#257;, Suras&#257;, Il&#257;, Muni, Krodhava&#347;&#257;, T&#257;mr&#257;, Surabhi, Saram&#257; and Timi. He begot many children, both demigods and demons, by those wives. From his first wife, Aditi, all the twelve &#256;dityas were born; one of them is V&#257;mana, the incarnation of Godhead. This great sage, Ka&#347;yapa, was also present at the time of Arjuna's birth. He received a presentation of the whole world from Para&#347;ur&#257;ma, and later on he asked Para&#347;ur&#257;ma to go out of the world. His other name is Ari&#7779;&#7789;anemi. He lives on the northern side of the universe.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">&#256;&#7749;girasa:</span> He is the son of Mahar&#7779;i A&#7749;gir&#257; and is known as B&#7771;haspati, the priest of the demigods. It is said that Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya was his partial incarnation. &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya was the spiritual master of the demons, and B&#7771;haspati challenged him. His son is Kaca, and he delivered the fire weapon first to Bharadv&#257;ja Muni. He begot six sons (like the fire-god) by his wife Candram&#257;s&#299;, one of the reputed stars. He could travel in space, and therefore he could present himself even in the planets of Brahmaloka and Indraloka. He advised the King of heaven, Indra, about conquering the demons. Once he cursed Indra, who thus had to become a hog on the earth and was unwilling to return to heaven. Such is the power of the attraction of the illusory energy. Even a hog does not wish to part with its earthly possessions in exchange for a heavenly kingdom. He was the religious preceptor of the natives of different planets.</div>

Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva was one of the twelve great authorities in preaching this cult of devotional service, and therefore he could receive and welcome all the powerful sages assembled there at his deathbed from all parts of the universe. He was certainly unable at that time to welcome and receive them physically because he was neither at his home nor in a normal healthy condition. But he was quite fit by the activities of his sound mind, and therefore he could utter sweet words with hearty expressions, and all of them were well received. One can perform one's duty by physical work, by mind and by words.

Everyone has to bear the actions and reactions of time as long as one is within the conditions of the material world. Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira should not think that he had committed sins in his previous birth and is suffering the consequence. Even the most pious has to suffer the condition of material nature.

<div class="First">The bewilderment of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira over his past sinful acts and the resultant sufferings, etc., is completely negated by the great authority Bh&#299;&#7779;ma (one of the twelve authorized persons). Bh&#299;&#7779;ma wanted to impress upon Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira that since time immemorial no one, including such demigods as &#346;iva and Brahm&#257;, could ascertain the real plan of the Lord. So what can we understand about it? It is useless also to inquire about it. Even the exhaustive philosophical inquiries of sages cannot ascertain the plan of the Lord. The best policy is simply to abide by the orders of the Lord without argument. The sufferings of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas were never due to their past deeds. The Lord had to execute the plan of establishing the kingdom of virtue, and therefore His own devotees suffered temporarily in order to establish the conquest of virtue. Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva was certainly satisfied by seeing the triumph of virtue, and he was glad to see King Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira on the throne, although he himself fought against him. Even a great fighter like Bh&#299;&#7779;ma could not win the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra because the Lord wanted to show that vice cannot conquer virtue, regardless of who tries to execute it. Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva was a great devotee of the Lord, but he chose to fight against the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas by the will of the Lord because the Lord wanted to show that a fighter like Bh&#299;&#7779;ma cannot win on the wrong side.</div>

<div class="First">The Vedic system of acquiring knowledge is the deductive process. The Vedic knowledge is received perfectly by disciplic succession from authorities. Such knowledge is never dogmatic, as ill conceived by less intelligent persons. The mother is the authority to verify the identity of the father. She is the authority for such confidential knowledge. Therefore, authority is not dogmatic. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> this truth is confirmed in the Fourth Chapter (Bg. <a href="indexc8c3.html?g=1440">4.2</a>), and the perfect system of learning is to receive it from authority. The very same system is accepted universally as truth, but only the false arguer speaks against it. For example, modern spacecraft fly in the sky, and when scientists say that they travel to the other side of the moon, men believe these stories blindly because they have accepted the modern scientists as authorities. The authorities speak, and the people in general believe them. But in the case of Vedic truths, they have been taught not to believe. Even if they accept them they give a different interpretation. Each and every man wants a direct perception of Vedic knowledge, but foolishly they deny it. This means that the misguided man can believe one authority, the scientist, but will reject the authority of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> The result is that people have degenerated.</div>
<div class="Purport">Here is an authority speaking about &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as the original Personality of Godhead and the first N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. Even such an impersonalist as &#256;c&#257;rya &#346;a&#7749;kara has said in the beginning of his commentation on the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> that N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, the Personality of Godhead, is beyond the material creation. The universe is one of the material creations, but N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a is transcendental to such material paraphernalia.</div>
<div class="Purport">Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva is one of the twelve <span class="Italic">mah&#257;janas</span> who know the principles of transcendental knowledge. His confirmation of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's being the original Personality of Godhead is also corroborated by the impersonalist &#346;a&#7749;kara. All other <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> have also confirmed this statement, and thus there is no chance of not accepting Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as the original Personality of Godhead. Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva says that He is the first N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. This is also confirmed by Brahm&#257;j&#299; in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bh&#257;gavatam</span></B> (10.14.14). K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the first N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. In the spiritual world (Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha) there are unlimited numbers of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;as, who are all the same Personality of Godhead and are considered to be the plenary expansions of the original Personality of Godhead, &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The first form of the Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a first expands Himself as the form of Baladeva, and Baladeva expands in so many other forms, such as Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, V&#257;sudeva, N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, Puru&#7779;a, R&#257;ma and N&#7771;si&#7745;ha. All these expansions are one and the same <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-tattva,</span> and &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the original source of all the plenary expansions. He is therefore the direct Personality of Godhead. He is the creator of the material world, and He is the predominating Deity known as N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a in all the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets. Therefore, His movements amongst human beings is another sort of bewilderment. The Lord therefore says in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> that foolish persons consider Him to be one of the human beings without knowing the intricacies of His movements.</div>
<div class="Purport">The bewilderment regarding &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is due to the action of His twofold internal and external energies upon the third one, called marginal energy. The living entities are expansions of His marginal energy, and thus they are sometimes bewildered by the internal energy and sometimes by the external energy. By internal energetic bewilderment, &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a expands Himself into unlimited numbers of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;as and exchanges or accepts transcendental loving service from the living entities in the transcendental world. And by His external energetic expansions, He incarnates Himself in the material world amongst the men, animals or demigods to reestablish His forgotten relation with the living entities in different species of life. Great authorities like Bh&#299;&#7779;ma, however, escape His bewilderment by the mercy of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation">O King, Lord &#346;iva, N&#257;rada the sage amongst the demigods, and Kapila, the incarnation of Godhead, all know very confidentially about His glories through direct contact.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Pure devotees of the Lord are all <span class="Italic">bh&#257;vas,</span> or persons who know the glories of the Lord in different transcendental loving services. As the Lord has innumerable expansions of His plenary form, there are innumerable pure devotees of the Lord, who are engaged in the exchange of service of different humors. Ordinarily there are twelve great devotees of the Lord, namely Brahm&#257;, N&#257;rada, &#346;iva, Kum&#257;ra, Kapila, Manu, Prahl&#257;da, Bh&#299;&#7779;ma, Janaka, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and Yamar&#257;ja. Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva, although one of them, has mentioned only three important names of the twelve who know the glories of the Lord. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura, one of the great <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> in the modern age, explains that <span class="Italic">anubh&#257;va,</span> or the glory of the Lord, is first appreciated by the devotee in ecstasy manifesting the symptoms of perspiring, trembling, weeping, bodily eruptions, etc., which are further enhanced by steady understanding of the glories of the Lord. Such different understandings of <span class="Italic">bh&#257;vas</span> are exchanged between Ya&#347;od&#257; and the Lord (binding the Lord by ropes) and in the chariot driving by the Lord in the exchange of love with Arjuna. These glories of the Lord are exhibited in His being subordinated before His devotees, and that is another feature of the glories of the Lord. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; and the Kum&#257;ras, although situated in the transcendental position, became converted by another feature of <span class="Italic">bh&#257;va</span> and turned into pure devotees of the Lord. Tribulations imposed upon the devotees by the Lord constitute another exchange of transcendental <span class="Italic">bh&#257;va</span> between the Lord and the devotees. The Lord says "I put My devotee into difficulty, and thus the devotee becomes more purified in exchanging transcendental <span class="Italic">bh&#257;va</span> with Me." Placing the devotee into material troubles necessitates delivering him from the illusory material relations. The material relations are based on reciprocation of material enjoyment, which depends mainly on material resources. Therefore, when material resources are withdrawn by the Lord, the devotee is cent percent attracted toward the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Thus the Lord snatches the fallen soul from the mire of material existence. Tribulations offered by the Lord to His devotee are different from the tribulations resulting from vicious action. All these glories of the Lord are especially known to the great <span class="Italic">mah&#257;janas</span> like Brahm&#257;, &#346;iva, N&#257;rada, Kapila, Kum&#257;ra and Bh&#299;&#7779;ma, as mentioned above, and one is able to grasp it by their grace.</div>

He is Param&#257;tm&#257;, or the Supersoul, present in everyone as the supreme guidance, and therefore He is already the chariot driver and counsel of all living beings. When He, therefore, exhibits Himself as chariot driver of Arjuna, there is no change in His exalted position. It is the power of devotional service only that demonstrates Him as the chariot driver or the messenger. Since He has nothing to do with the material conception of life because He is absolute spiritual identity, there is for Him no superior or inferior action. Being the Absolute Personality of Godhead, He has no false ego, and so He does not identify Himself with anything different from Him. The material conception of ego is equibalanced in Him. He does not feel, therefore, inferior by becoming the chariot driver of His pure devotee. It is the glory of the pure devotee that only he can bring about service from the affectionate Lord.</div>

<div class="First">The Supreme Lord, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, although equal to everyone, is still more inclined to His unflinching devotee who is completely surrendered and knows no one else as his protector and master. Having unflinching faith in the Supreme Lord as one's protector, friend and master is the natural condition of eternal life. A living entity is so made by the will of the Almighty that he is most happy when placing himself in a condition of absolute dependence.</div>
<div class="Purport">The opposite tendency is the cause of falldown. The living entity has this tendency of falling down by dint of misidentifying himself as fully independent to lord it over the material world. The root cause of all troubles is there in false egotism. One must draw towards the Lord in all circumstances.</div>
<div class="Purport">The appearance of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a at the deathbed of Bh&#299;&#7779;maj&#299; is due to his being an unflinching devotee of the Lord. Arjuna had some bodily relation with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a because the Lord happened to be his maternal cousin. But Bh&#299;&#7779;ma had no such bodily relation. Therefore the cause of attraction was due to the intimate relation of the soul. Yet because the relation of the body is very pleasing and natural, the Lord is more pleased when He is addressed as the son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Nanda, the son of Ya&#347;od&#257;, the lover of R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;&#7751;&#299;. This affinity by bodily relation with the Lord is another feature of reciprocating loving service with the Lord. Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva is conscious of this sweetness of transcendental humor, and therefore he likes to address the Lord as Vijaya-Sakhe, P&#257;rtha-Sakhe, etc., exactly like Nanda-nandana or Ya&#347;od&#257;-nandana. The best way to establish our relation in transcendental sweetness is to approach Him through His recognized devotees. One should not try to establish the relation directly; there must be a via medium which is transparent and competent to lead us to the right path.</div>

<div class="Translation">The Personality of Godhead, who appears in the mind of the devotee by attentive devotion and meditation and by chanting of the holy name, releases the devotee from the bondage of fruitive activities at the time of his quitting the material body.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"><span class="Italic">Yoga</span> means concentration of the mind detached from all other subject matter. And actually such concentration is <span class="Italic">sam&#257;dhi,</span> or cent percent engagement in the service of the Lord. And one who concentrates his attention in that manner is called a <span class="Italic">yog&#299;.</span> Such a <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> devotee of the Lord engages himself twenty-four hours daily in the service of the Lord so that his whole attention is engrossed with the thoughts of the Lord in ninefold devotional service, namely hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, praying, becoming a voluntary servant, carrying out orders, establishing a friendly relationship, or offering all that one may possess, in the service of the Lord. By such practice of <span class="Italic">yoga,</span> or linking up in the service of the Lord, one is recognized by the Lord Himself, as it is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> concerning the highest perfectional stage of <span class="Italic">sam&#257;dhi.</span> The Lord calls such a rare devotee the best amongst all the <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> Such a perfect <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> is enabled by the divine grace of the Lord to concentrate his mind upon the Lord with a perfect sense of consciousness, and thus by chanting His holy name before quitting the body the <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> is at once transferred by the internal energy of the Lord to one of the eternal planets where there is no question of material life and its concomitant factors. In material existence a living being has to endure the material conditions of threefold miseries, life after life, according to his fruitive work. Such material life is produced by material desires only. Devotional service to the Lord does not kill the natural desires of the living being, but they are applied in the right cause of devotional service. This qualifies the desire to be transferred to the spiritual sky. General Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva is referring to a particular type of <span class="Italic">yoga</span> called <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> and he was fortunate enough to have the Lord directly in his presence before he quitted his material body.

<div class="Translation">May my Lord, who is four-handed and whose beautifully decorated lotus face, with eyes as red as the rising sun, is smiling, kindly await me at that moment when I quit this material body.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva knew well that Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the original N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. His worshipable Deity was four-handed N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, but he knew that four-handed N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a is a plenary expansion of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Indirectly he desired Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a to manifest Himself in His four-handed feature of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. A Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is always humble in his behavior. Although it was cent percent certain that Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva was approaching <span class="Italic">Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha-dh&#257;ma</span> just after leaving his material body, still as a humble Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava he desired to see the beautiful face of the Lord, for after quitting the present body he might not be in a position to see the Lord any more. A Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is not puffed up, although the Lord guarantees His pure devotee entrance into His abode. Here Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva says, "as long as I do not quit this body." This means that the great General would quit the body by his own will; he was not being forced by the laws of nature. He was so powerful that he could stay in his body as long as he desired. He got this benediction from his father. He desired that the Lord stay before him in His four-handed N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a feature so that he might concentrate upon Him and thus be in trance in that meditation. Then his mind might be sanctified with thinking of the Lord. Thus he did not mind wherever he might go. A pure devotee is never very anxious to go back to the kingdom of God. He entirely depends on the good will of the Lord. He is equally satisfied even if the Lord desires him to go to hell. The only desire that a pure devotee entertains is that he may always be in rapt attention with thinking of the lotus feet of the Lord, regardless. Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva wanted this much only: that his mind be absorbed in thinking of the Lord and that he pass away thus. That is the highest ambition of a pure devotee.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>

Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a inspired Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira to ask Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva in the presence of many great sages, indicating thereby that the Lord's devotee like Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva, although apparently living as a worldly man, is far superior to many great sages, even Vy&#257;sadeva. Another point is that Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva at that time was not only lying on a deathbed of arrows, but was greatly aggrieved because of that state. One should not have asked him any question at that time, but Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a wanted to prove that His pure devotees are always sound in body and mind by dint of spiritual enlightenment, and thus in any circumstances a devotee of the Lord is in perfect order to speak of the right way of life. Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira also preferred to solve his problematic questions by asking Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva rather than ask anyone else present there who was seemingly more learned than Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva. This is all due to the arrangement of the great wheel-carrier Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who establishes the glories of His devotee. The father likes to see the son become more famous than himself. The Lord declares very emphatically that worship of His devotee is more valuable than the worship of the Lord Himself.</div>

<div class="Translation">At Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira's inquiry, Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva first defined all the classifications of castes and orders of life in terms of the individual's qualifications. Then he systematically, in twofold divisions, described counteraction by detachment and interaction by attachment.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The conception of four castes and four orders of life, as planned by the Lord Himself (Bg. <a href="indexd112.html?g=1541">4.13</a>), is to accelerate transcendental qualities of the individual person so that he may gradually realize his spiritual identity and thus act accordingly to get free from material bondage, or conditional life. In almost all the <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> the subject matter is described in the same spirit, and so also in the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> it is more elaborately described by Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva in the <span class="Italic">&#346;&#257;nti-parva,</span> beginning from the sixtieth chapter.</div>
<div class="Purport">The <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> is prescribed for the civilized human being just to train him to successfully terminate human life. Self-realization is distinguished from the life of the lower animals engaged in eating, sleeping, fearing and mating. Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva advised for all human beings nine qualifications: (<B>1</B>) not to become angry, (<B>2</B>) not to lie, (<B>3</B>) to equally distribute wealth, (<B>4</B>) to forgive, (<B>5</B>) to beget children only by one's legitimate wife, (<B>6</B>) to be pure in mind and hygienic in body, (<B>7</B>) not to be inimical toward anyone, (<B>8</B>) to be simple, and (<B>9</B>) to support servants or subordinates. One cannot be called a civilized person without acquiring the above-mentioned preliminary qualities. Besides these, the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> (the intelligent men), the administrative men, the mercantile community and the laborer class must acquire special qualities in terms of occupational duties mentioned in all the Vedic scriptures. For the intelligent men, controlling the senses is the most essential qualification. It is the basis of morality. Sex indulgence even with a legitimate wife must also be controlled, and thereby family control will automatically follow. An intelligent man abuses his great qualifications if he does not follow the Vedic way of life. This means he must seriously make a study of the Vedic literatures, especially of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> and the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> For learning Vedic knowledge, one must approach a person who is cent percent engaged in devotional service. He must not do things which are forbidden in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras.</span> A person cannot be a teacher if he drinks or smokes. In the modern system of education the teacher's academic qualification is taken into consideration without evaluation of his moral life. Therefore, the result of education is misuse of high intelligence in so many ways.</div>
<div class="Purport">The <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya,</span> the member of the administrative class, is especially advised to give charity <span class="Italic">and not to accept charity in any circumstances.</span> Modern administrators raise subscriptions for some political functions, but never give charity to the citizens in any state function. It is just the reverse in the injunctions of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras.</span> The administrative class must be well versed in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras,</span> but must not take to the profession of teachers. <span class="Italic">The administrators should never pretend to become nonviolent</span> and thereby go to hell. When Arjuna wanted to become a nonviolent coward on the Battlefield of Kuruk&#7779;etra, he was severely chastised by Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The Lord degraded Arjuna at that time to the status of an uncivilized man for his avowed acceptance of the cult of nonviolence. The administrative class must be personally trained in military education. Cowards should not be elevated to the presidential throne by dint of numerical votes only. The monarchs were all chivalrous personalities, and therefore monarchy should be maintained provided the monarch is regularly trained in the occupational duties of a king. <span class="Italic">In fighting, the king or the president should never return home without being hurt by the enemy.</span> The so-called king of today never visits the warfield. He is very much expert in artificially encouraging the fighting strength in the hope of false national prestige. As soon as the administrative class is turned into a gang of mercantile and laborer men, the whole machinery of government becomes polluted.</div>
<div class="Purport">The <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas,</span> the members of the mercantile communities, are especially advised to protect the cows. Cow protection means increasing the milk productions, namely curd and butter. Agriculture and distribution of the foodstuff are the primary duties of the mercantile community backed by education in Vedic knowledge and trained to give in charity. As the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> were given charge of the protection of the citizens, <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas</span> were given the charge of the protection of animals. Animals are never meant to be killed. Killing of animals is a symptom of barbarian society. For a human being, agricultural produce, fruits and milk are sufficient and compatible foodstuffs. The human society should give more attention to animal protection. The productive energy of the laborer is misused when he is occupied by industrial enterprises. Industry of various types cannot produce the essential needs of man, namely rice, wheat, grains, milk, fruits and vegetables. The production of machines and machine tools increases the artificial living fashion of a class of vested interests and keeps thousands of men in starvation and unrest. This should not be the standard of civilization.</div>
<div class="Purport">The <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> class is less intelligent and should have no independence. They are meant for rendering sincere service to the three higher sections of the society. The <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> class can attain all comforts of life simply by rendering service to the higher classes. It is especially enjoined that a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> should never bank money. As soon as the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> accumulate wealth, it will be misused for sinful activities in wine, women and gambling. <span class="Italic">Wine, women and gambling indicate that the population is degraded to less than &#347;&#363;dra quality.</span> The higher castes should always look after the maintenance of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras,</span> and they should provide them with old and used garments. A <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> should not leave his master when the master is old and invalid, and the master should keep the servants satisfied in all respects. The <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> must first of all be satisfied by sumptuous food and clothing before any sacrifice is performed. In this age so many functions are held by spending millions, <span class="Italic">but the poor laborer is not sumptuously fed or given charity, clothing, etc.</span> The laborers are thus dissatisfied, and so they make agitation.</div>
<div class="Purport">The <span class="Italic">var&#7751;as</span> are, so to speak, classifications of different occupations, and <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> is gradual progress on the path of self-realization. Both are interrelated, and one is dependent on the other. The main purpose of <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> is to awaken knowledge and detachment. The <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299; &#257;&#347;rama</span> is the training ground for the prospective candidates. In this <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama</span> it is instructed that this material world is not actually the home of the living being. The conditioned souls under material bondage are prisoners of matter, and therefore self-realization is the ultimate aim of life. The whole system of <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> is a means to detachment. One who fails to assimilate this spirit of detachment is allowed to enter into family life with the same spirit of detachment. Therefore, one who attains detachment may at once adopt the fourth order, namely, renounced, and thus live on charity only, not to accumulate wealth, but just to keep body and soul together for ultimate realization. Household life is for <span class="Italic">one who is attached,</span> and the <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha</span> and <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> orders of life are for <span class="Italic">those who are detached</span> from material life. The <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;-&#257;&#347;rama</span> is especially meant for training both the attached and detached.</div>

<div class="Translation">He then explained, by divisions, acts of charity, the pragmatic activities of a king and activities for salvation. Then he described the duties of women and devotees, both briefly and extensively.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">To give charity is one of the householder's main functions, and he should be prepared to give in charity at least fifty percent of his hard-earned money. A <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;,</span> or student, should perform sacrifices, a householder should give charity, and a person in the retired life or in the renounced order should practice penances and austerities. Those are the general functions of all the <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;ramas,</span> or orders of life on the path of self-realization. In the <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> life the training is sufficiently imparted so that one may understand that the world as property belongs to the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead. No one, therefore, can claim to be the proprietor of anything in the world. Therefore, in the life of a householder, which is a sort of license for sex enjoyment, one must give in charity for the service of the Lord. Everyone's energy is generated or borrowed from the reservoir of energy of the Lord; therefore, the resultant actions of such energy must be given to the Lord in the shape of transcendental loving service for Him. As the rivers draw water from the sea through the clouds and again go down to the sea, similarly our energy is borrowed from the supreme source, the Lord's energy, and it must return to the Lord. That is the perfection of our energy. The Lord, therefore, in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index0526.html?g=3228">9.27</a>) says that whatever we do, whatever we undergo as penance, whatever we sacrifice, whatever we eat or whatever we give in charity must be offered to Him (the Lord). That is the way of utilizing our borrowed energy. When our energy is utilized in that way, our energy is purified from the contamination of material inebrieties, and thus we become fit for our original natural life of service to the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">R&#257;ja-dharma</span> is a great science, unlike modern diplomacy for political supremacy. The kings were trained systematically to become munificent and not merely be tax collectors. They were trained to perform different sacrifices only for the prosperity of the subjects. To lead the <span class="Italic">praj&#257;s</span> to the attainment of salvation was a great duty of the king. The father, the spiritual master and the king are not to become irresponsible in the matter of leading their subjects to the path of ultimate liberation from birth, death, diseases and old age. When these primary duties are properly discharged, there is no need of government of the people, by the people. In modern days the people in general occupy the administration by the strength of manipulated votes, but they are never trained in the primary duties of the king, and that is also not possible for everyone. Under the circumstances the untrained administrators play havoc to make the subjects happy in all respects. On the other hand, these untrained administrators gradually become rogues and thieves and increase the taxation to finance a top-heavy administration that is useless for all purposes. Actually the qualified <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are meant to give direction to the kings for proper administration in terms of the scriptures like the <span class="Italic">Manu-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">Dharma-&#347;&#257;stras</span> of Par&#257;&#347;ara. A typical king is the ideal of the people in general, and if the king is pious, religious, chivalrous and munificent, the citizens generally follow him. Such a king is not a lazy sensuous person living at the cost of the subjects, but alert always to kill thieves and dacoits. The pious kings were not merciful to dacoits and thieves in the name of nonsensical <span class="Italic">ahi&#7745;s&#257;</span> (nonviolence). The thieves and dacoits were punished in an exemplary way so that in the future no one would dare commit such nuisances in an organized form. Such thieves and dacoits were never meant for administration as they are now.</div>
<div class="Purport">The taxation law was simple. There was no force, no encroachment. The king had a right to take one fourth of the production made by the subject. The king had a right to claim a fourth of one's allotted wealth. One would never grudge parting with it because due to the pious king and religious harmony there was enough natural wealth, namely grains, fruits, flowers, silk, cotton, milk, jewels, minerals, etc., and therefore no one was materially unhappy. The citizens were rich in agriculture and animal husbandry, and therefore they had enough grains, fruits and milk without any artificial needs of soaps and toilets, cinemas and bars.</div>
<div class="Purport">The king had to see that the reserved energy of humanity was properly utilized. Human energy is meant not exactly for fulfilling animal propensities, but for self-realization. The whole government was specifically designed to fulfill this particular purpose. As such, the king had to select properly the cabinet ministers, but not on the strength of voting background. The ministers, the military commanders and even the ordinary soldiers were all selected by personal qualification, and the king had to supervise them properly before they were appointed to their respective posts. The king was especially vigilant to see that the <span class="Italic">tapasv&#299;s,</span> or persons who sacrificed everything for disseminating spiritual knowledge, were never disregarded. <span class="Italic">The king knew well that the Supreme Personality of Godhead never tolerates any insult to His unalloyed devotees.</span> Such <span class="Italic">tapasv&#299;s</span> were trusted leaders even of the rogues and thieves, who would never disobey the orders of <span class="Italic">tapasv&#299;s.</span> The king would give special protection to illiterates, the helpless and widows of the state. Defense measures were arranged previous to any attack by the enemies. The taxing process was easy, and it was not meant for squandering, but was for strengthening the reserve fund. The soldiers were recruited from all parts of the world, and they were trained for special duties.</div>
<div class="Purport">As far as salvation is concerned, one has to conquer the principles of lust, anger, unlawful desires, avarice and bewilderment. To get freedom from anger, one should learn how to forgive. To be free from unlawful desires one should not make plans. By spiritual culture one is able to conquer sleep. By tolerance only can one conquer desires and avarice. Disturbances from various diseases can be avoided by regulated diets. By self-control one can be free from false hopes, and money can be saved by avoiding undesirable association. By practice of <span class="Italic">yoga</span> one can control hunger, and worldliness can be avoided by culturing the knowledge of impermanence. Dizziness can be conquered by rising up, and false arguments can be conquered by factual ascertainment. Talkativeness can be avoided by gravity and silence, and by prowess one can avoid fearfulness. Perfect knowledge can be obtained by self-cultivation. One must be free from lust, avarice, anger, dreaming, etc., to actually attain the path of salvation.</div>
<div class="Purport">As far as the women class are concerned, they are accepted as a power of inspiration for men. As such, women are more powerful than men. Mighty Julius Caesar was controlled by a Cleopatra. Such powerful women are controlled by shyness. Therefore, shyness is important for women. Once this control valve is loosened, women can create havoc in society by adultery. Adultery means production of unwanted children known as <span class="Italic">var&#7751;a-sa&#7749;kara,</span> who disturb the world.</div>
<div class="Purport">The last item taught by Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva was the process of pleasing the Lord. We are all eternal servants of the Lord, and when we forget this essential part of our nature we are put into material conditions of life. The simple process of pleasing the Lord (for the householders especially) is to install the Deity of the Lord at home. By concentrating on the Deity, one may progressively go on with the daily routine work. Worshiping the Deity at home, serving the devotee, hearing the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> residing in a holy place and chanting the holy name of the Lord are all inexpensive items by which one can please the Lord. Thus the subject matter was explained by the grandfather to his grandchildren.</div>

<div class="Translation">While Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva was describing occupational duties, the sun's course ran into the northern hemisphere. This period is desired by mystics who die at their will.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The perfect <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> or mystics can leave the material body at their own sweet will at a suitable time and go to a suitable planet desired by them. In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexadaf.html?g=2947">8.24</a>) it is said that self-realized souls who have exactly identified themselves with the interest of the Supreme Lord can generally leave the material body during the time of the fire-god's effulgence and when the sun is in the northern horizon, and thus achieve the transcendental sky. In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> these times are considered auspicious for quitting the body, and they are taken advantage of by the expert mystics who have perfected the system. Perfection of <span class="Italic">yoga</span> means attainment of such supermental states as to be able to leave the material body as desired. <span class="Italic">Yog&#299;s</span> can also reach any planet within no time without a material vehicle. The <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> can reach the highest planetary system within a very short time, and this is impossible for the materialist. Even attempting to reach the highest planet will take millions of years at a speed of millions of miles per hour. This is a different science, and Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva knew well how to utilize it. He was just waiting for the suitable moment to quit his material body, and the golden opportunity arrived when he was instructing his noble grandsons, the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas. He thus prepared himself to quit his body before the exalted Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the pious P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas and the great sages headed by Bhagav&#257;n Vy&#257;sa, etc., all great souls.</div>

<div class="Purport">10: One who, at the time of death, fixes his life air between the eyebrows and in full devotion engages himself in remembering the Supreme Lord will certainly attain to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purport">11: Persons learned in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> who utter <span class="Italic">o&#7745;k&#257;ra</span> and who are great sages in the renounced order, enter into Brahman.

<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299; Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva attained the perfection of quitting his body at will and was fortunate enough to have Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the object of his attention, personally present at the time of death. He therefore fixed his open eyes upon Him. He wanted to see &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a for a long time out of his spontaneous love for Him. Because he was a pure devotee, he had very little to do with the detailed performance of yogic principles. Simple <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> is enough to bring about perfection.

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">By pure meditation, looking at Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, he at once was freed from all material inauspiciousness and was relieved of all bodily pains caused by the arrow wounds. Thus all the external activities of his senses at once stopped, and he prayed transcendentally to the controller of all living beings while quitting his material body.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The material body is a gift of the material energy, technically called illusion. Identification with the material body is due to forgetfulness of our eternal relationship with the Lord. For a pure devotee of the Lord like Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva, this illusion was at once removed as soon as the Lord arrived. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is like the sun, and the illusory, external material energy is like darkness. In the presence of the sun there is no possibility that darkness can stand. Therefore, just on the arrival of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, all material contamination was completely removed, and Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva was thus able to be transcendentally situated by stopping the activities of the impure senses in collaboration with matter. The soul is originally pure and so also the senses. By material contamination the senses assume the role of imperfection and impurity. By revival of contact with the Supreme Pure, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the senses again become freed from material contaminations. Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva attained all these transcendental conditions prior to his leaving the material body because of presence of the Lord. The Lord is the controller and benefactor of all living beings. That is the verdict of all <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> He is the supreme eternity and living entity amongst all the eternal living beings.<PW:Popup,3.875,2.01042,Popup><div class="Verse-in-purp">nityo nity&#257;n&#257;&#7745; cetana&#347; cetan&#257;n&#257;m<br>eko bah&#363;n&#257;&#7745; yo vidadh&#257;ti k&#257;m&#257;n<br>tam &#257;tma-stha&#7745; ye 'nupa&#347;yanti dh&#299;r&#257;s<br>te&#7779;&#257;&#7745; &#347;&#257;nti&#7717; &#347;&#257;&#347;vat&#299; netare&#7779;&#257;m</div></div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva said: Let me now invest my thinking, feeling and willing, which were so long engaged in different subjects and occupational duties, in the all-powerful Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. He is always self-satisfied, but sometimes, being the leader of the devotees, He enjoys transcendental pleasure by descending on the material world, although from Him only the material world is created.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Because Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva was a statesman, the head of the Kuru dynasty, a great general and a leader of <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas,</span> his mind was strewn over so many subjects, and his thinking, feeling and willing were engaged in different matters. Now, in order to achieve pure devotional service, he wanted to invest all powers of thinking, feeling and willing entirely in the Supreme Being, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. He is described herein as the leader of the devotees and all-powerful. Although Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the original Personality of Godhead, He Himself descends on earth to bestow upon His pure devotees the boon of devotional service. He descends sometimes as Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as He is, and sometimes as Lord Caitanya. Both are leaders of the pure devotees. Pure devotees of the Lord have no desire other than the service of the Lord, and therefore they are called <span class="Italic">s&#257;tvata.</span> The Lord is the chief amongst such <span class="Italic">s&#257;tvatas.</span> Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva, therefore, had no other desires. Unless one is purified from all sorts of material desires, the Lord does not become one's leader. Desires cannot be wiped out, but they have only to be purified. It is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> by the Lord Himself that He gives His instruction from within the heart of a pure devotee who is constantly engaged in the service of the Lord. Such instruction is given not for any material purpose but only for going back home, back to Godhead (Bg. <a href="index0c2e.html?g=3378">10.10</a>). For the ordinary man who wants to lord it over material nature, the Lord not only sanctions and becomes a witness of activities, but He never gives the nondevotee instructions for going back to Godhead. That is the difference in dealings by the Lord with different living beings, both the devotee and the nondevotee. He is leader of all the living beings, as the king of the state rules both the prisoners and the free citizens. But His dealings are different in terms of devotee and nondevotee. Nondevotees never care to take any instruction from the Lord, and therefore the Lord is silent in their case, although He witnesses all their activities and awards them the necessary results, good or bad. The devotees are above this material goodness and badness. They are progressive on the path of transcendence, and therefore they have no desire for anything material. The devotee also knows &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as the original N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a because Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, by His plenary portion, appears as the K&#257;ra&#7751;odaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the original source of all material creation. The Lord also desires the association of His pure devotees, and for them only the Lord descends on the earth and enlivens them. The Lord appears out of His own will. He is not forced by the conditions of material nature. He is therefore described here as the <span class="Italic">vibhu,</span> or the almighty, for He is never conditioned by the laws of material nature.</div>

<div class="Translation">&#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the intimate friend of Arjuna. He has appeared on this earth in His transcendental body, which resembles the bluish color of the tam&#257;la tree. His body attracts everyone in the three planetary systems [upper, middle and lower]. May His glittering yellow dress and His lotus face, covered with paintings of sandalwood pulp, be the object of my attraction, and may I not desire fruitive results.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">When &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a by His own internal pleasure appears on earth, He does so by the agency of His internal potency. The attractive features of His transcendental body are desired in all the three worlds, namely the upper, middle and lower planetary systems. Nowhere in the universe are there such beautiful bodily features as those of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Therefore His transcendental body has nothing to do with anything materially created. Arjuna is described here as the conqueror, and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is described as his intimate friend. Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva, on his bed of arrows after the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra, is remembering the particular dress of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a which He put on as the driver of Arjuna's chariot. While fighting was going on between Arjuna and Bh&#299;&#7779;ma, Bh&#299;&#7779;ma's attraction was drawn by the glittering dress of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and indirectly he admired his so-called enemy Arjuna for possessing the Lord as his friend. Arjuna was always a conqueror because the Lord was his friend. Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva takes this opportunity to address the Lord as <span class="Italic">vijaya-sakhe</span> (friend of Arjuna) because the Lord is pleased when He is addressed conjointly with His devotees, who are related with Him in different transcendental humors. While K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was the charioteer of Arjuna, sun rays glittered on the dress of the Lord, and the beautiful hue created by the reflection of such rays was never forgotten by Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva. As a great fighter he was relishing the relation of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in the chivalrous humor. Transcendental relation with the Lord in any one of the different <span class="Italic">rasas</span> (humors) is relishable by the respective devotees in the highest ecstasy. Less intelligent mundaners who want to make a show of being transcendentally related with the Lord artificially jump at once to the relation of conjugal love, imitating the damsels of Vrajadh&#257;ma. Such a cheap relation with the Lord exhibits only the base mentality of the mundaner because one who has relished conjugal humor with the Lord cannot be attached to worldly conjugal <span class="Italic">rasa,</span> which is condemned even by mundane ethics. The eternal relation of a particular soul with the Lord is evolved. A genuine relation of the living being with the Supreme Lord can take any form out of the five principal <span class="Italic">rasas,</span> and it does not make any difference in transcendental degree to the genuine devotee. Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva is a concrete example of this, and it should be carefully observed how the great general is transcendentally related with the Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">On the battlefield [where &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a attended Arjuna out of friendship], the flowing hair of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a turned ashen due to the dust raised by the hoofs of the horses. And because of His labor, beads of sweat wetted His face. All these decorations, intensified by the wounds dealt by my sharp arrows, were enjoyed by Him. Let my mind thus go unto &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Lord is the absolute form of eternity, bliss and knowledge. As such, transcendental loving service to the Lord in one of the five principal relations, namely <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;nta, d&#257;sya, sakhya, v&#257;tsalya</span> and <span class="Italic">m&#257;dhurya,</span> i.e., neutrality, servitorship, fraternity, filial affection and conjugal love, is graciously accepted by the Lord when offered to the Lord in genuine love and affection. &#346;r&#299; Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva is a great devotee of the Lord in the relation of servitorship. Thus his throwing of sharp arrows at the transcendental body of the Lord is as good as the worship of another devotee who throws soft roses upon Him.</div>
<div class="Purport">It appears that Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva is repenting the actions he committed against the person of the Lord. But factually the Lord's body was not at all pained, due to His transcendental existence. His body is not matter. Both He Himself and His body are complete spiritual identity. Spirit is never pierced, burnt, dried, moistened, etc. This is vividly explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> So also it is stated in the <span class="Italic">Skanda Pur&#257;&#7751;a.</span> It is said there that spirit is always uncontaminated and indestructible. It cannot be distressed, nor can it be dried up. When Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u in His incarnation appears before us, He seems to be like one of the conditioned souls, materially encaged, just to bewilder the <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> or the nonbelievers, who are always alert to kill the Lord, even from the very beginning of His appearance. Ka&#7745;sa wanted to kill K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and R&#257;va&#7751;a wanted to kill R&#257;ma, because foolishly they were unaware of the fact that the Lord is never killed, for the spirit is never annihilated.</div>
<div class="Purport">Therefore Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva's piercing of the body of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is a sort of bewildering problem for the nondevotee atheist, but those who are devotees, or liberated souls, are not bewildered.</div>
<div class="Purport">Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva appreciated the all-merciful attitude of the Lord because He did not leave Arjuna alone, although He was disturbed by the sharpened arrows of Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva, nor was He reluctant to come before Bh&#299;&#7779;ma's deathbed, even though He was ill-treated by him on the battlefield. Bh&#299;&#7779;ma's repentance and the Lord's merciful attitude are both unique in this picture.</div>
<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299; Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura, a great <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya</span> and devotee in the humor of conjugal love with the Lord, remarks very saliently in this regard. He says that the wounds created on the body of the Lord by the sharpened arrows of Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva were as pleasing to the Lord as the biting of a fiancee who bites the body of the Lord directed by a strong sense of sex desire. Such biting by the opposite sex is never taken as a sign of enmity, even if there is a wound on the body. Therefore, the fighting as an exchange of transcendental pleasure between the Lord and His pure devotee, &#346;r&#299; Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva, was not at all mundane. Besides that, since the Lord's body and the Lord are identical, there was no possibility of wounds in the absolute body. The apparent wounds caused by the sharpened arrows are misleading to the common man, but one who has a little absolute knowledge can understand the transcendental exchange in the chivalrous relation. The Lord was perfectly happy with the wounds caused by the sharpened arrows of Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva. The word <span class="Italic">vibhidyam&#257;na</span> is significant because the Lord's skin is not different from the Lord. Because our skin is different from our soul, in our case the word <span class="Italic">vibhidyam&#257;na,</span> or being bruised and cut, would have been quite suitable. Transcendental bliss is of different varieties, and the variety of activities in the mundane world is but a perverted reflection of transcendental bliss. Because everything in the mundane world is qualitatively mundane, it is full of inebrieties, whereas in the absolute realm, because everything is of the same absolute nature, there are varieties of enjoyment without inebriety. The Lord enjoyed the wounds created by His great devotee Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva, and because Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva is a devotee in the chivalrous relation, he fixes up his mind on K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in that wounded condition.</div>

<div class="Translation">In obedience to the command of His friend, Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a entered the arena of the Battlefield of Kuruk&#7779;etra between the soldiers of Arjuna and Duryodhana, and while there He shortened the life spans of the opposite party by His merciful glance. This was done simply by His looking at the enemy. Let my mind be fixed upon that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index63f2.html?g=177">1.21</a>-25) Arjuna ordered the infallible Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a to place his chariot between the phalanxes of the soldiers. He asked Him to stay there until he had finished observing the enemies he had to face in the battle. When the Lord was so asked, He at once did so, just like an order carrier. And the Lord pointed out all the important men on the opposite side, saying, "Here is Bh&#299;&#7779;ma, here is Dro&#7751;a," and so on. The Lord, being the supreme living being, is never the order supplier or order carrier of anyone, whoever he may be. But out of His causeless mercy and affection for His pure devotees, sometimes He carries out the order of the devotee like an awaiting servant. By executing the order of a devotee, the Lord becomes pleased, as a father is pleased to carry out the order of his small child. This is possible only out of pure transcendental love between the Lord and His devotees, and Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva was quite aware of this fact. He therefore addressed the Lord as the friend of Arjuna.</div>
<div class="Purport">The Lord diminished the duration of life of the opposite party by His merciful glance. It is said that all the fighters who assembled on the Battlefield of Kuruk&#7779;etra attained salvation by personally seeing the Lord at the time of death. Therefore, His diminishing the duration of life of Arjuna's enemy does not mean that He was partial to the cause of Arjuna. Factually He was merciful to the opposite party because they would not have attained salvation by dying at home in the ordinary course of life. Here was a chance to see the Lord at the time of death and thus attain salvation from material life. Therefore, the Lord is all good, and whatever He does is for everyone's good. Apparently it was for the victory of Arjuna, His intimate friend, but factually it was for the good of Arjuna's enemies. Such are the transcendental activities of the Lord, and whoever understands this also gets salvation after quitting this material body. The Lord does no wrong in any circumstance because He is absolute, all good at all times.</div>

<div class="Translation">When Arjuna was seemingly polluted by ignorance upon observing the soldiers and commanders before him on the battlefield, the Lord eradicated his ignorance by delivering transcendental knowledge. May His lotus feet always remain the object of my attraction.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The kings and the commanders were to stand in the front of the fighting soldiers. That was the system of actual fighting. The kings and commanders were not so-called presidents or ministers of defense as they are today. They would not stay home while the poor soldiers or mercenaries were fighting face to face. This may be the regulation of modern democracy, but when actual monarchy was prevailing, the monarchs were not cowards elected without consideration of qualification. As it was evident from the Battlefield of Kuruk&#7779;etra, all the executive heads of both parties, like Dro&#7751;a, Bh&#299;&#7779;ma, Arjuna and Duryodhana, were not sleeping; all of them were actual participants in the fighting, which was selected to be executed at a place away from the civil residential quarters. This means that the innocent citizens were immune from all effects of fighting between the rival royal parties. The citizens had no business in seeing what was going to happen during such fighting. They were to pay one fourth of their income to the ruler, whether he be Arjuna or Duryodhana. All the commanders of the parties on the Battlefield of Kuruk&#7779;etra were standing face to face, and Arjuna saw them with great compassion and lamented that he was to kill his kinsmen on the battlefield for the sake of the empire. He was not at all afraid of the giant military phalanx presented by Duryodhana, but as a merciful devotee of the Lord, renunciation of worldly things was natural for him, and thus he decided not to fight for worldly possessions. But this was due to a poor fund of knowledge, and therefore it is said here that his intelligence became polluted. His intelligence could not be polluted at any time because he was a devotee and constant companion of the Lord, as is clear in the Fourth Chapter of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> Apparently Arjuna's intelligence became polluted because otherwise there would not have been a chance to deliver the teachings of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> for the good of all polluted conditioned souls engaged in material bondage by the conception of the false material body. The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> was delivered to the conditioned souls of the world to deliver them from the wrong conception of identifying the body with the soul and to reestablish the soul's eternal relation with the Supreme Lord. <span class="Italic">&#256;tma-vidy&#257;,</span> or transcendental knowledge of Himself, was primarily spoken by the Lord for the benefit of all concerned in all parts of the universe.</div>

<div class="Translation">Fulfilling my desire and sacrificing His own promise, He got down from the chariot, took up its wheel, and ran towards me hurriedly, just as a lion goes to kill an elephant. He even dropped His outer garment on the way.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra was fought on military principles but at the same time in a sporting spirit, like a friend's fight with another friend. Duryodhana criticized Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva, alleging that he was reluctant to kill Arjuna because of paternal affection. A <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> cannot tolerate insults on the principle of fighting. Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva therefore promised that the next day he would kill all five P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas with special weapons made for the purpose. Duryodhana was satisfied, and he kept the arrows with him to be delivered the next day during the fight. By tricks Arjuna took the arrows from Duryodhana, and Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva could understand that this was the trick of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. So he took a vow that the next day K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a would have to take up weapons Himself, otherwise His friend Arjuna would die. In the next day's fighting Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva fought so violently that both Arjuna and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a were in trouble. Arjuna was almost defeated; the situation was so tense that he was about to be killed by Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva the very next moment. At that time Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a wanted to please His devotee, Bh&#299;&#7779;ma, by keeping Bh&#299;&#7779;ma's promise, which was more important than His own. Seemingly He broke His own promise. He promised before the beginning of the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra that He would remain without weapons and would not use His strength for either of the parties. But to protect Arjuna He got down from the chariot, took up the wheel of the chariot and hurriedly rushed at Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva in an angry mood, as a lion goes to kill an elephant. He dropped His covering cloth on the way, and out of great anger He did not know that He had dropped it. Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva at once gave up his weapons and stood to be killed by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, his beloved Lord. The fighting of the day was thus ended at that very moment, and Arjuna was saved. Of course there was no possibility of Arjuna's death because the Lord Himself was on the chariot, but because Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva wanted to see Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a take up some weapon to save His friend, the Lord created this situation, making Arjuna's death imminent. He stood before Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva to show him that his promise was fulfilled and that He had taken up the wheel.</div>

<div class="Translation">May He, Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Personality of Godhead, who awards salvation, be my ultimate destination. On the battlefield He charged me, as if angry because of the wounds dealt by my sharp arrows. His shield was scattered, and His body was smeared with blood due to the wounds.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The dealings of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva on the Battlefield of Kuruk&#7779;etra are interesting because the activities of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appeared to be partial to Arjuna and at enmity with Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva; but factually all this was especially meant to show special favor to Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva, a great devotee of the Lord. <span class="Italic">The astounding feature of such dealings is that a devotee can please the Lord by playing the part of an enemy.</span> The Lord, being absolute, can accept service from His pure devotee even in the garb of an enemy. The Supreme Lord cannot have any enemy, nor can a so-called enemy harm Him because He is <span class="Italic">ajita,</span> or unconquerable. But still He takes pleasure when His pure devotee beats Him like an enemy or rebukes Him from a superior position, although no one can be superior to the Lord. These are some of the transcendental reciprocatory dealings of the devotee with the Lord. And those who have no information of pure devotional service cannot penetrate into the mystery of such dealings. Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva played the part of a valiant warrior, and he purposely pierced the body of the Lord so that to the common eyes it appeared that the Lord was wounded, but factually all this was to bewilder the nondevotees. The all-spiritual body cannot be wounded, and a devotee cannot become the enemy of the Lord. Had it been so, Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva would not have desired to have the very same Lord as the ultimate destination of his life. Had Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva been an enemy of the Lord, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a could have annihilated him without even moving. There was no need to come before Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva with blood and wounds. But He did so because the warrior devotee wanted to see the transcendental beauty of the Lord decorated with wounds created by a pure devotee. This is the way of exchanging transcendental <span class="Italic">rasa,</span> or relations between the Lord and the servitor. By such dealings both the Lord and the devotee become glorified in their respective positions. The Lord was so angry that Arjuna checked Him when He was moving towards Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva, but in spite of Arjuna's checking, He proceeded towards Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva as a lover goes to a lover, without caring for hindrances. Apparently His determination was to kill Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva, but factually it was to please him as a great devotee of the Lord. The Lord is undoubtedly the deliverer of all conditioned souls. The impersonalists desire salvation from Him, and He always awards them according to their aspiration, but here Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva aspires to see the Lord in His personal feature. All pure devotees aspire for this.</div>

<div class="Translation">At the moment of death, let my ultimate attraction be to &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Personality of Godhead. I concentrate my mind upon the chariot driver of Arjuna who stood with a whip in His right hand and a bridle rope in His left, who was very careful to give protection to Arjuna's chariot by all means. Those who saw Him on the Battlefield of Kuruk&#7779;etra attained their original forms after death.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">A pure devotee of the Lord constantly sees the presence of the Lord within himself because of being transcendentally related by loving service. Such a pure devotee cannot forget the Lord for a moment. This is called trance. The mystic (<span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span>) tries to concentrate upon the Supersoul by controlling the senses from all other engagements, and thus he ultimately attains <span class="Italic">sam&#257;dhi.</span> A devotee more easily attains <span class="Italic">sam&#257;dhi,</span> or trance, by constantly remembering the Lord's personal feature along with His holy name, fame, pastimes, etc. Therefore, the concentration of the mystic <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> and that of the devotee are not on the same level. The concentration of the mystic is mechanical, whereas that of the pure devotee is natural in pure love and spontaneous affection. Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva was a pure devotee, and as a military marshal he constantly remembered the battlefield feature of the Lord as P&#257;rtha-s&#257;rathi, the chariot driver of Arjuna. Therefore, the Lord's pastime as P&#257;rtha-s&#257;rathi is also eternal. The pastimes of the Lord, beginning from His birth at the prison house of Ka&#7745;sa up to the <span class="Italic">mausala-l&#299;l&#257;</span> at the end, all move one after another in all the universes, just as the clock hand moves from one point to another. And in such pastimes His associates like the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas and Bh&#299;&#7779;ma are constant eternal companions. So Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva never forgot the beautiful feature of the Lord as P&#257;rtha-s&#257;rathi, which even Arjuna could not see. Arjuna was behind the beautiful P&#257;rtha-s&#257;rathi while Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva was just in front of the Lord. As far as the military feature of the Lord is concerned, Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva observed this with more relish than Arjuna.</div>
<div class="Purport">All the soldiers and persons on the Battlefield of Kuruk&#7779;etra attained their original spiritual form like the Lord after their death because by the causeless mercy of the Lord they were able to see Him face to face on that occasion. The conditioned souls rotating in the evolutionary cycle from the aquatics up to the form of Brahm&#257; are all in the form of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> or the form obtained by one's own actions and awarded by material nature. The material forms of the conditioned souls are all foreign dresses, and when the conditioned soul becomes liberated from the clutches of material energy, he attains his original form. The impersonalist wants to attain the impersonal Brahman effulgence of the Lord, but that is not at all congenial to the living sparks, parts and parcels of the Lord. Therefore, the impersonalists again fall down and get material forms, which are all false to the spirit soul. A spiritual form like the Lord's, either two-handed or four-handed, is attained by the devotees of the Lord either in the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;has or in the Goloka planet, according to the original nature of the soul. This form, which is cent percent spiritual, is the <span class="Italic">svar&#363;pa</span> of the living being, and all the living beings who participated on the Battlefield of Kuruk&#7779;etra, on both sides, attained their <span class="Italic">svar&#363;pa,</span> as confirmed by Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva. So Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was not merciful only to the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas; He was also merciful to the other parties because all of them attained the same result. Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva wanted the same facility also, and that was his prayer to the Lord, although his position as an associate of the Lord is assured in all circumstances. The conclusion is that whoever dies looking on the Personality of Godhead within or without attains his <span class="Italic">svar&#363;pa,</span> which is the highest perfection of life.</div>

<div class="First">By intense ecstasy in loving service, the damsels of Vrajabh&#363;mi attained qualitative oneness with the Lord by dancing with Him on an equal level, embracing Him in nuptial love, smiling at Him in joke, and looking at Him with a loving attitude.

By the grace of the Lord, Arjuna was fortunate enough to have the fraternal service of the Lord as chariot driver, but the Lord did not award Arjuna with equal strength. The <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s,</span> however, practically became one with the Lord by attainment of equal footing with the Lord. Bh&#299;&#7779;ma's aspiration to remember the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> is a prayer to have their mercy also at the last stage of his life. The Lord is satisfied more when His pure devotees are glorified, and therefore Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva has not only glorified the acts of Arjuna, his immediate object of attraction, but has also remembered the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s,</span> who were endowed with unrivalled opportunities by rendering loving service to the Lord. The <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span>' equality with the Lord should never be misunderstood to be like the <span class="Italic">s&#257;yujya</span> liberation of the impersonalist. The equality is one of perfect ecstasy where the differential conception is completely eradicated, for the interests of the lover and the beloved become identical.</div>

The defeated challenger would have to sacrifice his life, making a place for another king or ruler. So Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira also dispatched such challenging horses all over the world, and every ruling prince and king all over the world accepted Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira's leadership as the Emperor of the world. After this, all rulers of the world under the regime of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira were invited to participate in the great sacrificial ceremony of R&#257;jas&#363;ya. Such performances required hundreds of millions of dollars, and it was not an easy job for a petty king. Such a sacrificial ceremony, being too expensive and also difficult to perform under present circumstances, is now impossible in this age of Kali. Nor can anyone secure the required expert priesthood to take charge of the ceremony.</div>
<div class="Purport">So, after being invited, all the kings and great learned sages of the world assembled in the capital of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira. The learned society, including the great philosophers, religionists, physicians, scientists and all great sages, was invited. That is to say, the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> were the topmost leading men in society, and they were all invited to participate in the assembly. The <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> were unimportant elements in society, and they are not mentioned herein. Due to the change of social activities in the modern age, the importance of men has also changed in terms of occupational positions.</div>
<div class="Purport">So in that great assembly, Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was the cynosure of neighboring eyes. Everyone wanted to see Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and everyone wanted to pay his humble respects to the Lord. Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva remembered all this and was glad that his worshipful Lord, the Personality of Godhead, was present before him in His actual formal presence. So to meditate on the Supreme Lord is to meditate on the activities, form, pastimes, name and fame of the Lord. That is easier than what is imagined as meditation on the impersonal feature of the Supreme. In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index3958.html?g=4186">12.5</a>) it is clearly stated that to meditate upon the impersonal feature of the Supreme is very difficult. It is practically no meditation or simply a waste of time because very seldom is the desired result obtained. The devotees, however, meditate upon the Lord's factual form and pastimes, and therefore the Lord is easily approachable by the devotees. This is also stated in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index2754.html?g=4217">12.9</a>). The Lord is nondifferent from His transcendental activities. It is indicated also in this <span class="Italic">&#347;loka</span> that Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, while actually present before human society, especially in connection with the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra, was accepted as the greatest personality of the time, although He might not have been recognized as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The propaganda that a very great man is worshiped as God after his death is misleading because a man after his death cannot be made into God. Nor can the Personality of Godhead be a human being, even when He is personally present. Both ideas are misconceptions. The idea of anthropomorphism cannot be applicable in the case of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>

<div class="Translation">Now I can meditate with full concentration upon that one Lord, &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, now present before me because now I have transcended the misconceptions of duality in regard to His presence in everyone's heart, even in the hearts of the mental speculators. He is in everyone's heart. The sun may be perceived differently, but the sun is one.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the one Absolute Supreme Personality of Godhead, but He has expanded Himself into His multiplenary portions by His inconceivable energy. The conception of duality is due to ignorance of His inconceivable energy. In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexa12b.html?g=3084">9.11</a>) the Lord says that only the foolish take Him to be a mere human being. Such foolish men are not aware of His inconceivable energies. By His inconceivable energy He is present in everyone's heart, as the sun is present before everyone all over the world. The Param&#257;tm&#257; feature of the Lord is an expansion of His plenary portions. He expands Himself as Param&#257;tm&#257; in everyone's heart by His inconceivable energy, and He also expands Himself as the glowing effulgence of <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> by expansion of His personal glow. It is stated in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> that the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> is His personal glow. Therefore, there is no difference between Him and His personal glow, <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti,</span> or His plenary portions as Param&#257;tm&#257;. Less intelligent persons who are not aware of this fact consider <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> and Param&#257;tm&#257; to be different from &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. This misconception of duality is completely removed from the mind of Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva, and he is now satisfied that it is Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a only who is all in all in everything. This enlightenment is attained by the great <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;s</span> or devotees, as it is stated in <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index4112.html?g=2631">7.19</a>) that V&#257;sudeva is all in all in everything and that there is no existence of anything without V&#257;sudeva. V&#257;sudeva, or Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, is the original Supreme Person, as now confirmed by a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;jana,</span> and therefore both the neophytes and the pure devotees must try to follow in his footsteps. That is the way of the devotional line.</div>
<div class="Purport">The worshipable object of Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva is Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as P&#257;rtha-s&#257;rathi, and that of the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> is the same K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana as the most attractive &#346;y&#257;masundara. Sometimes less intelligent scholars make a mistake and think that the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana and that of the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra are different personalities. But for Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva this misconception is completely removed. Even the impersonalist's object of destination is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as the impersonal <span class="Italic">jyoti,</span> and the <span class="Italic">yog&#299;'s</span> destination of Param&#257;tm&#257; is also K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is both <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> and localized Param&#257;tm&#257;, but in <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> or Param&#257;tm&#257; there is no K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a or sweet relations with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. In His personal feature K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is both P&#257;rtha-s&#257;rathi and &#346;y&#257;masundara of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, but in His impersonal feature He is neither in the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> nor in the Param&#257;tm&#257;. Great <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;s</span> like Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva realize all these different features of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and therefore they worship Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, knowing Him as the origin of all features.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The stage attained by Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva while quitting his material body is called <span class="Italic">nirvikalpa-sam&#257;dhi</span> because he merged his self into thinking of the Lord and his mind into remembering His different activities. He chanted the glories of the Lord, and by his sight he began to see the Lord personally present before him, and thus all his activities became concentrated upon the Lord without deviation. This is the highest stage of perfection, and it is possible for everyone to attain this stage by practice of devotional service. The devotional service of the Lord consists of nine principles of service activities, and they are (<B>1</B>) hearing, (<B>2</B>) chanting, (<B>3</B>) remembering, (<B>4</B>) serving the lotus feet, (<B>5</B>) worshiping, (<B>6</B>) praying, (<B>7</B>) executing the orders, (<B>8</B>) fraternizing, and (<B>9</B>) fully surrendering. Any one of them or all of them are equally competent to award the desired result, but they require to be practiced persistently under the guidance of an expert devotee of the Lord. The first item, hearing, is the most important item of all, and therefore hearing of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and, later on, <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is essential for the serious candidate who wants to attain the stage of Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva at the end. The unique situation at Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva's time of death can be attained, even though Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a may not be personally present. His words of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> or those of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> are identical with the Lord. They are sound incarnations of the Lord, and one can fully utilize them to be entitled to attain the stage of &#346;r&#299; Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva, who was one of the eight Vasus. Every man or animal must die at a certain stage of life, but one who dies like Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva attains perfection, and one who dies forced by the laws of nature dies like an animal. That is the difference between a man and an animal. The human form of life is especially meant for dying like Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva.</div>

<div class="Translation">Knowing that Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva had merged into the unlimited eternity of the Supreme Absolute, all present there became silent like birds at the end of the day.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">To enter into or to become merged into the unlimited eternity of the Supreme Absolute means to enter the original home of the living being. The living beings are all component parts and parcels of the Absolute Personality of Godhead, and therefore they are eternally related with Him as the servitor and the served. The Lord is served by all His parts and parcels, as the complete machine is served by its parts and parcels. Any part of the machine removed from the whole is no longer important. Similarly, any part and parcel of the Absolute detached from the service of the Lord is useless. The living beings who are in the material world are all disintegrated parts and parcels of the supreme whole, and they are no longer as important as the original parts and parcels. There are, however, more integrated living beings who are eternally liberated. The material energy of the Lord, called Durg&#257;-&#347;akti, or the superintendent of the prison house, takes charge of the disintegrated parts and parcels, and thus they undergo a conditioned life under the laws of material nature. When the living being becomes conscious of this fact, he tries to go back home, back to Godhead, and thus the spiritual urge of the living being begins. This spiritual urge is called <span class="Italic">brahma-jij&ntilde;&#257;s&#257;,</span> or inquiry about Brahman. Principally this <span class="Italic">brahma-jij&ntilde;&#257;s&#257;</span> is successful by knowledge, renunciation and devotional service to the Lord. <span class="Italic">J&ntilde;&#257;na,</span> or knowledge, means knowledge of everything of Brahman, the Supreme; renunciation means detachment of material affection, and devotional service is the revival by practice of the original position of the living being. The successful living beings who are eligible to enter into the realm of the Absolute are called the <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s,</span> the <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> and the <span class="Italic">bhaktas.</span> The <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> enter into the impersonal rays of the Supreme, but the <span class="Italic">bhaktas</span> enter into the spiritual planets known as the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;has. In these spiritual planets the Supreme Lord as N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a predominates, and the healthy, unconditioned living beings live there by rendering loving service to the Lord in the capacity of servant, friend, parents and fiancee. There the unconditioned living beings enjoy life in full freedom with the Lord, whereas the impersonalist <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> enter into the impersonal glowing effulgence of the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets. The Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets are all self-illuminating like the sun, and the rays of the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets are called the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti.</span> The <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> is spread unlimitedly, and the material world is but a covered portion of an insignificant part of the same <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti.</span> This covering is temporary, and therefore it is a sort of illusion.</div>
<div class="Purport">Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva, as a pure devotee of the Lord, entered the spiritual realm in one of the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets where the Lord in His eternal form of <span class="Italic">P&#257;rtha-s&#257;rathi</span> predominates over the unconditioned living beings who are constantly engaged in the service of the Lord. The love and affection which bind the Lord and devotee are exhibited in the case of Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva. Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva never forgot the Lord in His transcendental feature as the <span class="Italic">P&#257;rtha-s&#257;rathi,</span> and the Lord was present personally before Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva while he was passing to the transcendental world. That is the highest perfection of life.</div>

<div class="First">Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva was respected both by the human beings and by the demigods. The human beings live on earth and similar other planets in the Bh&#363;r and Bhuvar group of planets, but the demigods live in the Svar, or heavenly planets, and all of them knew Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva as a great warrior and devotee of the Lord. As a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;jana</span> (or authority) he was on the level of Brahm&#257;, N&#257;rada and &#346;iva, although he was a human being. Qualification on a par with the great demigods is possible only on attainment of spiritual perfection. Thus Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva was known all over the universes, and during his time interplanetary travel was effected by finer methods than the futile endeavors of mechanical spacecraft. When the distant planets were informed of the passing away of Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva, all the inhabitants of the upper planets as well as of the earth dropped showers of flowers to show due respect to the departed great personality. This showering of flowers from heaven is a sign of recognition by great demigods, and it should never be compared to the decoration of a dead body. The body of Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva lost its material effects due to being surcharged with spiritual realization, and thus the body was spiritualized as when iron becomes red-hot when in contact with fire. The body of a fully self-realized soul is not, therefore, accepted as material. Special ceremonies are observed for such spiritual bodies. The respect and recognition of Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva are never to be imitated by artificial means, as it has become a fashion to observe the so-called <span class="Italic">jayant&#299;</span> ceremony for any and every common man. According to authorized <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras,</span> such a <span class="Italic">jayant&#299;</span> ceremony for an ordinary man, however exalted he may be materially, is an offense to the Lord because <span class="Italic">jayant&#299;</span> is reserved for the day when the Lord appears on the earth. Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva was unique in his activities, and his passing away to the kingdom of God is also unique.</div>

Since Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u, the father of the five brothers headed by Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, had died, Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva was the most affectionate grandfather of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas and caretaker of the widow daughter-in-law Kunt&#299;dev&#299;. Although Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra, the elder uncle of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, was there to look after them, his affection was more on the side of his hundred sons, headed by Duryodhana. Ultimately a colossal clique was fabricated to deprive the five fatherless brothers of the rightful claim of the kingdom of Hastin&#257;pura. There was great intrigue, common in imperial palaces, and the five brothers were exiled to the wilderness. But Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva was always a sincerely sympathetic well-wisher, grandfather, friend and philosopher to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, even up to the last moment of his life. He died very happily by seeing Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira to the throne, otherwise he would have long ago quitted his material body, instead of suffering agony over the undue sufferings of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas. He was simply waiting for the opportune moment because he was sure and certain that the sons of P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u would come out victorious in the Battlefield of Kuruk&#7779;etra, as His Lordship &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was their protector. As a devotee of the Lord, he knew that the Lord's devotee cannot be vanquished at any time. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira was quite aware of all these good wishes of Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva, and therefore he must have been feeling the great separation. He was sorry for the separation of a great soul, and not for the material body which Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva relinquished. The funeral ceremony was a necessary duty, although Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva was a liberated soul. Since Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva was without issue, the eldest grandson, namely Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, was the rightful person to perform this ceremony. It was a great boon to Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva that an equally great son of the family undertook the last rites of a great man.</div>

<div class="First">The devotees of the Lord are always in the heart of the Lord, and the Lord is always in the hearts of the devotees. That is the sweet relation between the Lord and His devotees. Due to unalloyed love and devotion for the Lord, the devotees always see Him within themselves, and the Lord also, although He has nothing to do and nothing to aspire to, is always busy in attending to the welfare of His devotees. For the ordinary living beings the law of nature is there for all actions and reactions, but He is always anxious to put His devotees on the right path. The devotees, therefore, are under the direct care of the Lord. And the Lord also voluntarily puts Himself under the care of His devotees only. So all the sages, headed by Vy&#257;sadeva, were devotees of the Lord, and therefore they chanted the Vedic hymns after the funeral ceremony just to please the Lord, who was present there personally. All the Vedic hymns are chanted to please Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. This is confirmed in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a>).

After the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra, the celebrated couple, having lost all their sons and grandsons, were under the care of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira. They were passing their days in great agony over such a heavy loss of life and were practically living the life of ascetics. The death news of Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva, uncle of Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra, was another great shock for the King and the Queen, and therefore they required solace from Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira was conscious of his duty, and he at once hurried to the spot with Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and satisfied the bereaved Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra with kind words, from both himself and the Lord also.</div>
<div class="Purport">G&#257;ndh&#257;r&#299; was a powerful ascetic, although she was living the life of a faithful wife and a kind mother.

And G&#257;ndh&#257;r&#299; was so true to her husband that she followed him even in his perpetual blindness. Therefore in her actions she was a great ascetic. Besides that, the shock she suffered because of the wholesale killing of her one hundred sons and her grandsons also was certainly too much for a woman. But she suffered all this just like an ascetic. G&#257;ndh&#257;r&#299;, although a woman, is no less than Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva in character.

<div class="First">This world is compared to a forest fire caused by the cohesion of bamboo bushes. Such a forest fire takes place automatically, for bamboo cohesion occurs without external cause. Similarly, in the material world the wrath of those who want to lord it over material nature interacts, and the fire of war takes place, exhausting the unwanted population. Such fires or wars take place, and the Lord has nothing to do with them. But because He wants to maintain the creation, He desires the mass of people to follow the right path of self-realization, which enables the living beings to enter into the kingdom of God. The Lord wants the suffering human beings to come back home, back to Him, and cease to suffer the threefold material pangs. The whole plan of creation is made in that way, and one who does not come to his senses suffers in the material world by pangs inflicted by the illusory energy of the Lord. The Lord therefore wants His bona fide representative to rule the world. Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a descended to establish this sort of regime and to kill the unwanted persons who have nothing to do with His plan. The Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra was fought according to the plan of the Lord so that undesirable persons could get out of the world and a peaceful kingdom under His devotee could be established.

Even if he is enlightened like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, he cannot do anything out of his own good will due to his constitutional position. Therefore, there are so many states over the earth quarreling because of ideological differences or other selfish motives. But a king like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira had no ideology of his own. He had but to follow the instructions of the infallible Lord and the Lord's representative and the authorized agent, Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva. It is instructed in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> that one should follow the great authority and the infallible Lord without any personal motive and manufactured ideology. Therefore, it was possible for Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira to rule the whole world, including the seas, because the principles were infallible and universally applicable to everyone. The conception of one world state can only be fulfilled if we can follow the infallible authority. An imperfect human being cannot create an ideology acceptable to everyone. Only the perfect and the infallible can create a program which is applicable at every place and can be followed by all in the world. It is the person who rules, and not the impersonal government. If the person is perfect, the government is perfect. If the person is a fool, the government is a fool's paradise. That is the law of nature. There are so many stories of imperfect kings or executive heads. Therefore, the executive head must be a trained person like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, and he must have the full autocratic power to rule over the world. The conception of a world state can take shape only under the regime of a perfect king like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira. The world was happy in those days because there were kings like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira to rule over the world.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">During the reign of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, the clouds showered all the water that people needed, and the earth produced all the necessities of man in profusion. Due to its fatty milk bag and cheerful attitude, the cow used to moisten the grazing ground with milk.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The basic principle of economic development is centered on <span class="Italic">land</span> and <span class="Italic">cows.</span> The necessities of human society are food grains, fruits, milk, minerals, clothing, wood, etc. One requires all these items to fulfill the material needs of the body. Certainly one does not require flesh and fish or iron tools and machinery. During the regime of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, all over the world there were regulated rainfalls. Rainfalls are not in the control of the human being. The heavenly King Indradeva is the controller of rains, and he is the servant of the Lord. When the Lord is obeyed by the king and the people under the king's administration, there are regulated rains from the horizon, and these rains are the causes of all varieties of production on the land. Not only do regulated rains help ample production of grains and fruits, but when they combine with astronomical influences there is ample production of valuable stones and pearls. Grains and vegetables can sumptuously feed a man and animals, and a fatty cow delivers enough milk to supply a man sumptuously with vigor and vitality. If there is enough milk, enough grains, enough fruit, enough cotton, enough silk and enough jewels, then why do the people need cinemas, houses of prostitution, slaughterhouses, etc.? What is the need of an artificial luxurious life of cinema, cars, radio, flesh and hotels? Has this civilization produced anything but quarreling individually and nationally? Has this civilization enhanced the cause of equality and fraternity by sending thousands of men into a hellish factory and the war fields at the whims of a particular man?</div>
<div class="Purport">It is said here that the cows used to moisten the pasturing land with milk because their milk bags were fatty and the animals were joyful. Do they not require, therefore, proper protection for a joyful life by being fed with a sufficient quantity of grass in the field? Why should men kill cows for their selfish purposes? Why should man not be satisfied with grains, fruits and milk, which, combined together, can produce hundreds and thousands of palatable dishes. Why are there slaughterhouses all over the world to kill innocent animals? Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, grandson of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, while touring his vast kingdom, saw a black man attempting to kill a cow. The King at once arrested the butcher and chastised him sufficiently. Should not a king or executive head protect the lives of the poor animals who are unable to defend themselves? Is this humanity? Are not the animals of a country citizens also? Then why are they allowed to be butchered in organized slaughterhouses? Are these the signs of equality, fraternity and nonviolence?</div>
<div class="Purport">Therefore, in contrast with the modern, advanced, civilized form of government, an autocracy like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira's is by far superior to a so-called democracy in which animals are killed and a man less than an animal is allowed to cast votes for another less-than-animal man.</div>
<div class="Purport">We are all creatures of material nature. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is said that the Lord Himself is the seed-giving father and material nature is the mother of <span class="Italic">all living beings in all shapes.</span> Thus mother material nature has enough foodstuff both for animals and for men, by the grace of the Father Almighty, &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The human being is the elder brother of all other living beings. He is endowed with intelligence more powerful than animals for realizing the course of nature and the indications of the Almighty Father. Human civilizations should depend on the production of material nature without artificially attempting economic development to turn the world into a chaos of artificial greed and power only for the purpose of artificial luxuries and sense gratification. This is but the life of dogs and hogs.</div>

<div class="Translation">The rivers, oceans, hills, mountains, forests, creepers and active drugs, in every season, paid their tax quota to the King in profusion.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Since Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira was under the protection of the <span class="Italic">ajita,</span> the infallible Lord, as above mentioned, the properties of the Lord, namely the rivers, oceans, hills, forests, etc., were all pleased, and they used to supply their respective quota of taxes to the King. The secret to success <span class="Italic">is to take refuge under the protection of the Supreme Lord.</span> Without His sanction, nothing can be possible. To make economic development by our own endeavors on the strength of tools and machinery is not all. The sanction of the Supreme Lord must be there, otherwise despite all instrumental arrangements everything will be unsuccessful. The ultimate cause of success is the <span class="Italic">daiva,</span> the Supreme. Kings like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira knew perfectly well that the king is the agent of the Supreme Lord to look after the welfare of the mass of people. Actually the state belongs to the Supreme Lord. The rivers, oceans, forests, hills, drugs, etc., are not creations of man. They are all creations of the Supreme Lord, and the living being is allowed to make use of the property of the Lord for the service of the Lord. Today's slogan is that everything is for the people, and therefore the government is for the people and by the people. But to produce a new species of humanity at the present moment on the basis of God consciousness and perfection of human life, the ideology of godly communism, the world has to again follow in the footsteps of kings like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira or Par&#299;k&#7779;it. There is enough of everything by the will of the Lord, and we can make proper use of things to live comfortably without enmity between men, or animal and man or nature. The control of the Lord is everywhere, and if the Lord is pleased, every part of nature will be pleased. The river will flow profusely to fertilize the land; the oceans will supply sufficient quantities of minerals, pearls and jewels; the forest will supply sufficient wood, drugs and vegetables, and the seasonal changes will effectively help produce fruits and flowers in profuse quantity. The artificial way of living depending on factories and tools can render so-called happiness only to a limited number at the cost of millions. Since the energy of the mass of people is engaged in factory production, the natural products are being hampered, and for this the mass is unhappy. Without being educated properly, the mass of people are following in the footsteps of the vested interests by exploiting natural reserves, and therefore there is acute competition between individual and individual and nation and nation. There is no control by the trained agent of the Lord. We must look into the defects of modern civilization by comparison here, and should follow in the footsteps of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira to cleanse man and wipe out anachronisms.</div>

<div class="Translation">Because of the King's having no enemy, the living beings were not at any time disturbed by mental agonies, diseases, or excessive heat or cold.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">To be nonviolent to human beings and to be a killer or enemy of the poor animals is Satan's philosophy. In this age there is enmity toward poor animals, and therefore the poor creatures are always anxious. The reaction of the poor animals is being forced on human society, and therefore there is always the strain of cold or hot war between men, individually, collectively or nationally. At the time of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, there were no different nations, although there were different subordinate states. The whole world was united, and the supreme head, being a trained king like Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, kept all the inhabitants free from anxiety, diseases and excessive heat and cold. They were not only economically well-to-do, but also physically fit and undisturbed by supernatural power, by enmity from other living beings and by disturbance of bodily and mental agonies. There is a proverb in Bengali that a bad king spoils the kingdom and a bad housewife spoils the family. This truth is applicable here also. Because the King was pious and obedient to the Lord and sages, because he was no one's enemy and because he was a recognized agent of the Lord and therefore protected by Him, all the citizens under the King's protection were, so to speak, directly protected by the Lord and His authorized agents. Unless one is pious and recognized by the Lord, he cannot make others happy who are under his care. There is full cooperation between man and God and man and nature, and this conscious cooperation between man and God and man and nature, as exemplified by King Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, can bring about happiness, peace and prosperity in the world. The attitude of exploiting one another, the custom of the day, will only bring misery.</div>

<div class="First">Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is so attractive for the living beings, especially for the devotees, that it is impossible for them to tolerate separation. The conditioned soul under the spell of illusory energy forgets the Lord, otherwise he cannot. The feeling of such separation cannot be described, but it can simply be imagined by devotees only. After His separation from V&#7771;nd&#257;vana and the innocent rural cowherd boys, girls, ladies and others, they all felt shock throughout their lives, and the separation of R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;&#7751;&#299;, the most beloved cowherd girl, is beyond expression. Once they met at Kuruk&#7779;etra during a solar eclipse, and the feeling which was expressed by them is heartrending. There is, of course, a difference in the qualities of the transcendental devotees of the Lord, but none of them who have ever contacted the Lord by direct communion or otherwise can leave Him for a moment. That is the attitude of the pure devotee.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">The intelligent, who have understood the Supreme Lord in association with pure devotees and have become freed from bad materialistic association, can never avoid hearing the glories of the Lord, even though they have heard them only once. How, then, could the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas tolerate His separation, for they had been intimately associated with His person, seeing Him face to face, touching Him, conversing with Him, and sleeping, sitting and dining with Him?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The living being's constitutional position is one of serving a superior. He is obliged to serve by force the dictates of illusory material energy in different phases of sense gratification. And in serving the senses he is never tired. Even though he may be tired, the illusory energy perpetually forces him to do so without being satisfied. There is no end to such sense gratificatory business, and the conditioned soul becomes entangled in such servitude without hope of release. The release is only effected by association with pure devotees. By such association one is gradually promoted to his transcendental consciousness. Thus he can know that his eternal position is to render service unto the Lord and not to the perverted senses in the capacity of lust, anger, desire to lord it over, etc. Material society, friendship and love are all different phases of lust. Home, country, family, society, wealth and all sorts of corollaries are all causes of bondage in the material world, where the threefold miseries of life are concomitant factors. By associating with pure devotees and by hearing them submissively, attachment for material enjoyment becomes slackened, and attraction for hearing about the transcendental activities of the Lord becomes prominent. Once they are, they will go on progressively without stoppage, like fire in gunpowder. It is said that Hari, the Personality of Godhead, is so transcendentally attractive that even those who are self-satisfied by self-realization and are factually liberated from all material bondage also become devotees of the Lord. Under the circumstances it is easily understood what must have been the position of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, who were constant companions of the Lord. They could not even think of separation from &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, since the attraction was more intense for them because of continuous personal contact. His remembrance by His form, quality, name, fame, pastimes, etc., is also attractive for the pure devotee, so much so that he forgets all forms, quality, name, fame and activities of the mundane world, and due to his mature association with pure devotees he is not out of contact with the Lord for a moment.</div>

<div class="First">There were hundreds of ladies in the palace of Hastin&#257;pura. All of them were affectionate to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. All of them were relatives also. When they saw that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was going away from the palace for His native place, they were very anxious for Him, and as usual tears began to roll down their cheeks. They thought, at the same time, that tears at that moment might be a cause of misfortune for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a; therefore they wanted to check them. This was very difficult for them because the tears could not be checked. Therefore, they smeared their tears in their eyes, and their hearts throbbed. Therefore ladies who were the wives and daughters-in-law of those who died in the battlefield never came in direct contact with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. But all of them heard of Him and His great activities, and thus they thought of Him, talked of Him, His name, fame, etc., and became affectionate also, like those who were in direct contact. Therefore directly or indirectly anyone who thinks of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, talks of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a or worships K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a becomes attached to Him. Because K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is absolute, there is no difference between His name, form, quality, etc. Our intimate relation with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a can be confidentially revived by our talking of, hearing of, or remembering Him.

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Out of a loving desire to see the Lord, the royal ladies of the Kurus got up on top of the palace, and smiling with affection and shyness, they showered flowers upon the Lord.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Shyness is a particular extra-natural beauty of the fair sex, and it commands respect from the opposite sex. This custom was observed even during the days of the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata,</span> i.e., more than five thousand years ago. It is only the less intelligent persons not well versed in the history of the world who say that observance of separation of female from male is an introduction of the Mohammedan period in India. This incident from the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> period proves definitely that the ladies of the palace observed strict <span class="Italic">pard&#257;</span> (restricted association with men), and instead of coming down in the open air where Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and others were assembled, the ladies of the palace went up on the top of the palace and from there paid their respects to Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a by showers of flowers. It is definitely stated here that the ladies were smiling there on the top of the palace, checked by shyness. This shyness is a gift of nature to the fair sex, and it enhances their beauty and prestige, even if they are of a less important family or even if they are less attractive. We have practical experience of this fact. A sweeper woman commanded the respect of many respectable gentlemen simply by manifesting a lady's shyness. Half-naked ladies in the street do not command any respect, but a shy sweeper's wife commands respect from all.</div>
<div class="Purport">Human civilization, as conceived of by the sages of India, is to help one free himself from the clutches of illusion. The material beauty of a woman is an illusion because actually the body is made of earth, water, fire, air, etc. But because there is the association of the living spark with matter, it appears to be beautiful. No one is attracted by an earthen doll, even if it is most perfectly prepared to attract the attention of others. The dead body has no beauty because no one will accept the dead body of a so-called beautiful woman. Therefore, the conclusion is that the spirit spark is beautiful, and because of the soul's beauty one is attracted by the beauty of the outward body. The Vedic wisdom, therefore, forbids us to be attracted by false beauty. But because we are now in the darkness of ignorance, the Vedic civilization allows very restricted mixing of woman and man. They say that the woman is considered to be the fire, and the man is considered to be the butter. The butter must melt in association with fire, and therefore they may be brought together only when it is necessary. And shyness is a check to the unrestricted mixing. It is nature's gift, and it must be utilized.</div>

<div class="First">At places there were sounds of Vedic benediction aiming at the Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The benedictions were fitting in the sense that the Lord was playing the part of a human being, as if a cousin of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, but they were also unfitting because the Lord is absolute and has nothing to do with any kind of material relativities. He is <span class="Italic">nirgu&#7751;a,</span> or there are no material qualities in Him, but He is full of transcendental qualities. In the transcendental world there is nothing contradictory, whereas in the relative world everything has its opposite. In the relative world white is the opposite conception of black, but in the transcendental world there is no distinction between white and black. Therefore the sounds of benedictions uttered by the learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> here and there appear to be contradictory in relation with the Absolute Person, but when they are applied to the Absolute Person they lose all contradiction and become transcendental. One example may clear this idea. Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is sometimes described as a thief. He is very famous amongst His pure devotees as the M&#257;khana-cora. He used to steal butter from the houses of neighbors at V&#7771;nd&#257;vana in His early age. Since then He is famous as a thief. But in spite of His being famous as a thief, He is worshiped as a thief, whereas in the mundane world a thief is punished and is never praised. Since He is the Absolute Personality of Godhead, everything is applicable to Him, and still in spite of all contradictions He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation">Absorbed in the thought of the transcendental qualities of the Lord, who is glorified in select poetry, the ladies on the roofs of all the houses of Hastin&#257;pura began to talk of Him. This talk was more attractive than the hymns of the Vedas.<span class="Italic"></span></div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is said that in all the Vedic literatures the goal is the Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Factually the glories of the Lord are depicted in such literature as the <span class="Italic">Vedas, R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata.</span> And in the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> they are specifically mentioned in respect to the Supreme Lord. Therefore, while the ladies on the tops of the houses in the capital of the kings of the Kuru dynasty were talking about the Lord, their talk was more pleasing than the Vedic hymns. Anything sung in the praise of the Lord is <span class="Italic">&#346;ruti-mantra.</span> There are songs of &#7788;h&#257;kura Narottama d&#257;sa, one of the <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> in the Gau&#7693;&#299;ya-samprad&#257;ya, composed in simple Bengali language. But &#7788;h&#257;kura Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299;, another very learned <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya</span> of the same <span class="Italic">samprad&#257;ya,</span> has approved the songs by &#7788;h&#257;kura Narottama d&#257;sa to be as good as Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras.</span> And this is so because of the subject matter. The language is immaterial, but the subject matter is important. The ladies, who were all absorbed in the thought and actions of the Lord, developed the consciousness of Vedic wisdom by the grace of the Lord. And therefore although such ladies might not have been very learned scholars in Sanskrit or otherwise, still whatever they spoke was more attractive than the Vedic hymns.

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">They said: Here He is, the original Personality of Godhead as we definitely remember Him. He alone existed before the manifested creation of the modes of nature, and in Him only, because He is the Supreme Lord, all living beings merge, as if sleeping at night, their energy suspended.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">There are two types of dissolution of the manifested cosmos. At the end of every 4,320,000,000 solar years, when Brahm&#257;, the lord of one particular universe, goes to sleep, there is one annihilation. And at the end of Lord Brahm&#257;'s life, which takes place at the end of Brahm&#257;'s one hundred years of age, in our calculation at the end of 8,640,000,000 x 30 x 12 x 100 solar years, there is complete annihilation of the entire universe, and in both the periods both the material energy called the <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva</span> and the marginal energy called <span class="Italic">j&#299;va-tattva</span> merge in the person of the Supreme Lord. The living beings remain asleep within the body of the Lord until there is another creation of the material world, and that is the way of the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the material manifestation.</div>
<div class="Purport">The material creation is effected by the interaction of the three modes of material nature set in action by the Lord, and therefore it is said here that the Lord existed before the modes of material nature were set in motion. In the <span class="Italic">&#346;ruti-mantra</span> it is said that only Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Supreme Lord, existed before the creation, and there was no Brahm&#257;, &#346;iva or other demigods. Vi&#7779;&#7751;u means the Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, who is lying on the Causal Ocean. By His breathing only all the universes are generated in seeds and gradually develop into gigantic forms with innumerable planets within each and every universe. The seeds of universes develop into gigantic forms in the way seeds of a banyan tree develop into numberless banyan trees.</div>
<div class="Purport">This Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is the plenary portion of the Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> as follows:</div>
<div class="Purport">"Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the original Personality of Godhead, Govinda, whose plenary portion is the Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. All the Brahm&#257;s, the heads of the universes, live only for the period of His exhaling, after the universes are generated from the pores of His transcendental body." (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bs.</span> 5.58)</div>
<div class="Purport">Thus Govinda, or Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, is the cause of Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u also. The ladies talking about this Vedic truth must have heard it from authoritative sources. An authoritative source is the only means of knowing about transcendental subject matter definitely. There is no alternative.</div>
<div class="Purport">The merging of the living beings into the body of Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u takes place automatically at the end of Brahm&#257;'s one hundred years. But that does not mean that the individual living being loses his identity. The identity is there, and as soon as there is another creation by the supreme will of the Lord, all the sleeping, inactive living beings are again let loose to begin their activities in the continuation of past different spheres of life. It is called <span class="Italic">suptotthita naya,</span> or awakening from sleep and again engaging in one's respective continuous duty. When a man is asleep at night, he forgets himself, what he is, what his duty is and everything of his waking state. But as soon as he awakens from slumber, he remembers all that he has to do and thus engages himself again in his prescribed activities. The living beings also remain merged in the body of Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u during the period of annihilation, but as soon as there is another creation they arise to take up their unfinished work. This is also confirmed in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexf726.html?g=2895">8.18</a>-20).</div>
<div class="Purport">The Lord existed before the creative energy was set in action. The Lord is not a product of the material energy. His body is completely spiritual, and there is no difference between His body and Himself. Before creation the Lord remained in His abode, which is absolute and one.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">The Personality of Godhead, again desiring to give names and forms to His parts and parcels, the living entities, placed them under the guidance of material nature. By His own potency, material nature is empowered to re-create.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The living entities are parts and parcels of the Lord. They are of two varieties, namely <span class="Italic">nitya-mukta</span> and <span class="Italic">nitya-baddha.</span> The <span class="Italic">nitya-muktas</span> are eternally liberated souls, and they are eternally engaged in the reciprocation of transcendental loving service with the Lord in His eternal abode beyond the manifested mundane creations. But the <span class="Italic">nitya-baddha,</span> or eternally conditioned souls, are entrusted to His external energy, <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> for rectification of their rebellious attitude toward the Supreme Father. <span class="Italic">Nitya-baddhas</span> are eternally forgetful of their relation with the Lord as parts and parcels. They are bewildered by the illusory energy as products of matter, and thus they are very busy in making plans in the material world for becoming happy. They go on merrily with plans, but by the will of the Lord both the planmakers and the plans are annihilated at the end of a certain period, as above mentioned. This is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as follows: "O son of Kunt&#299;, at the end of the millennium all the living entities merge into My nature, and again when the time of creation is ripe, I begin creation by the agency of My external energy." (Bg. <a href="index73d2.html?g=3048">9.7</a>)</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">bh&#363;ya&#7717;</span> indicates again and again, that is to say the process of creation, maintenance and annihilation is going on perpetually by the external energy of the Lord. He is the cause of everything. But the living beings, who are constitutionally the parts and parcels of the Lord and are forgetful of the sweet relation, are given a chance again to get rid of the clutches of the external energy. And to revive his (the living being's) consciousness, the revealed scriptures are also created by the Lord. Vedic literatures are the guiding directions for the conditioned souls so they can get free from the repetition of creation and annihilation of the material world and the material body.</div>
<div class="Purport">The Lord says in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> "This created world and material energy are under My control. Under the influence of <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti,</span> automatically they are created again and again, and this is done by Me through the agency of My external energy."</div>
<div class="Purport">Actually the spiritual spark living entities have no material names or forms. But in order to fulfill their desire to lord it over the material energy of material forms and names, they are given a chance for such false enjoyment, and at the same time they are given a chance to understand the real position through the revealed scriptures. The foolish and forgetful living being is always busy with false forms and false names. Modern nationalism is the culmination of such false names and false forms. Men are mad after false name and form. The form of body obtained under certain conditions is taken up as factual, and the name also taken bewilders the conditioned soul into misusing the energy in the name of so many "isms." The scriptures, however, supply the clue for understanding the real position, but men are reluctant to take lessons from the scriptures created by the Lord for different places and times. For example, the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> is the guiding principle for every human being, but by the spell of material energy they do not take care to carry out the programs of life in terms of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the post-graduate study of knowledge for one who has thoroughly understood the principles of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> Unfortunately people have no taste for them, and therefore they are under the clutches of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> for repetition of birth and death.</div>

<div class="Translation">Here is the same Supreme Personality of Godhead whose transcendental form is experienced by the great devotees who are completely cleansed of material consciousness by dint of rigid devotional service and full control of life and the senses. And that is the only way to purify existence.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">As it is stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> the Lord can be known in His real nature by dint of pure devotional service only. So it is stated here that only the great devotees of the Lord who are able to clear the mind of all material dust by rigid devotional service can experience the Lord as He is. <span class="Italic">Jitendriya</span> means one who has full control over the senses. The senses are active parts of the body, and their activities cannot be stopped. The artificial means of the yogic processes to make the senses inactive has proved to be abject failure, even in the case of great <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> like Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra Muni. Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra Muni controlled the senses by yogic trance, but when he happened to meet Menak&#257; (a heavenly society woman), he became a victim of sex, and the artificial way of controlling the senses failed. But in the case of a pure devotee, the senses are not at all artificially stopped from doing anything, but they are given different good engagements. When the senses are engaged in more attractive activities, there is no chance of their being attracted by any inferior engagements. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is said that <span class="Italic">the senses can be controlled only by better engagements.</span> Devotional service necessitates purifying the senses or engaging them in the activities of devotional service. Devotional service is not inaction. Anything done in the service of the Lord becomes at once purified of its material nature. The material conception is due to ignorance only. There is nothing beyond V&#257;sudeva. The V&#257;sudeva conception gradually develops in the heart of the learned after a prolonged acceleration of the receptive organs. But the process ends in the knowledge of accepting V&#257;sudeva as all in all. In the case of devotional service, this very same method is accepted from the very beginning, and by the grace of the Lord all factual knowledge becomes revealed in the heart of a devotee due to dictation by the Lord from within. Therefore controlling the senses by devotional service is the only and easiest means.</div>

<div class="Translation">Whenever there are kings and administrators living like animals in the lowest modes of existence, the Lord in His transcendental form manifests His supreme power, the Truth Positive, shows special mercy to the faithful, performs wonderful activities and manifests various transcendental forms as is necessary in different periods and ages.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">As mentioned above, the cosmic creation is the property of the Supreme Lord. This is the basic philosophy of <span class="Italic">&#298;&#347;opani&#7779;ad:</span> everything is the property of the Supreme Being. No one should encroach upon the property of the Supreme Lord. One should accept only what is kindly awarded by Him. Therefore, the earth or any other planet or universe is the absolute property of the Lord. The living beings are certainly His parts and parcels, or sons, and thus every one of them has a right to live at the mercy of the Lord to execute his prescribed work. No one, therefore, can encroach upon the right of another individual man or animal without being so sanctioned by the Lord. The king or the administrator is the representative of the Lord to look after the management of the Lord's will. He must therefore be a recognized person like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira or Par&#299;k&#7779;it. Such kings have full responsibility and knowledge from authorities about the administration of the world. But at times, due to the influence of the ignorance mode of material nature (<span class="Italic">tamo-gu&#7751;a</span>), the lowest of the material modes, kings and administrators come into power without knowledge and responsibility, and such foolish administrators live like animals for the sake of their own personal interest. The result is that the whole atmosphere becomes surcharged with anarchy and vicious elements. Nepotism, bribery, cheating, aggression and, therefore, famine, epidemic, war and similar other disturbing features become prominent in human society. And the devotees of the Lord or the faithful are persecuted by all means. All these symptoms indicate the time of an incarnation of the Lord to reestablish the principles of religion and to vanquish the maladministrators. This is also confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">The Lord then appears in His transcendental form without any tinge of material qualities. He descends just to keep the state of His creation in a normal condition. The normal condition is that the Lord has provided each and every planet with all the needs of the native living beings. They can happily live and execute their predestined occupations to attain salvation at the end, following the rules and regulations mentioned in the revealed scriptures. The material world is created to satisfy the whims of the <span class="Italic">nitya-baddha,</span> or everlasting conditioned souls, just as naughty boys are provided with playing cradles. Otherwise, there was no need of the material world. But when they become intoxicated with the power of material science to exploit the resources unlawfully without the sanction of the Lord, and that also only for sense gratification, there is necessity of the Lord's incarnation to chastise the rebellious and to protect the faithful.</div>
<div class="Purport">When He descends, He exhibits superhuman acts just to prove His supreme right, and materialists like R&#257;va&#7751;a, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu and Ka&#7745;sa are sufficiently punished. He acts in a manner which no one can imitate. For example, the Lord, when He appeared as R&#257;ma, bridged the Indian Ocean. When He appeared as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, from His very childhood He showed superhuman activities by killing P&#363;tan&#257;, Agh&#257;sura, &#346;aka&#7789;&#257;sura, K&#257;liya, etc., and then His maternal uncle Ka&#7745;sa. When He was at Dv&#257;rak&#257; He married 16,108 queens, and all of them were blessed with a sufficient number of children. The sum total of His personal family members amounted to about 100,000, popularly known as the Yadu-va&#7745;&#347;a. And again, during His lifetime, He managed to vanquish them all. He is famous as the Govardhana-dh&#257;r&#299; Hari because He lifted at the age of only seven the hill known as Govardhana.

<div class="Translation">Oh, how supremely glorified is the dynasty of King Yadu, and how virtuous is the land of Mathur&#257;, where the supreme leader of all living beings, the husband of the goddess of fortune, has taken His birth and wandered in His childhood.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a has expressively given a description of His transcendental appearance, disappearance and activities. The Lord appears in a particular family or place by His inconceivable potency. He does not take His birth as a conditioned soul quits his body and accepts another body. His birth is like the appearance and disappearance of the sun. The sun arises on the eastern horizon, but that does not mean that the eastern horizon is the parent of the sun. The sun is existent in every part of the solar system, but he becomes visible at a scheduled time and so also becomes invisible at another scheduled time. Similarly, the Lord appears in this universe like the sun and again leaves our sight at another time. He exists at all times and at every place, but by His causeless mercy when He appears before us we take it for granted that He has taken His birth. Anyone who can understand this truth, in terms of the statements of revealed scriptures, certainly becomes liberated just after quitting the present body. Liberation is obtainable after many births and after great endeavor in patience and perseverance, in knowledge and renunciation. But simply by knowing in truth about the Lord's transcendental births and activities, one can get liberation at once. That is the verdict of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> But those who are in the darkness of ignorance conclude that the Lord's birth and activities in the material world are similar to those of the ordinary living being. Such imperfect conclusions cannot give anyone liberation. His birth, therefore, in the family of King Yadu as the son of King Vasudeva and His transfer into the family of Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja in the land of Mathur&#257; are all transcendental arrangements made by the internal potency of the Lord. The fortunes of the Yadu dynasty and that of the inhabitants of the land of Mathur&#257; cannot be materially estimated. If simply by knowing the transcendental nature of the birth and activities of the Lord one can get liberation easily, we can just imagine what is in store for those who actually enjoyed the company of the Lord in person as a family member or as a neighbor. All those who were fortunate enough to associate with the Lord, the husband of the goddess of fortune, certainly obtained something <span class="Italic">more than what is known as liberation.</span> Therefore, rightly, the dynasty and the land are both ever glorious by the grace of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Undoubtedly it is wonderful that Dv&#257;rak&#257; has defeated the glories of the heavenly planets and has enhanced the celebrity of the earth. The inhabitants of Dv&#257;rak&#257; are always seeing the soul of all living beings [K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a] in His loving feature. He glances at them and favors them with sweet smiles.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The heavenly planets are inhabited by demigods like Indra, Candra, Varu&#7751;a and V&#257;yu and the pious souls reach there after performance of many virtuous acts on earth. Modern scientists agree that the timing arrangement in higher planetary systems is different from that of the earth. Thus it is understood from the revealed scriptures that the duration of life there is ten thousand years (by our calculation). Six months on earth is equal to one day on the heavenly planets. Facilities of enjoyment are also similarly enhanced, and the beauty of the inhabitants is legendary. Common men on the earth are very much fond of reaching the heavenly planets because they have heard that comforts of life are far greater there than on the earth. They are now trying to reach the moon by spacecraft. Considering all this, the heavenly planets are more celebrated than the earth. But the celebrity of earth has defeated that of the heavenly planets because of Dv&#257;rak&#257;, where Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a reigned as King. Three places, namely V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, Mathur&#257; and Dv&#257;rak&#257;, are more important than the famous planets within the universe. These places are perpetually sanctified because whenever the Lord descends on earth He displays His transcendental activities particularly in these three places. They are perpetually the holy lands of the Lord, and the inhabitants still take advantage of the holy places, even though the Lord is now out of their sight. The Lord is the soul of all living beings, and He desires always to have all the living beings, in their <span class="Italic">svar&#363;pa,</span> in their constitutional position, to participate in transcendental life in His association. His attractive features and sweet smiles go deep into the heart of everyone, and once it is so done the living being is admitted into the kingdom of God, from which no one returns. This is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">The heavenly planets may be very famous for offering better facilities of material enjoyment, but as we learn from the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index3126.html?g=3165">9.20</a>-21), one has to come back again to the earth planet as soon as the acquired virtue is finished. Dv&#257;rak&#257; is certainly more important than the heavenly planets because whoever has been favored with the smiling glance of the Lord shall never come back again to this rotten earth, which is certified by the Lord Himself as a place of misery. Not only this earth but also all the planets of the universes are places of misery because in none of the planets within the universe is there eternal life, eternal bliss and eternal knowledge. Any person engaged in the devotional service of the Lord is recommended to live in one of the above-mentioned three places, namely Dv&#257;rak&#257;, Mathur&#257; or V&#7771;nd&#257;vana. Because devotional service in these three places is magnified, those who go there to follow the principles in terms of instructions imparted in the revealed scriptures surely achieve the same result as obtained during the presence of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. His abode and He Himself are identical, and a pure devotee under the guidance of another experienced devotee can obtain all the results, even at present.</div>

<div class="Translation">O friends, just think of His wives, whose hands He has accepted. How they must have undergone vows, baths, fire sacrifices and perfect worship of the Lord of the universe to constantly relish now the nectar from His lips [by kissing]. The damsels of Vrajabh&#363;mi would often faint just by expecting such favors.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Religious rites prescribed in the scriptures are meant to purify the mundane qualities of the conditioned souls to enable them to be gradually promoted to the stage of rendering transcendental service unto the Supreme Lord. Attainment of this stage of pure spiritual life is the highest perfection, and this stage is called <span class="Italic">svar&#363;pa,</span> or the factual identity of the living being. Liberation means renovation of this stage of <span class="Italic">svar&#363;pa.</span> In that perfect stage of <span class="Italic">svar&#363;pa,</span> the living being is established in five phases of loving service, one of which is the stage of <span class="Italic">m&#257;dhurya-rasa,</span> or the humor of conjugal love. The Lord is always perfect in Himself, and thus He has no hankering for Himself. He, however, becomes a master, a friend, a son or a husband to fulfill the intense love of the devotee concerned. Herein two classes of devotees of the Lord are mentioned in the stage of conjugal love. One is <span class="Italic">svak&#299;ya,</span> and the other is <span class="Italic">parak&#299;ya.</span> Both of them are in conjugal love with the Personality of Godhead K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The queens at Dv&#257;rak&#257; were <span class="Italic">svak&#299;ya,</span> or duly married wives, but the damsels of Vraja were young friends of the Lord while He was unmarried. The Lord stayed at V&#7771;nd&#257;vana till the age of sixteen, and His friendly relations with the neighboring girls were in terms of <span class="Italic">parak&#299;ya.</span> These girls, as well as the queens, underwent severe penances by taking vows, bathing and offering sacrifices in the fire, as prescribed in the scriptures. The rites, as they are, are not an end in themselves, nor are fruitive action, culture of knowledge or perfection in mystic powers ends in themselves. They are all means to attain to the highest stage of <span class="Italic">svar&#363;pa,</span> to render constitutional transcendental service to the Lord. Each and every living being has his individual position in one of the above-mentioned five different kinds of reciprocating means with the Lord, and in one's pure spiritual form of <span class="Italic">svar&#363;pa</span> the relation becomes manifest without mundane affinity. The kissing of the Lord, either by His wives or His young girl friends who aspired to have the Lord as their fiance, is not of any mundane perverted quality. Had such things been mundane, a liberated soul like &#346;ukadeva would not have taken the trouble to relish them, nor would Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu have been inclined to participate in those subjects after renouncing worldly life. The stage is earned after many lives of penance.</div>

<div class="Translation">The children of these ladies are Pradyumna, S&#257;mba, Amba, etc: Ladies like Rukmi&#7751;&#299;, Satyabh&#257;m&#257; and J&#257;mbavat&#299; were forcibly taken away by Him from their svaya&#7745;vara ceremonies after He defeated many powerful kings, headed by &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la. And other ladies were also forcibly taken away by Him after He killed Bhaum&#257;sura and thousands of his assistants. All of these ladies are glorious.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Exceptionally qualified daughters of powerful kings were allowed to make a choice of their own bridegrooms in open competition, and such ceremonies were called <span class="Italic">svaya&#7745;vara,</span> or selection of the bridegroom. Because the <span class="Italic">svaya&#7745;vara</span> was an open competition between the rival and valiant princes, such princes were invited by the father of the princess, and usually there were regular fights between the invited princely order in a sporting spirit. But it so happened that sometimes the belligerent princes were killed in such marriage-fighting, and the victorious prince was offered the trophy princess for whom so many princes died. Rukmi&#7751;&#299;, the principal queen of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, was the daughter of the King of Vidarbha, who wished that his qualified and beautiful daughter be given away to Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. But her eldest brother wanted her to be given away to King &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la, who happened to be a cousin of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. So there was open competition, and as usual Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a emerged successful, after harassing &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la and other princes by His unrivalled prowess. Rukmi&#7751;&#299; had ten sons, like Pradyumna. There were other queens also taken away by Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in a similar way. Full description of this beautiful booty of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a will be given in the Tenth Canto. There were 16,100 beautiful girls who were daughters of many kings and were forcibly stolen by Bhaum&#257;sura, who kept them captive for his carnal desire. These girls prayed piteously to Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a for their deliverance, and the merciful Lord, called by their fervent prayer, released them all by fighting and killing Bhaum&#257;sura. All these captive princesses were then accepted by the Lord as His wives, although in the estimation of society they were all fallen girls. The all-powerful Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a accepted the humble prayers of these girls and married them with the adoration of queens. So altogether Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a had 16,108 queens at Dv&#257;rak&#257;, and in each of them He begot ten children. All these children grew up, and each had as many children as the father. The aggregate of the family numbered 10,000,000.</div>

<div class="First">The devotees of the Lord are purified souls. As soon as the devotees surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord sincerely, the Lord accepts them, and thus the devotees at once become free from all material contaminations. Such devotees are above the three modes of material nature. There is no bodily disqualification of a devotee, just as there is no qualitative difference between the Ganges water and the filthy drain water when they are amalgamated. Women, merchants and laborers are not very intelligent, and thus it is very difficult for them to understand the science of God or to be engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. They are more materialistic, and less than them are the Kir&#257;tas, H&#363;&#7751;as, &#256;ndhras, Pulindas, Pulka&#347;as, &#256;bh&#299;ras, Ka&#7749;kas, Yavanas, Khasas, etc., but all of them can be delivered if they are properly engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. By engagement in the service of the Lord, the designative disqualifications are removed, and as pure souls they become eligible to enter into the kingdom of God.</div>
<div class="Purport">The fallen girls under the clutches of Bhaum&#257;sura sincerely prayed to Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a for their deliverance, and their sincerity of purpose made them at once pure by virtue of devotion. The Lord therefore accepted them as His wives, and thus their lives became glorified. Such auspicious glorification was still more glorified when the Lord played with them as the most devoted husband.</div>
<div class="Purport">The Lord used to live with His 16,108 wives constantly. He expanded Himself into 16,108 plenary portions, and each and every one of them was the Lord Himself without deviation from the Original Personality. The <span class="Italic">&#346;ruti-mantra</span> affirms that the Lord can expand Himself into many. As husband of so many wives, He pleased them all with presentations, even at a costly endeavor. He brought the <span class="Italic">p&#257;rij&#257;ta</span> plant from heaven and implanted it at the palace of Satyabh&#257;m&#257;, one of the principal queens. If, therefore, anyone desires the Lord to become one's husband, the Lord fulfills such desires in full.</div>

<div class="First">Natural defensive measures are horses and elephants combined with chariots and men. Horses and elephants are trained to move to any part of the hills or forests and plains. The charioteers could fight with many horses and elephants by the strength of powerful arrows, even up to the standard of the <span class="Italic">brahm&#257;stra</span> (similar to modern atomic weapons). Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira knew well that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is everyone's friend and well-wisher, and yet there were <span class="Italic">asuras</span> who were by nature envious of the Lord. So out of fear of attack from others and out of affection also, he engaged all varieties of defensive forces as bodyguards of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. If required, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself was sufficient to defend Himself from the attack of others who counted the Lord as their enemy, but still He accepted all the arrangements made by Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira because He could not disobey the King, who was His elder cousin. The Lord plays the part of a subordinate in His transcendental sporting, and thus sometimes He puts Himself in the care of Ya&#347;od&#257;m&#257;t&#257; for His protection in His so-called helplessness of childhood. That is the transcendental <span class="Italic">l&#299;l&#257;,</span> or pastime of the Lord. The basic principle for all transcendental exchanges between the Lord and His devotees is exhibited to enjoy a transcendental bliss for which there is no comparison, even up to the level of <span class="Italic">brahm&#257;nanda.</span></div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">It is said here that the Lord observed the religious principles regularly while He was on the journey. There are certain philosophical speculations that even the Lord is under the obligations of fruitive action. But actually this is not the case. He does not depend on the action of any good or bad work. <span class="Italic">Since the Lord is absolute, everything done by Him is good for everyone.</span> But when He descends on earth, He acts for the protection of the devotees and for the annihilation of the impious nondevotees. Although He has no obligatory duty, still He does everything so that others may follow. That is the way of factual teaching; one must act properly himself and teach the same to others, otherwise no one will accept one's blind teaching. He is Himself the awarder of fruitive results. He is self-sufficient, and yet He acts according to the rulings of the revealed scripture in order to teach us the process. If He does not do so, the common man may go wrong. But in the advanced stage, when one can understand the transcendental nature of the Lord, one does not try to imitate Him. This is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purport">The Lord in human society does what is the duty of everyone, but sometimes He does something extraordinary and not to be imitated by the living being. His acts of evening prayer as stated herein must be followed by the living being, but it is not possible to follow His mountain-lifting or dancing with the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s.</span> One cannot imitate the sun, which can exhaust water even from a filthy place; the most powerful can do something which is all-good, but our imitation of such acts will put us into endless difficulty. Therefore, in all actions, the experienced guide, the spiritual master, who is the manifested mercy of the Lord, should always be consulted, and the path of progress will be assured.</div>

Such associates of the Lord are eternally liberated souls, and they cannot bear the separation of the Lord even for a moment because of intense affection for the Lord. Thus the inhabitants of the city of Dv&#257;rak&#257; were in a mood of dejection and expected the arrival of the Lord at any moment. So the heralding sound of the auspicious conchshell was very encouraging, and apparently the sound pacified their dejection.

<div class="Translation">The citizens of Dv&#257;rak&#257;, having heard that sound which threatens fear personified in the material world, began to run towards Him fast, just to have a long desired audience with the Lord, who is the protector of all devotees.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">As already explained, the citizens of Dv&#257;rak&#257; who lived at the time of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's presence there were all liberated souls who descended there along with the Lord as entourage. All were very anxious to have an audience with the Lord, although because of spiritual contact they were never separated from the Lord. Just as the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> at V&#7771;nd&#257;vana used to think of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a while He was away from the village for cowherding engagements, the citizens of Dv&#257;rak&#257; were all immersed in thought of the Lord while He was away from Dv&#257;rak&#257; to attend the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra. Some distinguished fiction writer in Bengal concluded that the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, that of Mathur&#257; and that of Dv&#257;rak&#257; were different personalities. Historically there is no truth in this conclusion. The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a of Kuruk&#7779;etra and the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a of Dv&#257;rak&#257; are one and the same personality.</div>
<div class="Purport">The citizens of Dv&#257;rak&#257; were thus in a state of melancholy due to the Lord's absence from the transcendental city, as much as we are put in a state of melancholy at night because of the absence of the sun. The sound heralded by Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was something like the heralding of the sunrise in the morning. So all the citizens of Dv&#257;rak&#257; awoke from a state of slumber because of the sunrise of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and they all hastened towards Him just to have an audience. The devotees of the Lord know no one else as protector.</div>
<div class="Purport">This sound of the Lord is identical with the Lord, as we have tried to explain by the nondual position of the Lord. The material existence of our present status is full of fear. Out of the four problems of material existence, namely the food problem, the shelter problem, the fear problem and the mating problem, the fear problem gives us more trouble than the others. We are always fearful due to our ignorance of the next problem. The whole material existence is full of problems, and thus the fear problem is always prominent. This is due to our association with the illusory energy of the Lord, known as <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> or external energy, yet all fear is vanished as soon as there is the sound of the Lord, represented by His holy name, as it was sounded by Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu in the following sixteen words:</div>

<div class="Translation">The citizens arrived before the Lord with their respective presentations, offering them to the fully satisfied and self-sufficient one, who, by His own potency, incessantly supplies others. These presentations were like the offering of a lamp to the sun. Yet the citizens began to speak in ecstatic language to receive the Lord, just as wards welcome their guardian and father.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Supreme Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is described herein as <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;r&#257;ma.</span> He is self-sufficient, and there is no need for Him to seek happiness from anything beyond Himself. He is self-sufficient because His very transcendental existence is total bliss. He is eternally existent; He is all-cognizant and all-blissful. Therefore, any presentation, however valuable it may be, is not needed by Him. But still, because He is the well-wisher for one and all, He accepts from everyone everything that is offered to Him in pure devotional service. It is not that He is in want for such things, because the things are themselves generated from His energy. The comparison is made herein that making offerings to the Lord is something like offering a lamp in the worship of the sun-god. Anything fiery and illuminating is but an emanation of the energy of the sun, and yet to worship the sun-god it is necessary to offer him a lamp. In the worship of the sun, there is some sort of demand made by the worshiper, but in the case of devotional service to the Lord, there is no question of demand from either side. It is all a sign of pure love and affection between the Lord and the devotee.</div>
<div class="Purport">The Lord is the Supreme Father of all living beings, and therefore those who are conscious of this <span class="Italic">vital</span> relation with God can make filial demands from the Father, and the Father is pleased to supply the demands of such obedient sons without bargaining. The Lord is just like the <span class="Italic">desire tree,</span> and from Him everyone can have everything by the causeless mercy of the Lord. As the Supreme Father, the Lord, however, does not supply to a pure devotee what is considered to be a barrier to the discharge of devotional service. Those who are engaged in the devotional service of the Lord can rise to the position of unalloyed devotional service by His transcendental attraction.</div>

As soon as we forget this clear fact, we are at once in illusion, and thus we are put into threefold miseries, as one is put into dense darkness. The clear consciousness of the cognizant living being is God consciousness, in which one bows down unto Him in all circumstances.</div>

<div class="First">The all-good Personality of Godhead, being the creator of the universe, also plans for the good of all good living beings. The good living beings are advised by the Lord to follow His good advice, and by doing so they become successful in all spheres of life. There is no need to worship any deity but the Lord. The Lord is all-powerful, and if He is satisfied by our obedience unto His lotus feet, He is competent to bestow upon us all kinds of blessings for the successful execution of both our material and spiritual lives. For attaining spiritual existence, the human form is a chance for all to understand our eternal relation with God. Our relation with Him is eternal; it can neither be broken nor vanquished. It may be forgotten for the time being, but it can be revived also by the grace of the Lord, if we follow His injunctions, which are revealed in the scriptures of all times and all places.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Lord in His eternal personal form can be seen only by the pure devotees. The Lord is never impersonal, but He is the Supreme Absolute Personality of Godhead, possible to be visited by devotional service face to face, which is impossible to be done even by the denizens of higher planets. When Brahm&#257;j&#299; and other demigods want to consult Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the plenary portion of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, they have to wait on the shore of the ocean of milk where Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is lying on White Land (&#346;vetadv&#299;pa). This ocean of milk and the &#346;vetadv&#299;pa planet are the replica of Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka within the universe. Neither Brahm&#257;j&#299; nor the demigods like Indra can enter into this island of &#346;vetadv&#299;pa, but they can stand on the shore of the ocean of milk and transmit their message to Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, known as K&#7779;&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Therefore, the Lord is rarely seen by them, but the inhabitants of Dv&#257;rak&#257;, because of their being pure devotees without any tinge of the material contamination of fruitive activities and empiric philosophical speculation, can see Him face to face by the grace of the Lord. This is the original state of the living entities and can be attained by reviving our natural and constitutional state of life, which is discovered by devotional service only.</div>

Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, being the primeval Lord, the Supreme Truth, is compared to the sun. Without Him all our knowledge is either false or partial. The opposite of the sun is the darkness, and similarly the opposite of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> or illusion. The devotees of the Lord can see everything in true perspective due to the light disseminated by Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. By the grace of the Lord the pure devotee cannot be in the darkness of ignorance. Therefore, it is necessary that we must always be in the sight of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a so that we can see both ourselves and the Lord with His different energies. As we cannot see anything in the absence of the sun, so also we cannot see anything including our own self, without the factual presence of the Lord.

Because we are all eternally related with Him as the sun rays are eternally related with the sun disc. The sun rays are molecular parts of the solar radiation. Thus the sun rays and the sun cannot be separated. The separation by the cloud is temporary and artificial, and as soon as the cloud is cleared, the sun rays again display their natural effulgence in the presence of the sun. Similarly, the living entities, who are molecular parts of the whole spirit, are separated from the Lord by the artificial covering of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> illusory energy. This illusory energy, or the curtain of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> has to be removed, and when it is so done, the living entity can see the Lord face to face, and all his miseries are at once removed.

<div class="Translation">The city of Dv&#257;rak&#257;pur&#299; was filled with the opulences of all seasons. There were hermitages, orchards, flower gardens, parks and reservoirs of water breeding lotus flowers all over.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Perfection of human civilization is made possible by utilizing the gifts of nature in their own way. As we find herewith in the description of its opulence, Dv&#257;rak&#257; was surrounded by flower gardens and fruit orchards along with reservoirs of water and growing lotuses. There is no mention of mills and factories supported by slaughterhouses, which are the necessary paraphernalia of the modern metropolis. The propensity to utilize nature's own gifts is still there, even in the heart of modern civilized man. The leaders of modern civilization select their own residential quarters in a place where there are such naturally beautiful gardens and reservoirs of water, but they leave the common men to reside in congested areas without parks and gardens. Herein of course we find a different description of the city of Dv&#257;rak&#257;. It is understood that the whole <span class="Italic">dh&#257;ma,</span> or residential quarter, was surrounded by such gardens and parks with reservoirs of water where lotuses grew. It is understood that all the people depended on nature's gifts of fruits and flowers without industrial enterprises promoting filthy huts and slums for residential quarters. Advancement of civilization is estimated not on the growth of mills and factories to deteriorate the finer instincts of the human being, but on developing the potent spiritual instincts of human beings and giving them a chance to go back to Godhead. Development of factories and mills is called <span class="Italic">ugra-karma,</span> or pungent activities, and such activities deteriorate the finer sentiments of the human being and society to form a dungeon of demons.</div>
<div class="Purport">We find herein the mention of pious trees which produce seasonal flowers and fruits. The impious trees are useless jungles only, and they can only be used to supply fuels. In the modern civilization such impious trees are planted on the sides of roads. Human energy should be properly utilized in developing the finer senses for spiritual understanding, in which lies the solution of life. Fruits, flowers, beautiful gardens, parks and reservoirs of water with ducks and swans playing in the midst of lotus flowers, and cows giving sufficient milk and butter are essential for developing the finer tissues of the human body. As against this, the dungeons of mines, factories and workshops develop demoniac propensities in the working class. The vested interests flourish at the cost of the working class, and consequently there are severe clashes between them in so many ways. The description of Dv&#257;rak&#257;-dh&#257;ma is the ideal of human civilization.</div>

<div class="First">Signs of decoration in special festivals were also collected from the gifts of nature, such as the plantain trees, the mango trees, fruits and flowers. Mango trees, coconut palms and plantain trees are still accepted as auspicious signs. The flags mentioned above were all painted with the picture of either Garu&#7693;a or Hanum&#257;n, the two great servitors of the Lord. For devotees, such paintings and decorations are still adored, and the servitor of the master is paid more respects for the satisfaction of the Lord.</div>

And to welcome the Lord such flowers and fruits with unbroken seeds of grain were also strewn over the public places. Unbroken seeds of grain or fruits in the seedling stage were considered auspicious, and they are still so used by the Hindus in general on festival days.</div>

<div class="First">The process of reception according to Vedic rites is not at all dry. The reception was made not simply by decorating the roads and streets as above mentioned, but by worshiping the Lord with requisite ingredients like incense, lamps, flowers, sweets, fruits and other palatable eatables, according to one's capacity. All were offered to the Lord, and the remnants of the foodstuff were distributed amongst the gathering citizens. So it was not like a dry reception of these modern days. Each and every house was ready to receive the Lord in a similar way, and thus each and every house on the roads and streets distributed such remnants of food to the citizens, and therefore the festival was successful. Without distribution of food, no function is complete, and that is the way of Vedic culture.</div>

<div class="Translation">On hearing that the most dear K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was approaching Dv&#257;rak&#257;dh&#257;ma, magnanimous Vasudeva, Akr&#363;ra, Ugrasena, Balar&#257;ma (the superhumanly powerful), Pradyumna, C&#257;rude&#7779;&#7751;a and S&#257;mba the son of J&#257;mbavat&#299;, all extremely happy, abandoned resting, sitting and dining.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"><span class="Italic">Vasudeva:</span> Son of King &#346;&#363;rasena, husband of Devak&#299; and father of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. He is the brother of Kunt&#299; and father of Subhadr&#257;. Subhadr&#257; was married with her cousin Arjuna, and this system is still prevalent in some parts of India. Vasudeva was appointed minister of Ugrasena, and later on he married eight daughters of Ugrasena's brother Devaka. Devak&#299; is only one of them. Ka&#7745;sa was his brother-in-law, and Vasudeva accepted voluntary imprisonment by Ka&#7745;sa on mutual agreement to deliver the eighth son of Devak&#299;. This was foiled by the will of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. As maternal uncle of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, he took active parts in the purificatory process of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas. He sent for the priest Ka&#347;yapa at the &#346;atas&#7771;&#7749;ga Parvata, and he executed the functions. When K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appeared within the bars of Ka&#7745;sa's prison house, He was transferred by Vasudeva to the house of Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, the foster father of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, at Gokula. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a disappeared along with Baladeva prior to the disappearance of Vasudeva, and Arjuna (Vasudeva's nephew) undertook the charge of the funeral ceremony after Vasudeva's disappearance.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Akr&#363;ra:</span> The commander in chief of the V&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;i dynasty and a great devotee of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Akr&#363;ra attained success in devotional service to the Lord by the one single process of offering prayers. He was the husband of S&#363;tan&#299;, daughter of Ah&#363;ka. He supported Arjuna when Arjuna took Subhadr&#257; forcibly away by the will of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Both K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and Akr&#363;ra went to see Arjuna after his successful kidnapping of Subhadr&#257;. Both of them presented dowries to Arjuna after this incidence. Akr&#363;ra was present also when Abhimanyu, the son of Subhadr&#257;, was married with Uttar&#257;, mother of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it. Ah&#363;ka, the father-in-law of Akr&#363;ra, was not on good terms with Akr&#363;ra. But both of them were devotees of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Ugrasena:</span> One of the powerful kings of the V&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;i dynasty and cousin of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Kuntibhoja. His other name is Ah&#363;ka. His minister was Vasudeva, and his son was the powerful Ka&#7745;sa. This Ka&#7745;sa imprisoned his father and became the King of Mathur&#257;. By the grace of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and His brother, Lord Baladeva, Ka&#7745;sa was killed, and Ugrasena was reinstalled on the throne. When &#346;&#257;lva attacked the city of Dv&#257;rak&#257;, Ugrasena fought very valiantly and repulsed the enemy. Ugrasena inquired from N&#257;radaj&#299; about the divinity of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. When the Yadu dynasty was to be vanquished, Ugrasena was entrusted with the iron lump produced from the womb of S&#257;mba. He cut the iron lump into pieces and then pasted it and mixed it up with the sea water on the coast of Dv&#257;rak&#257;. After this, he ordered complete prohibition within the city of Dv&#257;rak&#257; and the kingdom. He got salvation after his death.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Baladeva:</span> He is the divine son of Vasudeva by his wife Rohi&#7751;&#299;. He is also known as Rohi&#7751;&#299;-nandana, the beloved son of Rohi&#7751;&#299;. He was also entrusted to Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja along with His mother, Rohi&#7751;&#299;, when Vasudeva embraced imprisonment by mutual agreement with Ka&#7745;sa. So Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja is also the foster father of Baladeva along with Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and Lord Baladeva were constant companions from Their very childhood, although They were stepbrothers. He is the plenary manifestation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore He is as good and powerful as Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. He belongs to the <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-tattva</span> (the principle of Godhead). He attended the <span class="Italic">svaya&#7745;vara</span> ceremony of Draupad&#299; along with &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. When Subhadr&#257; was kidnapped by Arjuna by the organized plan of &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Baladeva was very angry with Arjuna and wanted to kill him at once. &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, for the sake of His dear friend, fell at the feet of Lord Baladeva and implored Him not to be so angry. &#346;r&#299; Baladeva was thus satisfied. Similarly, He was once very angry with the Kauravas, and He wanted to throw their whole city into the depths of the Yamun&#257;. But the Kauravas satisfied Him by surrendering unto His divine lotus feet. He was actually the seventh son of Devak&#299; prior to the birth of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, but by the will of the Lord He was transferred to the womb of Rohi&#7751;&#299; to escape the wrath of Ka&#7745;sa. His other name is therefore Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a, who is also the plenary portion of &#346;r&#299; Baladeva. Because He is as powerful as Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and can bestow spiritual power to the devotees, He is therefore known as Baladeva. In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> also it is enjoined that no one can know the Supreme Lord without being favored by Baladeva. <span class="Italic">Bala</span> means spiritual strength not physical. Some less intelligent persons interpret <span class="Italic">bala</span> as the strength of the body. But no one can have spiritual realization by physical strength. Physical strength ends with the end of the physical body, but spiritual strength follows the spirit soul to the next transmigration, and therefore the strength obtained by Baladeva is never wasted. The strength is eternal, and thus Baladeva is the original spiritual master of all devotees.</div>
<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299; Baladeva was also a class friend of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as a student of S&#257;nd&#299;pani Muni. In His childhood He killed many <span class="Italic">asuras</span> along with &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and specifically He killed the Dhenuk&#257;sura at T&#257;lavana. During the Kuruk&#7779;etra battle, He remained neutral, and He tried His best not to bring about the fight. He was in favor of Duryodhana, but still He remained neutral. When there was a club-fight between Duryodhana and Bh&#299;masena, He was present on the spot. He was angry at Bh&#299;masena when the latter struck Duryodhana on the thigh or below the belt, and He wanted to retaliate the unfair action. Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a saved Bh&#299;ma from His wrath. But He left the place at once, being disgusted at Bh&#299;masena, and after His departure Duryodhana fell to the ground to meet his death. The funeral ceremony of Abhimanyu, the son of Arjuna, was performed by Him, as He was the maternal uncle. It was impossible to be performed by any one of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, who were all overwhelmed with grief. At the last stage, He departed from this world by producing a great white snake from His mouth, and thus He was carried by &#346;e&#7779;an&#257;ga in the shape of a serpent.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Pradyumna:</span> Incarnation of K&#257;madeva or, according to others, incarnation of Sanat-kum&#257;ra, born as the son of the Personality of Godhead Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and Lak&#7779;m&#299;dev&#299; &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; Rukmi&#7751;&#299;, the principal queen at Dv&#257;rak&#257;. He was one of those who went to congratulate Arjuna upon his marrying Subhadr&#257;. He was one of the great generals who fought with &#346;&#257;lva, and while fighting with him he became unconscious on the battlefield. His charioteer brought him back to the camp from the battlefield, and for this action he was very sorry and rebuked his charioteer. However, he fought again with &#346;&#257;lva and was victorious. He heard all about the different demigods from N&#257;radaj&#299;. He is one of the four plenary expansions of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. He is the third one. He inquired from his father, &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, about the glories of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> During the fratricidal war amongst the descendants of Yadu, he died at the hand of Bhoja, another king of the V&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;is.

He was also present during the <span class="Italic">svaya&#7745;vara</span> ceremony of Draupad&#299;. He was a great warrior like his brothers and father. He fought with Vivinidhaka and killed him in the fight.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">S&#257;mba:</span> One of the great heroes of the Yadu dynasty and the son of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a by His wife J&#257;mbavat&#299;. He learned the military art of throwing arrows from Arjuna, and he became a member of parliament during the time of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira. He was present during the R&#257;jas&#363;ya-yaj&ntilde;a of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira. When all the V&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;is were assembled during the time of Prava&#347;a-yaj&ntilde;a, his glorious activities were narrated by S&#257;tyaki before Lord Baladeva. He was also present along with his father, Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, during the A&#347;vamedha-yaj&ntilde;a performed by Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira. He was presented before some <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is</span> falsely dressed as a pregnant woman by his brothers, and in fun he asked the <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is</span> what he was going to deliver. The <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is</span> replied that he would deliver a lump of iron, which would be the cause of fratricidal war in the family of Yadu. The next day, in the morning, S&#257;mba delivered a large lump of iron, which was entrusted with Ugrasena for necessary action. Actually later on there was the foretold fratricidal war, and S&#257;mba died in that war.</div>
<div class="Purport">So all these sons of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a left their respective palaces and leaving aside all engagements, including lying down, sitting and dining, hastened toward their exalted father.</div>

<div class="Translation">At the same time, many hundreds of well-known prostitutes began to proceed on various vehicles. They were all very eager to meet the Lord, and their beautiful faces were decorated with dazzling earrings, which enhanced the beauty of their foreheads.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">We may not hate even the prostitutes if they are devotees of the Lord. Even to date there are many prostitutes in great cities of India who are sincere devotees of the Lord. By tricks of chance one may be obliged to adopt a profession which is not very adorable in society, but that does not hamper one in executing devotional service to the Lord. Devotional service to the Lord is uncheckable in all circumstances. It is understood herewith that even in those days, about five thousand years ago, there were prostitutes in a city like Dv&#257;rak&#257;, where Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a resided. This means that prostitutes are necessary citizens for the proper upkeep of society. The government opens wine shops, but this does not mean that the government encourages the drinking of wine. The idea is that there is a class of men who will drink at any cost, and it has been experienced that prohibition in great cities encouraged illicit smuggling of wine. Similarly, men who are not satisfied at home require such concessions, and if there is no prostitute, then such low men will induce others into prostitution. It is better that prostitutes be available in the marketplace so that the sanctity of society can be maintained. It is better to maintain a class of prostitutes than to encourage prostitutes within society. The real reformation is to enlighten all people to become devotees of the Lord, and that will check all kinds of deteriorating factors of life.</div>
<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299; Bilvama&#7749;gala &#7788;h&#257;kura, a great <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya</span> of the Vi&#7779;&#7751;usv&#257;m&#299; Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava sect, in his householder life was overly attached to a prostitute who happened to be a devotee of the Lord. One night when the &#7788;h&#257;kura came to Cint&#257;ma&#7751;i's house in torrents of rain and thunder, Cint&#257;ma&#7751;i was astonished to see how the &#7788;h&#257;kura could come on such a dreadful night after crossing a foaming river which was full of waves. She said to &#7788;h&#257;kura Bilvama&#7749;gala that his attraction for the flesh and bone of an insignificant woman like her would be properly utilized if it could be diverted to the devotional service of the Lord to achieve attraction for the transcendental beauty of the Lord. It was a momentous hour for the &#7788;h&#257;kura, and he took a turn towards spiritual realization by the words of a prostitute. Later on the &#7788;h&#257;kura accepted the prostitute as his spiritual master, and in several places of his literary works he has glorified the name of Cint&#257;ma&#7751;i, who showed him the right path.</div>
<div class="Purport">In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index27a1.html?g=3273">9.32</a>) the Lord says, "O son of P&#7771;th&#257;, even the low-born <span class="Italic">ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;las</span> and those who are born in a family of unbelievers, and even the prostitutes, shall attain perfection of life if they take shelter of unalloyed devotional service to Me, because in the path of devotional service there are no impediments due to degraded birth and occupation. The path is open for everyone who agrees to follow it."</div>
<div class="Purport">It appears that the prostitutes of Dv&#257;rak&#257;, who were so eager to meet the Lord, were all His unalloyed devotees, and thus they were all on the path of salvation according to the above version of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> Therefore, the only reformation that is necessary in society is to make an organized effort to turn the citizens into devotees of the Lord, and thus all good qualities of the denizens of heaven will overtake them in their own way. On the other hand, those who are nondevotees have no good qualifications whatsoever, however they may be materially advanced. The difference is that the devotees of the Lord are on the path of liberation, whereas the nondevotees are on the path of further entanglement in material bondage. The criterion of advancement of civilization is whether the people are educated and advanced on the path of salvation.</div>

<div class="First">It appears that five thousand years ago the society also needed the services of the dramatists, artists, dancers, singers, historians, genealogists, public speakers, etc. Dancers, singers and dramatic artists mostly hailed from the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> community, whereas the learned historians, genealogists and public speakers hailed from the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> community. All of them belonged to a particular caste, and they became so trained in their respective families. Such dramatists, dancers, singers, historians, genealogists and public speakers would dwell on the subject of the Lord's superhuman activities in different ages and millenniums, and not on ordinary events. Nor were they in chronological order. All the <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> are historical facts described only in relation with the Supreme Lord in different ages and times as well as on different planets also. Therefore, we do not find any chronological order. The modern historians, therefore, cannot catch up the link, and thus they unauthoritatively remark that the <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> are all imaginary stories only.</div>
<div class="Purport">Even one hundred years ago in India, all dramatic performances were centered around the superhuman activities of the Supreme Lord. The common people would be verily entertained by the performances of dramas, and <span class="Italic">y&#257;tr&#257;</span> parties played wonderfully on the superhuman activities of the Lord, and thus even the illiterate agriculturist would be a participant in the knowledge of Vedic literature, despite a considerable lack of academic qualifications. Therefore, expert players in drama, dancers, singers, speakers, etc., are required for the spiritual enlightenment of the common man. The genealogists would give account completely of the descendants of a particular family. Even at the present moment the guides in the pilgrimage sites of India submit a complete account of genealogical tables before a newcomer. This wonderful act sometimes attracts more customers to receive such important information.</div>

<div class="Translation">When Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a passed over the public roads, all the ladies from the respectable families of Dv&#257;rak&#257; went up to the roofs of their palaces just to have a look at the Lord. They considered this to be the greatest festival.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">To have a look at the Lord is a great festive occasion undoubtedly, as it was considered by the metropolitan ladies of Dv&#257;rak&#257;. This is still followed by the devout ladies of India. Especially during the days of the Jhulana and Janm&#257;&#7779;&#7789;am&#299; ceremonies, the ladies of India still throng up in the greatest number at the temple of the Lord, where His transcendental eternal form is worshiped. The transcendental form of the Lord installed in a temple is not different from the Lord personally. Such a form of the Lord is called <span class="Italic">arca-vigraha,</span> or <span class="Italic">arc&#257;</span> incarnation, and is expanded by the Lord by His internal potency just to facilitate the devotional service of His innumerable devotees who are in the material world. The material senses cannot perceive the spiritual nature of the Lord, and therefore the Lord accepts the <span class="Italic">arca-vigraha,</span> which is apparently made of material elements like earth, wood and stone but actually there is no material contamination. The Lord being <span class="Italic">kaivalya</span> (one alone), there is no matter in Him. He is one without a second, and therefore the Almighty Lord can appear in any form without being contaminated by the material conception. Therefore, festivities in the temple of the Lord, as held generally, are like festivals performed during the manifestive days of the Lord of Dv&#257;rak&#257;, about five thousand years ago. The authorized <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas,</span> who know the science perfectly, install such temples of the Lord under regulative principles just to offer facilities to the common man, but persons who are less intelligent, without being conversant with the science, mistake this great attempt to be <span class="Italic">idol worship</span> and poke their nose into that to which they have no access. Therefore, the ladies or men who observe festivals in the temples of the Lord just to have a look at the transcendental form are a thousand times more glorious than those who are nonbelievers in the transcendental form of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purport">It appears from the verse that the inhabitants of Dv&#257;rak&#257; were all owners of big palaces. This indicates the prosperity of the city. The ladies got up on the roofs just to have a look at the procession and the Lord. The ladies did not mix with the crowd on the street, and thus their respectability was perfectly observed. There was no artificial equality with the man. Female respectability is preserved more elegantly by keeping the woman separate from the man. The sexes should not mix unrestrictedly.</div>

<div class="Translation">The inhabitants of Dv&#257;rak&#257; were regularly accustomed to look upon the reservoir of all beauty, the infallible Lord, yet they were never satiated.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">When the ladies of the city of Dv&#257;rak&#257; got up on the roofs of their palaces, they never thought that they had previously many times seen the beautiful body of the infallible Lord. This indicates that they had no satiation in desiring to see the Lord. Anything material seen for a number of times ultimately becomes unattractive by the law of satiation. The law of satiation acts materially, but there is no scope for it in the spiritual realm. The word infallible is significant here, because although the Lord has mercifully descended on earth, He is still infallible. The living entities are fallible because when they come in contact with the material world they lack their spiritual identity, and thus the body materially obtained becomes subjected to birth, growth, transformation, situation, deterioration and annihilation under the laws of nature. The Lord's body is not like that. He descends as He is and is never under the laws of the material modes. His body is the source of everything that be, the reservoir of all beauties beyond our experience. No one, therefore, is satiated by seeing the transcendental body of the Lord because there are always manifestations of newer and newer beauties. The transcendental name, form, qualities, entourage, etc., are all spiritual manifestations, and there is no satiation in chanting the holy name of the Lord, there is no satiation in discussing the qualities of the Lord, and there is no limitation of the entourage of the Lord. He is the source of all and is limitless.</div>

<div class="First">There are different classes of human beings, all seeking different enjoyments from different objects. There are persons who are seeking after the favor of the goddess of fortune, and for them the Vedic literatures give information that the Lord is always served with all reverence by thousands and thousands of goddesses of fortune at the <span class="Italic">cint&#257;ma&#7751;i-dh&#257;ma,</span><PW:Popup,3.64514,2.3125,Popup><div class="Verse-in-purp">cint&#257;ma&#7751;i-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-v&#7771;k&#7779;a-<br>lak&#7779;&#257;v&#7771;te&#7779;u surabh&#299;r abhip&#257;layantam<br>lak&#7779;m&#299;-sahasra-&#347;ata-sambhrama-sevyam&#257;na&#7745;<br>govindam &#257;di-puru&#7779;a&#7745; tam aha&#7745; bhaj&#257;mi</div></div>
<div class="VerseRef">(Bs. 5.29)<LT>* the transcendental abode of the Lord where the trees are all desire trees and the buildings are made of touchstone. The Lord Govinda is engaged there in herding the <span class="Italic">surabhi</span> cows as His natural occupation. These goddesses of fortune can be seen automatically if we are attracted by the bodily features of the Lord. The impersonalists cannot observe such goddesses of fortune because of their dry speculative habit. And those who are artists, overtaken by the beautiful creation, should better see to the beautiful face of the Lord for complete satisfaction. The face of the Lord is the embodiment of beauty. What they call beautiful nature is but His smile, and what they call the sweet songs of the birds are but specimens of the whispering voice of the Lord. There are administrative demigods in charge of departmental service of cosmic management, and there are tiny administrative gods in the state service. They are always afraid of other competitors, but if they take shelter of the arms of the Lord, the Lord can protect them always from the attacks of enemies. A faithful servant of the Lord engaged in the service of administration is the ideal executive head and can well protect the interest of the people in general. Other so-called administrators are symbols of anachronisms leading to the acute distress of the people who are governed by them. The administrators can remain safely under the protection of the arms of the Lord. The essence of everything is the Supreme Lord: He is called the <span class="Italic">s&#257;ram.</span> And those who sing and talk about Him are called the <span class="Italic">s&#257;ra&#7749;gas,</span> or the pure devotees. The pure devotees are always hankering after the lotus feet of the Lord. The lotus has a kind of honey which is transcendentally relished by the devotees. They are like the bees who are always after the honey. &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299;, the great devotee <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya</span> of the Gau&#7693;&#299;ya-Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-samprad&#257;ya, has sung a song about this lotus honey, comparing himself to the bee: "O my Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, I beg to offer my prayers unto You. My mind is like the bee, and it is after some honey. Kindly, therefore, give my bee-mind a place at Your lotus feet, which are the resources for all transcendental honey. I know that even big demigods like Brahm&#257; do not see the rays of the nails of Your lotus feet, even though they are engaged in deep meditation for years together. Still, O infallible one, my ambition is such, for You are very merciful to your surrendered devotees. O M&#257;dhava, I know also that I have no genuine devotion for the service of Your lotus feet, but because Your Lordship is inconceivably powerful, You can do what is impossible to be done. Your lotus feet can deride even the nectar of the heavenly kingdom, and therefore I am very much attracted by them. O supreme eternal, please, therefore, let my mind be fixed at Your lotus feet so that eternally I may be able to relish the taste of Your transcendental service." The devotees are satisfied with being placed at the lotus feet of the Lord and have no ambition to see His all-beautiful face or aspire for the protection of the strong arms of the Lord. They are humble by nature, and the Lord is always leaning towards such humble devotees.</div>

<div class="First">The sun, moon, rainbow and lightning do not appear in the sky simultaneously. When there is sun, the moonlight becomes insignificant, and if there are clouds and a rainbow, there is no manifestation of lightning. The Lord's bodily hue is just like a new monsoon cloud.

The showers of flowers are compared to the stars. His yellow garments are compared to the rainbow. So all these activities of the firmament, being impossible simultaneous factors, cannot be adjusted by comparison. The adjustment is possible only when we think of the inconceivable potency of the Lord. The Lord is all-powerful, and in His presence anything impossible can be made possible by His inconceivable energy. But the situation created at the time of His passing on the roads of Dv&#257;rak&#257; was beautiful and could not be compared to anything besides the description of natural phenomena.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">The queens of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a rejoiced within their minds to see their husband home after a long period abroad. The queens got up at once from their seats and meditations. As was socially customary, they covered their faces shyly and looked about coyly.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">As mentioned above, the Lord entered His home palaces occupied by 16,108 queens. This means that the Lord at once expanded Himself in as many plenary expansions as there were queens and palaces and entered in each and every one of them simultaneously and separately. Here is another manifestation of the feature of His internal potency. He can expand Himself in as many forms of spiritual identity as He desires, even though He is one without a second. It is confirmed by the <span class="Italic">&#346;ruti-mantra</span> that the Absolute is one alone, and yet He becomes many as soon as He so desires. These manifold expansions of the Supreme Lord are manifested as plenary and separated portions. The separated portions are representations of His energy, and the plenary portions are manifestations of His Personality. Thus the Personality of Godhead manifested Himself in 16,108 plenary expansions and simultaneously entered into each and every one of the palaces of the queens. This is called <span class="Italic">vaibhava,</span> or the transcendental potency of the Lord. And because He can do so, He is also known as Yoge&#347;vara. Ordinarily, a <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> or mystic living being is able to expand himself at utmost to tenfold expansions of his body, but the Lord can do so to the extent of as many thousands or infinitely, as He likes. Unbelievers become astonished to learn that Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a married more than 16,000 queens because they think of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as one of them and measure the potency of the Lord by their own limited potency. One should know, therefore, that the Lord is never on the level of the living beings, who are but expansions of His marginal potency, and one should never equalize the potent and the potency, although there is very little difference of quality between the potent and the potency. The queens were also expansions of His internal potency, and thus the potent and potencies are perpetually exchanging transcendental pleasures, known as pastimes of the Lord. One should not, therefore, become astonished to learn that the Lord married so many wives. On the contrary, one should affirm that even if the Lord marries sixteen thousand million wives, He is not completely manifesting His unlimited and inexhaustible potency. He married <span class="Italic">only</span> 16,000 wives and entered in each and every one of the different palaces just to impress in the history of the human beings on the surface of the earth that the Lord is never equal to or less than any human being, however powerful he may be. No one, therefore, is either equal to or greater than the Lord. The Lord is always great in all respects. "God is great" is eternal truth.</div>
<div class="Purport">Therefore, as soon as the queens saw from a distance their husband, who was away from home for long periods due to the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra, they all arose from the slumber of meditation and prepared to receive their most beloved. According to Y&#257;j&ntilde;avalkya's religious injunctions, a woman whose husband is away from home should not take part in any social functions, should not decorate her body, should not laugh and should not go to any relative's house in any circumstance. This is the vow of the ladies whose husbands are away from home. At the same time, it is also enjoined that a wife should never present herself before the husband in an unclean state. She must decorate herself with ornaments and good dress and should always be present before the husband in a happy and joyous mood. The queens of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a were all in meditation, thinking of the Lord's absence, and were always meditating upon Him. The Lord's devotees cannot live for a moment without meditating on the Lord, and what to speak of the queens, who were all goddesses of fortune incarnated as queens in the pastimes of the Lord at Dv&#257;rak&#257;. They can never be separated from the Lord, either by presence or by trance. The <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> at V&#7771;nd&#257;vana could not forget the Lord when the Lord was away in the forest cow herding. When the Lord boy K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was absent from the village, the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> at home used to worry about Him traversing the rough ground with His soft lotus feet. By thinking thus, they were sometimes overwhelmed in trance and mortified in the heart. Such is the condition of the pure associates of the Lord. They are always in trance, and so the queens also were in trance during the absence of the Lord. Presently, having seen the Lord from a distance, they at once gave up all their engagements, including the vows of women as described above. According to &#346;r&#299; Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Carkavart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura, there was a regular psychological reaction on the occasion. First of all, rising from their seats, although they wanted to see their husband, they were deterred because of feminine shyness. But due to strong ecstasy, they overcame that stage of weakness and became caught up with the idea of embracing the Lord, and this thought factually made them unconscious of their surrounding environment. This prime state of ecstasy annihilated all other formalities and social conventions, and thus they escaped all stumbling blocks on the path of meeting the Lord. And that is the perfect stage of meeting the Lord of the soul, &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>

<div class="Translation">The insuperable ecstasy was so strong that the queens, who were shy, first embraced the Lord in the innermost recesses of their hearts.

But, O chief amongst the Bh&#7771;gus, though they tried to restrain their feelings, they inadvertently shed tears.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Although due to feminine shyness there were many hindrances to embracing the dear husband, Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the queens performed that act by seeing Him, by putting Him in the cores of their hearts, and by sending their sons to embrace Him. Still, the act remained unfinished, and tears rolled down their cheeks despite all endeavors to check them. One indirectly embraces the husband by sending the son to embrace him because the son is developed as part of the mother's body. The embrace of the son is not exactly the embrace of husband and wife from the sexual point of view, but the embrace is satisfaction from the affectionate point of view. The embrace of the eyes is more effective in the conjugal relation, and thus according to &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; there is nothing wrong in such an exchange of feeling between husband and wife.</div>

<div class="Translation">Although Lord Sri K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was constantly by their sides, as well as exclusively alone, His feet appeared to them to be newer and newer. The goddess of fortune, although by nature always restless and moving, could not quit the Lord's feet. So what woman can be detached from those feet, having once taken shelter of them?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Conditioned living beings are always after the favor of the goddess of fortune, although by nature she is moving from one place to another. In the material world no one is permanently fortunate, however clever one may be. There have been so many big empires in different parts of the world, there have been so many powerful kings all over the world, and there have been so many fortunate men, but all of them have been liquidated gradually. This is the law of material nature. But spiritually it is different. According to <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;,</span> the Lord is served very respectfully by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune. They are always in a lonely place also with the Lord. But still the association of the Lord is so inspiringly newer and newer that they cannot quit the Lord for a moment, even though they are by nature very restless and are moving about. The spiritual relation with the Lord is so enlivening and resourceful that no one can leave the company of the Lord, once having taken shelter of Him.</div>
<div class="Purport">The living beings are by constitution feminine by nature. The male or enjoyer is the Lord, and all manifestations of His different potencies are feminine by nature. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> the living beings are designated as <span class="Italic">par&#257;-prak&#7771;ti,</span> or the superior potency. The material elements are <span class="Italic">apar&#257;-prak&#7771;ti,</span> or inferior potency. Such potencies are always employed for the satisfaction of the employer, or the enjoyer. The supreme enjoyer is the Lord Himself, as stated in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index2ceb.html?g=2055">5.29</a>). The potencies, therefore, when engaged directly in the service of the Lord, revive the natural color, and thus there is no disparity in the relation of the potent and potency.</div>
<div class="Purport">Generally people engaged in service are always seeking some post under the government or the supreme enjoyer of the state. Since the Lord is the supreme enjoyer of everything in or outside the universe, it is happiness to be employed by Him. Once engaged in the supreme governmental service of the Lord, no living being wishes to be relieved from the engagement. The highest perfection of human life is to seek some employment under the Lord's supreme service. That will make one extremely happy. One need not seek the moving goddess of fortune without the relation of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">The Lord was pacified after killing those kings who were burdensome to the earth. They were puffed up with their military strength, their horses, elephants, chariots, infantry, etc. He Himself was not a party in the fight. He simply created hostility between the powerful administrators, and they fought amongst themselves. He was like the wind which causes friction between bamboos and so sparks a fire.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">As stated above, the living beings are not factual enjoyers of things which are manifested as God's creation. The Lord is the genuine proprietor and enjoyer of everything manifested in His creation. Unfortunately, influenced by the deluding energy, the living being becomes <span class="Italic">a false enjoyer</span> under the dictation of the modes of nature. Puffed up by such a false sense of becoming God, the deluded living being increases his material strength by so many activities and thus becomes the burden of the earth, so much so that the earth becomes completely uninhabitable by the sane. This state of affairs is called <span class="Italic">dharmasya gl&#257;&#7751;i,</span> or misuse of the energy of the human being. When such misuse of human energy is prominent, the saner living beings become perturbed by the awkward situation created by the vicious administrators, who are simply burdens of the earth, and the Lord appears by His internal potency just to save the saner section of humanity and to alleviate the burden due to the earthly administrators in different parts of the world. He does not favor either of the unwanted administrators, but by His potential power He creates hostility between such unwanted administrators, as the air creates fire in the forest by the friction of the bamboos. The fire in the forest takes place automatically by the force of the air, and similarly the hostility between different groups of politicians takes place by the unseen design of the Lord. The unwanted administrators, puffed up by false power and military strength, thus become engaged in fighting amongst themselves over ideological conflicts and so exhaust themselves of all powers. The history of the world reflects this factual will of the Lord, and it will continue to be enacted until the living beings are attached to the service of the Lord. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> this fact is very vividly described (Bg. <a href="indexd990.html?g=2586">7.14</a>). It is said, "The deluding energy is My potency, and thus it is not possible for the dependent living beings to supersede the strength of the material modes. But those who take shelter in Me [the Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a] can cross over the gigantic ocean of material energy." This means that no one can establish peace and prosperity in the world by fruitive activities or by speculative philosophy or ideology. The only way is to surrender unto the Supreme Lord and thus become free from the illusion of the deluding energy.</div>
<div class="Purport">Unfortunately persons who are engaged in destructive work are unable to surrender to the Personality of Godhead. They are all fools of the first order; they are the lowest of the human species of life; they are robbed of their knowledge, although apparently they seem to be academically educated. They are all of the demoniac mentality, always challenging the supreme power of the Lord. Those who are very materialistic, always hankering after material power and strength, are undoubtedly fools of the first order because they have no information of the living energy, and being ignorant of that supreme spiritual science, they are absorbed in material science, which ends with the end of the material body. They are the lowest of human beings because the human life is especially meant for reestablishing the lost relation with the Lord, and they miss this opportunity by being engaged in material activities. They are robbed of their knowledge because even after prolonged speculation they cannot reach to the stage of knowing the Personality of Godhead, the <span class="Italic">summum bonum</span> of everything. And all of them are men of demoniac principle, and they suffer the consequences, as did such materialistic heroes as R&#257;va&#7751;a, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, Ka&#7745;sa and others.</div>

<div class="Translation">That Supreme Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, out of His causeless mercy, appeared on this planet by His internal potency and enjoyed Himself amongst competent women as if He were engaging in mundane affairs.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Lord married and lived like a householder. This is certainly like a mundane affair, but when we learn that He married 16,108 wives and <span class="Italic">lived with them separately</span> in each and every palace, certainly it is not mundane. Therefore, the Lord, living as a householder amongst His competent wives, is never mundane, and His behavior with them is never to be understood as mundane sex relation. The women who became the wives of the Lord are certainly not ordinary women, because to get the Lord as one's husband is the result of many, many millions of births' <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> (austerity). When the Lord appears on different <span class="Italic">lokas,</span> or planets, or on this planet of human beings, He displays His transcendental pastimes just to attract the conditioned souls to become His eternal servitors, friends, parents and lovers respectively in the transcendental world, where the Lord eternally reciprocates such exchanges of service. Service is pervertedly represented in the material world and broken untimely, resulting in sad experience. The illusioned living being conditioned by material nature cannot understand out of ignorance that all our relations here in the mundane world are temporary and full of inebrieties. Such relations cannot help us be happy perpetually, but if the same relation is established with the Lord, then we are transferred to the transcendental world after leaving this material body and become eternally related with Him in the relation we desire. The women amongst whom He lived as their husband are not, therefore, women of this mundane world, but are eternally related with Him as transcendental wives, a position which they attained by perfection of devotional service. That is their competency. The Lord is <span class="Italic">para&#7745; brahma,</span> or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Conditioned souls seek after perpetual happiness in all places-not only on this earth but also on other planets throughout the universe-because constitutionally a spiritual spark, as he is, can travel to any part of God's creation. But being conditioned by the material modes, he tries to travel in space by spacecraft and so fails to reach his destination. The law of gravitation is binding upon him like the shackles of a prisoner. By other processes he can reach anywhere, but even if he reaches the highest planet, he cannot attain that perpetual happiness for which he is searching life after life. When he comes to his senses, however, he seeks after Brahman happiness, knowing it for certain that unlimited happiness, which he is seeking, is never attainable in the material world. As such, the Supreme Being, Parabrahman, certainly does not seek His happiness anywhere in the material world. Nor can His paraphernalia of happiness be found in the material world. He is not impersonal. Because He is the leader and Supreme Being amongst innumerable living beings, He cannot be impersonal. He is exactly like us, and He has all the propensities of an individual living being in fullness. He marries exactly like us, but His marriage is neither mundane nor limited by our experience in the conditioned state. His wives, therefore, appear like mundane women, but factually they are all transcendental liberated souls, perfect manifestations of internal energy.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Although the queens' beautiful smiles and furtive glances were all spotless and exciting, and although they could conquer Cupid himself by making him give up his bow in frustration, and although even the tolerant &#346;iva could fall victim to them, still, despite all their magical feats and attractions, they could not agitate the senses of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The path of salvation or the path going back to Godhead always forbids the association of women, and the complete <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana-dharma</span> or <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> scheme forbids or restricts association with women. How, then, can one be accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is addicted to more than sixteen thousand wives? This question may be relevantly raised by inquisitive persons really anxious to know about the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord. And to answer such questions, the sages at Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya have discussed the transcendental character of the Lord in this and in following verses. It is clear herein that the feminine attractive features which can conquer Cupid or even the supermost tolerant Lord &#346;iva could not conquer the senses of the Lord. Cupid's business is to invoke mundane lust. The whole universe is moving being agitated by Cupid's arrow. The activities of the world are being carried on by the central attraction of male and female. A male is searching after a mate to his liking, and the female is looking after a suitable male. That is the way of material stimulus. And as soon as a male is combined with a female, the material bondage of the living being is at once tightly interlocked by sex relation, and as a result of this, both the male's and female's attraction for sweet home, motherland, bodily offspring, society and friendship and accumulation of wealth becomes the illusory field of activities, and thus a false but indefatigable attraction for the temporary material existence, which is full of miseries, is manifest. Those who are, therefore, on the path of salvation for going back home back to Godhead, are especially advised by all scriptural instruction to become free from such paraphernalia of material attraction. And that is possible only by the association of the devotees of the Lord, who are called the <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;s.</span> Cupid throws his arrow upon the living beings to make them mad after the opposite sex, whether the party is actually beautiful or not. Cupid's provocations are going on, even among beastly societies who are all ugly-looking in the estimation of the civilized nations. Thus Cupid's influence is exerted even amongst the ugliest forms, and what to speak of the most perfect beauties. Lord &#346;iva, who is considered to be most tolerant, was also struck by Cupid's arrow because he also became mad after the <span class="Italic">Mohin&#299;</span> incarnation of the Lord and acknowledged himself to be defeated. Cupid, however, was himself captivated by the grave and exciting dealings of the goddesses of fortune, and he voluntarily gave up his bow and arrow in a spirit of frustration. Such was the beauty and attraction of the queens of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Yet they could not disturb the transcendental senses of the Lord. This is because the Lord is all-perfect <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;r&#257;ma,</span> or self-sufficient. He does not require anyone's extraneous help for His personal satisfaction. Therefore, the queens could not satisfy the Lord by their feminine attractiveness, but <span class="Italic">they satisfied Him by their sincere affection and service.</span> Only by unalloyed transcendental loving service could they satisfy the Lord, and the Lord was pleased to treat them as wives in reciprocation. Thus being satisfied by their unalloyed service only, the Lord reciprocated the service just like a devout husband. Otherwise He had no business becoming the husband of so many wives. He is the husband of everyone, but to one who accepts Him as such, He reciprocates. This unalloyed affection for the Lord is never to be compared to mundane lust. It is purely transcendental. And the grave dealings, which the queens displayed in natural feminine ways, were also transcendental because the feelings were expressed out of transcendental ecstasy. It is already explained in the previous verse that the Lord appeared like a mundane husband, but factually His relation with His wives was transcendental, pure and unconditioned by the modes of material nature.</div>

<div class="Translation">The common materialistic conditioned souls speculate that the Lord is one of them. Out of their ignorance they think that the Lord is affected by matter, although He is unattached.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The word <span class="Italic">abudha&#7717;</span> is significant here. Due to ignorance only, the foolish mundane wranglers misunderstand the Supreme Lord and spread their foolish imaginations amongst innocent persons by propaganda. The Supreme Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the original primeval Personality of Godhead, and when He was personally present before the eyes of everyone, He displayed full-fledged divine potency in every field of activities. As we have already explained in the first verse of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> He is completely independent to act however He likes, but all His actions are full of bliss, knowledge and eternity. Only the foolish mundaners misunderstand Him, unaware of His eternal form of knowledge and bliss, which is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads.</span> His different potencies work in a perfect plan of natural sequence, and doing everything by the agency of His different potencies, He remains eternally the supreme independent. When He descends on the material world by His causeless mercy to different living beings, He does so by His own potency. He is not subject to any condition of the material modes of nature, and He descends as He is originally. The mental speculators misunderstand Him as the Supreme Person, and they consider His impersonal features as inexplicable Brahman to be all. Such a conception is also the product of conditioned life because they cannot go beyond their own personal capacity. Therefore, one who considers the Lord on the level of one's limited potency is only a common man. Such a man cannot be convinced that the Personality of Godhead is always unaffected by the modes of material nature. He cannot understand that the sun is always unaffected by infectious matter. The mental speculators compare everything from the standpoint of experimental knowledge of their own selves. Thus when the Lord is found to act like an ordinary person in matrimonial bondage, they consider Him to be like one of them, without considering that the Lord can at once marry sixteen thousand wives or more. Due to a poor fund of knowledge they accept one side of the picture while disbelieving the other. This means that due to ignorance only they always think of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as like themselves and make their own conclusions, which are absurd and unauthentic from the version of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span></div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and Vedic literatures (<span class="Italic">&#346;ruti</span> and <span class="Italic">Sm&#7771;ti</span>) it is affirmed that in the Divinity there is nothing material. He is transcendental (<span class="Italic">nirgu&#7751;a</span>) only, the supreme cognizant. Hari, or the Personality of Godhead, is the supreme transcendental person situated beyond the range of material affection. These statements are also confirmed even by &#256;c&#257;rya &#346;a&#7749;kara.

The answer is that the divinity of the Personality of Godhead is never in contact with the qualities of material nature in any circumstances. Actually He is in contact with such qualities because He is the ultimate source of everything, yet He is above the actions of such qualities. He is known, therefore, as Yoge&#347;vara, or the master of mystic power, or in other words the all-powerful. Even His learned devotees are not affected by the influence of the material modes. The great six Gosv&#257;m&#299;s of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana all came from greatly rich and aristocratic families, but when they adopted the life of mendicants at V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, superficially they appeared to be in wretched conditions of life, but factually they were the richest of all in spiritual values. Such <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavatas,</span> or first-grade devotees, although moving amongst men, are not contaminated by honor or insult, hunger or satisfaction, sleep or wakefulness, which are all resultant actions of the three modes of material nature. Similarly, some of them are engaged in worldly dealings, yet are unaffected. Unless these neutralities of life are there, one cannot be considered situated in transcendence. The Divinity and His associates are on the same transcendental plane, and their glories are always sanctified by the action of <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;,</span> or the internal potency of the Lord. The devotees of the Lord are always transcendental, even if they are sometimes found to have fallen in their behavior. The Lord emphatically declares in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexedd3.html?g=3255">9.30</a>) that even if an unalloyed devotee is found to be fallen due to a previous material contamination, he is nevertheless to be accepted as fully transcendental because of his being engaged cent percent in the devotional service of the Lord. The Lord protects him always because of his rendering service unto Him, and the fallen conditions are to be considered accidental and temporary. They will vanish in no time.</div>

<div class="Translation">The simple and delicate women truly thought that Lord Sri K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, their beloved husband, followed them and was dominated by them.

<div class="First">Even the transcendental wives of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a did not know completely the unfathomable glories of the Lord. This ignorance is not mundane because there is some action of the internal potency of the Lord in the exchange of feelings between Him and His eternal associates. The Lord exchanges transcendental relations in five ways, as proprietor, master, friend, son and lover, and in each of these pastimes He plays fully by the potency of <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;,</span> the internal potency. He plays exactly like an equal friend with the cowherd boys or even with friends like Arjuna. He plays exactly like a son in the presence of Ya&#347;od&#257;m&#257;t&#257;, He plays exactly like a lover in the presence of the cowherd damsels, and He plays exactly like a husband in the presence of the queens of Dv&#257;rak&#257;. Such devotees of the Lord never think of the Lord as the Supreme, but think of Him exactly as a common friend, a pet son, or a lover or husband very much dear to heart and soul. That is the relation between the Lord and His transcendental devotees, who act as His associates in the spiritual sky, where there are innumerable Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets. When the Lord descends, He does so along with His entourage to display a complete picture of the transcendental world, where pure love and devotion for the Lord prevail without any mundane tinge of lording it over the creation of the Lord. Such devotees of the Lord are all liberated souls, perfect representations of the marginal or internal potency in complete negation of the influence of the external potency. The wives of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a were made to forget the immeasurable glories of the Lord by the internal potency so that there might not be any flaw of exchange, and they took it for granted that the Lord was a henpecked husband, always following them in lonely places. In other words, even the personal associates of the Lord do not know Him perfectly well, so what do the thesis writers or mental speculators know about the transcendental glories of the Lord? The mental speculators present different theses as to His becoming the causes of the creation, the ingredients of the creation, or the material and efficient cause of the creation, etc., but all this is but partial knowledge about the Lord. Factually they are as ignorant as the common man. The Lord can be known by the mercy of the Lord only, and by no other means. But since the dealings of the Lord with His wives are based on pure transcendental love and devotion, the wives are all on the transcendental plane without material contamination.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The king of Hastin&#257;pura (now Delhi) used to be the emperor of the world, at least till the time of the son of Emperor Par&#299;k&#7779;it. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was saved by the Lord in the womb of his mother, so he could certainly be saved from an untimely death due to the ill will of the son of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> Because the age of Kali began to act just after the assumption of power by Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, the first sign of misgivings was exhibited in the cursing of such a greatly intelligent and devoted king as Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it. The king is the protector of the helpless citizens, and their welfare, peace and prosperity depend on him. Unfortunately, by the instigation of the fallen age of Kali, an unfortunate <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a's</span> son was employed to condemn the innocent Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, and so the King had to prepare himself for death within seven days. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it is especially famous as one who is protected by Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and when he was unduly cursed by a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a's</span> son, he could have invoked the mercy of the Lord to save him, but he did not want to because he was a pure devotee. A pure devotee never asks the Lord for any undue favor. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it knew that the curse of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a's</span> son upon him was unjustified, as everyone else knew, but he did not want to counteract it because he knew also that the age of Kali had begun and that the first symptom of the age, namely degradation of the highly talented <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> community, had also begun. He did not want to interfere with the current of the time, but he prepared himself to meet death very cheerfully and very properly. Being fortunate, he got at least seven days to prepare himself to meet death, and so he properly utilized the time in the association of &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, the great saint and devotee of the Lord.</div>

The effect of such a bona fide hearing and chanting of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> was equally shared by both the hearer and the chanter. Both of them were benefited. Out of the nine different transcendental means of devotional service to the Lord prescribed in the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> either all of them, or some of them or even one of them are equally beneficial if properly discharged. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it and &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; were serious performers of the first two important items, namely the process of chanting and the process of hearing, and therefore both of them were successful in their laudable attempt. Transcendental realization is attained by such serious hearing and chanting and not otherwise. There is a type of spiritual master and disciple much advertised in this age of Kali. It is said that the master injects spiritual force into the disciple by an electrical current generated by the master, and the disciple begins to feel the shock. He becomes unconscious, and the master weeps for his exhausting his store of so-called spiritual assets. Such bogus advertisement is going on in this age, and the poor common man is becoming the victim of such advertisement. We do not find such folk tales in the dealings of &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; and his great disciple Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it. The sage recited <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> in devotion, and the great King heard him properly. The King did not feel any shock of electrical current from the master, nor did he become unconscious while receiving knowledge from the master. One should not, therefore, become a victim of these unauthorized advertisements made by some bogus representative of Vedic knowledge. The sages of Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya were very respectful in hearing about Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it because of his receiving knowledge from &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; by means of <span class="Italic">ardent hearing.</span> Ardent hearing from the bona fide master is the only way to receive transcendental knowledge, and there is no need for medical performances or occult mysticism for miraculous effects. The process is simple, but only the sincere party can achieve the desired result.</div>

<div class="Translation">&#346;r&#299; S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; said: Emperor Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira administered generously to everyone during his reign. He was exactly like his father. He had no personal ambition and was freed from all sorts of sense gratification because of his continuous service unto the lotus feet of the Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">As mentioned in our introduction, "There is a need for the science of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in human society for all the suffering humanity of the world, and we simply request the leading personalities of all nations to take to the science of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a for their own good, for the good of society, and for the good of all the people of the world." So it is confirmed herein by the example of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, the personality of goodness. In India the people hanker after <span class="Italic">R&#257;ma-r&#257;jya</span> because the Personality of Godhead was the ideal king and all other kings or emperors in India controlled the destiny of the world for the prosperity of every living being who took birth on the earth. Herein the word <span class="Italic">praj&#257;&#7717;</span> is significant. The etymological import of the word is "that which is born." On the earth there are many species of life, from the aquatics up to the perfect human beings, and all are known as <span class="Italic">praj&#257;s.</span> Lord Brahm&#257;, the creator of this particular universe, is known as the <span class="Italic">praj&#257;pati</span> because he is the grandfather of all who have taken birth. Thus <span class="Italic">praj&#257;</span> is used in a broader sense than it is now used. The king represents all living beings, the aquatics, plants, trees, reptiles, birds, animals and man. Every one of them is a part and parcel of the Supreme Lord (Bg. <a href="indexf156.html?g=4632">14.4</a>), and the king, being the representative of the Supreme Lord, is duty-bound to give proper protection to every one of them. This is not the case with the presidents and dictators of this demoralized system of administration, where the lower animals are given no protection while the higher animals are given so-called protection. But this is a great science which can be learned only by one who knows the <span class="Italic">science of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</span> By knowing the science of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, one can become the most perfect man in the world, and unless one has knowledge in this science, all qualifications and doctorate diplomas acquired by academic education are spoiled and useless. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira knew this science of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a very well, for it is stated here that by continuous cultivation of this science, or by continuous devotional service to Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, he acquired the qualification of administering the state. The father is sometimes seemingly cruel to the son, but that does not mean that the father has lost the qualification to be a father. A father is always a father because he always has the good of the son at heart. The father wants every one of his sons to become a better man than himself. Therefore, a king like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, who was the personality of goodness, wanted everyone under his administration, especially human beings who have better developed consciousness, to become devotees of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a so that everyone can become free from the trifles of material existence. His motto of administration was all good for the citizens, for as personified goodness he knew perfectly well what is actually good for them. He conducted the administration on that principle, and not on the <span class="Italic">r&#257;k&#7779;asi,</span> demonic, principle of sense gratification. As an ideal king, he had no personal ambition, and there was no place for sense gratification because all his senses at all times were engaged in the loving service of the Supreme Lord, which includes the partial service to the living beings, who form the parts and parcels of the complete whole. Those who are busy rendering service to the parts and parcels, leaving aside the whole, only spoil time and energy, as one does when watering the leaves of a tree without watering the root. If water is poured on the root, the leaves are enlivened perfectly and automatically, but if water is poured on the leaves only, the whole energy is spoiled. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, therefore, was constantly engaged in the service of the Lord, and thus the parts and parcels of the Lord, the living beings under his careful administration, were perfectly attended with all comforts in this life and all progress in the next. That is the way of perfect management of state administration.</div>

<div class="First">Only a rich and great man's name and fame are known all over the world, and the name and fame of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira reached the higher planets because of his good administration, worldly possessions, glorious wife Draupad&#299;, the strength of his brothers Bh&#299;ma and Arjuna, and his solid sovereign power over the world, known as Jamb&#363;dv&#299;pa. Here the word <span class="Italic">lok&#257;&#7717;</span> is significant. There are different <span class="Italic">lokas</span> or higher planets scattered all over the sky, both material and spiritual.

No forceful entrance is allowed there. The tiny material scientists and engineers who have discovered vehicles to travel over a few thousand miles in outer space will not be allowed entrance. That is not the way to reach the better planets. One must qualify himself to enter into such happy planets by sacrifice and service. Those who are sinful in every step of life can expect only to be degraded into animal life to suffer more and more the pangs of material existence, and this is also stated in <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexeb92.html?g=5150">16.19</a>).

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">O br&#257;hma&#7751;as, the opulence of the King was so enchanting that the denizens of heaven aspired for it. But because he was absorbed in the service of the Lord, nothing could satisfy him except the Lord's service.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">There are two things in the world which can satisfy living beings. When one is materially engrossed, he is satisfied only by sense gratification, but when one is liberated from the conditions of the material modes, he is satisfied only by rendering loving service for the satisfaction of the Lord. This means that the living being is constitutionally a <span class="Italic">servitor,</span> and not one who is <span class="Italic">served.</span> Being illusioned by the conditions of the external energy, one falsely thinks himself to be the served, but actually he is not served; he is servant of the senses like lust, desire, anger, avarice, pride, madness and intolerance. When one is in his proper senses by attainment of spiritual knowledge, he realizes that he is not the master of the material world, but is only a servant of the senses. At that time he begs for the service of the Lord and thus becomes happy without being illusioned by so-called material happiness. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira was one of the liberated souls, and therefore for him there was no pleasure in a vast kingdom, good wife, obedient brothers, happy subjects and prosperous world. These blessings automatically follow for a pure devotee, even though the devotee does not aspire for them. The example set herein is exactly suitable. It is said that one who is hungry is never satisfied by anything other than food.</div>
<div class="Purport">The whole material world is full of hungry living beings. The hunger is not for good food, shelter or sense gratification. <span class="Italic">The hunger is for the spiritual atmosphere.</span> Due to ignorance only they think that the world is dissatisfied because there is not sufficient food, shelter, defense and objects of sense gratification. This is called illusion. When the living being is hungry for spiritual satisfaction, he is misrepresented by material hunger. But the foolish leaders cannot see that even the people who are most sumptuously materially satisfied are still hungry. And what is their hunger and poverty? This hunger is actually for spiritual food, spiritual shelter, spiritual defense and spiritual sense gratification. These can be obtained in the association of the Supreme Spirit, Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and therefore one who has them cannot be attracted by the so-called food, shelter, defense and sense gratification of the material world, even if they are relished by the denizens of the heavenly planets. Therefore, in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexa520.html?g=2877">8.16</a>) it is said by the Lord that even in the topmost planet of the universe, namely the Brahmaloka, where the duration of life is multiplied by millions of years by earth calculation, one cannot satisfy his hunger. Such hunger can be satisfied only when the living being is situated in immortality, which is attained in the spiritual sky, far, far above the Brahmaloka, in the association of Lord Mukunda, the Lord who awards His devotees the transcendental pleasure of liberation.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Death generally involves remaining in trance for seven months. A living being, according to his own action, is allowed to enter into the womb of a mother by the vehicle of a father's semina, and thus he develops his desired body. This is the law of birth in specific bodies according to one's past actions. When he is awake from trance, he feels the inconvenience of being confined within the womb, and thus he wants to come out of it and sometimes fortunately prays to the Lord for such liberation. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, while in the womb of his mother, was struck by the <span class="Italic">brahm&#257;stra</span> released by A&#347;vatth&#257;m&#257;, and he was feeling the burning heat. But because he was a devotee of the Lord, the Lord at once appeared Himself within the womb by His all-powerful energy, and the child could see that someone else had come to save him.

<div class="First">It is said in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> (Ch. 5) that the Supreme Lord Govinda, by His one plenary portion, enters into the halo of the universe and distributes himself as Param&#257;tm&#257;, or the Supersoul, not only within the heart of every living being, but also within every atom of the material elements. Thus the Lord is all-pervading by His inconceivable potency, and thus He entered the womb of Uttar&#257; to save His beloved devotee Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it. In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexa9e1.html?g=3264">9.31</a>) the Lord assured everyone that His devotees are never to be vanquished. No one can kill a devotee of the Lord because he is protected by the Lord, and no one can save a person whom the Lord desires to kill. The Lord is all-powerful, and therefore He can both save and kill as He likes. He became visible to His devotee Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it even in that awkward position (in the womb of his mother) in a shape just suitable for his vision. The Lord can become bigger than thousands of universes and can become smaller than an atom at the same time. Merciful as He is, He becomes just suitable to the vision of the limited living being. He is unlimited. He is not limited by any measurement of our calculation. He can become bigger than what we can think of, and He can become smaller than what we can conceive. But in all circumstances He is the same all-powerful Lord. There is no difference between the thumblike Vi&#7779;&#7751;u in the womb of Uttar&#257; and the full-fledged N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a in the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha-dh&#257;ma, the kingdom of Godhead. He accepts the form of <span class="Italic">arca-vigraha</span> (worshipable Deity) just to accept service from His different incapable devotees. By the mercy of the <span class="Italic">arca-vigraha,</span> the form of the Lord in material elements, the devotees who are in the material world can easily approach the Lord, although He is not conceivable by the material senses. The <span class="Italic">arca-vigraha</span> is therefore an all-spiritual form of the Lord to be perceived by the material devotees; such an <span class="Italic">arca-vigraha</span> of the Lord is never to be considered material. There is no difference between matter and spirit for the Lord, although there is a gulf of difference between the two in the case of the conditioned living being. For the Lord there is nothing but spiritual existence, and similarly there is nothing except spiritual existence for the pure devotee of the Lord in his intimate relation with the Lord.</div>

<div class="First">Child Par&#299;k&#7779;it was not observing a living being who is limited by time and space. There is a gulf of difference between the Lord and the individual living being. The Lord is mentioned herein as the supreme living being unlimited by time and space. Every living being is limited by time and space. Even though a living being is qualitatively one with the Lord, quantitatively there is a great difference between the Supreme Soul and the common individual soul. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> both the living beings and the Supreme Being are said to be all-pervading (<span class="Italic">yena sarvam ida&#7745; tatam</span>), yet there is a difference between these two kinds of all-pervasiveness. A common living being or soul can be all-pervading within his own limited body, but the supreme living being is all-pervading in all space and all time. A common living being cannot extend its influence over another common living being by its all-pervasiveness, but the Supreme Supersoul, the Personality of Godhead, is unlimitedly able to exert His influence over all places and all times and over all living beings. And because He is all-pervasive, unlimited by time and space, He can appear even within the womb of the mother of child Par&#299;k&#7779;it. He is mentioned herein as the protector of the righteous. Anyone who is a surrendered soul unto the Supreme is righteous, and he is specifically protected by the Lord in all circumstances. The Lord is the indirect protector of the unrighteous also, for He rectifies their sins through His external potency. The Lord is mentioned herein as one who is dressed in the ten directions. This means dressed with garments on ten sides, up and down. He is present everywhere and can appear and disappear at His will from everywhere and anywhere. His disappearance from the sight of the child Par&#299;k&#7779;it does not mean that He appeared on the spot from any other place. He was present there, and even after His disappearance He was there, although invisible to the eyes of the child. This material covering of the effulgent firmament is also something like a womb of the mother nature, and we are all put into the womb by the Lord, the father of all living beings. He is present everywhere, even in this material womb of mother Durg&#257;, and those who are deserving can see the Lord.</div>

<div class="First">Astronomical calculations of stellar influences upon a living being are not suppositions, but are factual, as confirmed in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> Every living being is controlled by the laws of nature at every minute, just as a citizen is controlled by the influence of the state. The state laws are grossly observed, but the laws of material nature, being subtle to our gross understanding, cannot be experienced grossly. As stated in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexde01.html?g=1113">3.9</a>), every action of life produces another reaction, which is binding upon us, and only those who are acting on behalf of Yaj&ntilde;a (Vi&#7779;&#7751;u) are not bound by reactions. Our actions are judged by the higher authorities, the agents of the Lord, and thus we are awarded bodies according to our activities. The law of nature is so subtle that every part of our body is influenced by the respective stars, and a living being obtains his working body to fulfill his terms of imprisonment by the manipulation of such astronomical influence. A man's destiny is therefore ascertained by the birthtime constellation of stars, and a factual horoscope is made by a learned astrologer. It is a great science, and misuse of a science does not make it useless. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it or even the Personality of Godhead appear in certain constellations of good stars, and thus the influence is exerted upon the body thus born at an auspicious moment. The most auspicious constellation of stars takes place during the appearance of the Lord in this material world, and it is specifically called <span class="Italic">jayant&#299;,</span> a word not to be abused for any other purposes. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was not only a great <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> emperor, but also a great devotee of the Lord. Thus he cannot take his birth at any inauspicious moment. As a proper place and time is selected to receive a respectable personage, so also to receive such a personality as Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, who was especially cared for by the Supreme Lord, a suitable moment is chosen when all good stars assembled together to exert their influence upon the King. Thus he took his birth just to be known as the great hero of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> This suitable arrangement of astral influences is never a creation of man's will, but is the arrangement of the superior management of the agency of the Supreme Lord. Of course, the arrangement is made according to the good or bad deeds of the living being. Herein lies the importance of pious acts performed by the living being. Only by pious acts can one be allowed to get good wealth, good education and beautiful features. The <span class="Italic">sa&#7745;sk&#257;ras</span> of the school of <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana-dharma</span> (man's eternal engagement) are highly suitable for creating an atmosphere for taking advantage of good stellar influences, and therefore <span class="Italic">garbh&#257;dh&#257;na-sa&#7745;sk&#257;ra,</span> or the first seedling purificatory process prescribed for the higher castes, is the beginning of all pious acts to receive a good pious and intelligent class of men in human society. There will be peace and prosperity in the world due to good and sane population only; there is hell and disturbance only because of the unwanted, insane populace addicted to sex indulgence.</div>

<div class="Translation">King Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, who was very satisfied with the birth of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, had the purificatory process of birth performed. Learned br&#257;hma&#7751;as, headed by Dhaumya and K&#7771;pa, recited auspicious hymns.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">There is a need for a good and intelligent class of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> who are expert in performing the purificatory processes prescribed in the system of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma.</span> Unless such purificatory processes are performed, there is no possibility of good population, and in the age of Kali the population all over the world is of <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> quality or lower for want of this purificatory process. It is not possible, however, to revive the Vedic process of purification in this age, for want of proper facilities and good <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> but there is the <span class="Italic">P&#257;&ntilde;car&#257;trika</span> system also recommended for this age. The <span class="Italic">P&#257;&ntilde;car&#257;trika</span> system acts on the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> class of men, supposedly the population of the Kali-yuga, and it is the prescribed purificatory process suitable to the age and time. Such a purificatory process is allowed only for spiritual upliftment and not for any other purpose. Spiritual upliftment is never conditioned by higher or lower parentage.</div>
<div class="Purport">After the <span class="Italic">garbh&#257;dh&#257;na</span> purificatory process, there are certain other <span class="Italic">sa&#7745;sk&#257;ras</span> like <span class="Italic">s&#299;mantonnayana, sadhabhak&#7779;a&#7751;am,</span> etc., during the period of pregnancy, and when the child is born the first purificatory process is <span class="Italic">j&#257;takarman.</span> This was performed duly by Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira with the help of good and learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> like Dhaumya, the royal priest, and K&#7771;p&#257;c&#257;rya, who was not only a priest but also a great general. Both these learned and perfect priests, assisted by other good <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> were employed by Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira to perform the ceremony. Therefore all the <span class="Italic">sa&#7745;sk&#257;ras,</span> purificatory processes, are not mere formalities or social functions only, but they are all for practical purposes and can be successfully performed by expert <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> like Dhaumya and K&#7771;pa. Such <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are not only rare, but also not available in this age, and therefore, for the purpose of spiritual upliftment in this fallen age, the Gosv&#257;m&#299;s prefer the purificatory processes under <span class="Italic">P&#257;&ntilde;car&#257;trika</span> formulas to the Vedic rites.</div>
<div class="Purport">K&#7771;p&#257;c&#257;rya is the son of the great &#7770;&#7779;i Sardban and was born in the family of Gautama. The birth is said to be accidental. By chance, the great &#7770;&#7779;i Sardban met Janapad&#299;, a famous society girl of heaven, and the &#7770;&#7779;i Sardban discharged semina in two parts. By one part immediately a male child and by the other part a female child were born as twins. The male child was later on known as K&#7771;pa, and the female child was known as K&#7771;p&#299;. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#346;antanu, while engaged in chase in the jungle, picked up the children and brought them up to the brahminical status by the proper purificatory process. K&#7771;p&#257;c&#257;rya later became a great general like Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya, and his sister was married to Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya. K&#7771;p&#257;c&#257;rya later on took part in the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra and joined the party of Duryodhana. K&#7771;p&#257;c&#257;rya helped kill Abhimanyu, the father of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, but he was still held in esteem by the family of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas due to his being as great a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> as Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya. When the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas were sent to the forest after being defeated in the gambling game with Duryodhana, Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra entrusted the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas to K&#7771;p&#257;c&#257;rya for guidance. After the end of the battle, K&#7771;p&#257;c&#257;rya again became a member of the royal assembly, and he was called during the birth of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it for recitation of auspicious Vedic hymns to make the ceremony successful. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, while quitting the palace for his great departure to the Himalayas, entrusted K&#7771;p&#257;c&#257;rya with Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it as his disciple, and he left home satisfied because of K&#7771;p&#257;c&#257;rya's taking charge of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it. The great administrators, kings and emperors were always under the guidance of learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> like K&#7771;p&#257;c&#257;rya and thus were able to act properly in the discharge of political responsibilities.</div>

<div class="Translation">Upon the birth of a son, the King, who knew how, where and when charity should be given, gave gold, land, villages, elephants, horses and good food grains to the br&#257;hma&#7751;as.<span class="Italic"></span></div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Only the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s</span> are authorized to accept charity from the householders. In all the different occasions of <span class="Italic">sa&#7745;sk&#257;ras,</span> especially during the time of birth, marriage and death, wealth is distributed to the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> because the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> give the highest quality of service in regard to the prime necessity of humankind. The charity was substantial in the shape of gold, land, villages, horses, elephants and food grains, with other materials for cooking complete foodstuff. The <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> were not, therefore, poor in the actual sense of the term. On the contrary, because they possessed gold, land, villages, horses, elephants and sufficient grains, they had nothing to earn for themselves. They would simply devote themselves to the well-being of the entire society.</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">t&#299;rthavit</span> is significant because the King knew well where and when charity has to be given. Charity is never unproductive or blind. In the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> charity was offered to persons who deserve to accept charity by dint of spiritual enlightenment. The so-called <span class="Italic">daridra-n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a,</span> a misconception of the Supreme Lord by unauthorized persons, is never to be found in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> as the object of charity. Nor can a wretched poor man receive much munificent charity in the way of horses, elephants, land and villages. The conclusion is that the intelligent men, or the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> specifically engaged in the service of the Lord, were properly maintained without anxiety for the needs of the body, and the King and other householders gladly looked after all their comforts.</div>
<div class="Purport">It is enjoined in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> that as long as a child is joined with the mother by the navel pipe, the child is considered to be of one body with the mother, but as soon as the pipe is cut and the child is separated from the mother, the purificatory process of <span class="Italic">j&#257;takarman</span> is performed. The administrative demigods and past forefathers of the family come to see a newly born child, and such an occasion is specifically accepted as the proper time for distributing wealth to the right persons productively for the spiritual advancement of society.</div>

<div class="Translation">The br&#257;hma&#7751;as said: This spotless son has been restored by the all-powerful and all-pervasive Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Personality of Godhead, in order to oblige you. He was saved when he was doomed to be destroyed by an irresistible supernatural weapon.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The child Par&#299;k&#7779;it was saved by the all-powerful and all-pervasive Vi&#7779;&#7751;u (Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a) for two reasons. The first reason is that the child in the womb of his mother was spotless due to his being a pure devotee of the Lord. The second reason is that the child was the only surviving male descendant of Puru, the pious forefather of the virtuous King Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira. The Lord wants to continue the line of pious kings to rule over the earth as His representatives for the actual progress of a peaceful and prosperous life. After the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra, even up to the next generation of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira was annihilated, and there were none who could generate another son in the great royal family. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, the son of Abhimanyu, was the only surviving heir apparent in the family, and by the irresistible supernatural <span class="Italic">brahm&#257;stra</span> weapon of A&#347;vatth&#257;m&#257;, he was forced to be annihilated. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is described herein as Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and this is also significant. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the original Personality of Godhead, does the work of protection and annihilation in His capacity of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is the plenary expansion of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The all-pervasive activities of the Lord are executed by Him in His Vi&#7779;&#7751;u feature. Child Par&#299;k&#7779;it is described here as spotlessly white because he is an unalloyed devotee of the Lord. Such unalloyed devotees of the Lord appear on the earth just to execute the mission of the Lord. The Lord desires the conditioned souls hovering in the material creation to be reclaimed to go back home, back to Godhead, and thus He helps them by preparing the transcendental literatures like the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> by sending missionaries of saints and sages and by deputing His representative, the spiritual master. Such transcendental literatures, missionaries and representatives of the Lord are spotlessly white because the contamination of the material qualities cannot even touch them. They are always protected by the Lord when they are threatened with annihilation. Such foolish threats are made by the gross materialists. The <span class="Italic">brahm&#257;stra,</span> which was thrown by A&#347;vatth&#257;m&#257; at the child Par&#299;k&#7779;it, was certainly supernaturally powerful, and nothing of the material world could resist its force of penetration. But the all-powerful Lord, who is present everywhere, within and without, could counteract it by His all-powerful potency just to save a bona fide servant of the Lord and descendant of another devotee, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, who was always obliged by the Lord by His causeless mercy.</div>

<div class="Translation">For this reason this child will be well known in the world as one who is protected by the Personality of Godhead. O most fortunate one, there is no doubt that this child will become a first-class devotee and will be qualified with all good qualities.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Lord gives protection to all living beings because He is their supreme leader. The Vedic hymns confirm that the Lord is the Supreme Person amongst all personalities. The difference between the two living beings is that the one, the Personality of Godhead, provides for all other living beings, and by knowing Him one can achieve eternal peace (<span class="Italic">Ka&#7789;ha Upani&#7779;ad</span>). Such protection is given by His different potencies to different grades of living beings. But as far as His unalloyed devotees are concerned, He gives the protection personally. Therefore, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it is protected from the very beginning of his appearance in the womb of his mother. And because he is especially given protection by the Lord, the indication must be concluded that the child would be a first-grade devotee of the Lord with all good qualities. There are three grades of devotees, namely the <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata, madhyam-adhik&#257;r&#299;</span> and the <span class="Italic">kani&#7779;&#7789;ha-adhik&#257;r&#299;.</span> Those who go to the temples of the Lord and offer worshipful respect to the Deity without sufficient knowledge in the theological science and therefore without any respect for the devotees of the Lord are called materialistic devotees, or <span class="Italic">kani&#7779;&#7789;ha-adhik&#257;r&#299;,</span> the third-grade devotees. Secondly, the devotees who have developed a mentality of genuine service to the Lord and who thus make friendships only with similar devotees, show favor to the neophytes and avoid the atheists are called the second-grade devotees. But those who see everything in the Lord or everything of the Lord and also see in everything an eternal relation of the Lord, so that there is nothing within their purview of sight except the Lord, are called the <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavatas,</span> or the first-grade devotees of the Lord. Such first-grade devotees of the Lord are perfect in all respects. A devotee who may be in any of these categories is automatically qualified by all good qualities, and thus a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata</span> devotee like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it is certainly perfect in all respects. And because Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it took his birth in the family of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, he is addressed herein as the <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata,</span> or the greatest of the fortunates. The family in which a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata</span> takes his birth is fortunate because due to the birth of a first-grade devotee the members of the family, past, present and future up to one hundred generations, become liberated by the grace of the Lord, out of respect for His beloved devotee. Therefore, the highest benefit is done to one's family simply by becoming an unalloyed devotee of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation">The good King [Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira] inquired: O great souls, will he become as saintly a king, as pious in his very name and as famous and glorified in his achievements, as others who appeared in this great royal family?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The forefathers of King Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira were all great saintly kings, pious and glorified by their great achievements. They were all saints on the royal throne. And therefore all the members of the state were happy, pious, well behaved, prosperous and spiritually enlightened. Under strict guidance of the great souls and spiritual injunctions, such great saintly kings were trained up, and as a result the kingdom was full of saintly persons and was a happy land of spiritual life. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira was himself a replica of his ancestors, and he desired that the next king after him become exactly like his great forefathers. He was happy to learn from the learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> that by astrological calculations the child would be born a first-grade devotee of the Lord, and more confidentially he wanted to know whether the child was going to follow in the footsteps of his great forefathers. That is the way of the monarchical state. The reigning king should be a pious, chivalrous devotee of the Lord and fear personified for the upstarts. He must also leave an heir apparent equally qualified to rule over the innocent citizens. In the modern setup of the democratic states, the people themselves are fallen to the qualities of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> or less, and the government is run by their representative, who is ignorant of the scriptural mode of administrative education. Thus the whole atmosphere is surcharged with <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> qualities, manifested by lust and avarice. Such administrators quarrel every day among themselves. The cabinet of ministers changes often due to party and group selfishness. Everyone wants to exploit the state resources till he dies. No one retires from political life unless forced to do so. How can such low-grade men do good to the people? The result is corruption, intrigue and hypocrisy. They should learn from the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> how ideal the administrators must be before they can be given charge of different posts.</div>

<div class="Translation">The learned br&#257;hma&#7751;as said: O son of P&#7771;th&#257;, this child shall be exactly like King Ik&#7779;v&#257;ku, son of Manu, in maintaining all those who are born.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"><span class="Italic">Praj&#257;</span> means the living being who has taken his birth in the material world. Actually the living being has no birth and no death, but because of his separation from the service of the Lord and due to his desire to lord it over material nature, he is offered a suitable body to satisfy his material desires. In doing so, one becomes conditioned by the laws of material nature, <span class="Italic">and the material body is changed in terms of his own work.</span> The living entity thus transmigrates from one body to another in 8,400,000 species of life. But due to his being the part and parcel of the Lord, he not only is maintained with all necessaries of life by the Lord, but also is protected by the Lord and His representatives, the saintly kings. These saintly kings give protection to all the <span class="Italic">praj&#257;s,</span> or living beings, to live and to fulfill their terms of imprisonment. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was actually an ideal saintly king because while touring his kingdom he happened to see that a poor cow was about to be killed by the personified Kali, whom he at once took to task as a murderer. This means that even the animals were given protection by the saintly administrators, not from any sentimental point of view, but because those who have taken their birth in the material world have the right to live. All the saintly kings, beginning from the King of the sun globe down to the King of the earth, are so inclined by the influence of the Vedic literatures. The Vedic literatures are taught in higher planets also, as there is reference in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexc8a8.html?g=1430">4.1</a>) about the teachings to the sun-god (Vivasv&#257;n) by the Lord, and such lessons are transferred by disciplic succession, as it was done by the sun-god to his son Manu, and from Manu to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ik&#7779;v&#257;ku. There are fourteen Manus in one day of Brahm&#257;, and the Manu referred to herein is the seventh Manu, who is one of the <span class="Italic">praj&#257;patis</span> (those who create progeny), and he is the son of the sun-god. He is known as the Vaivasvata Manu. He had ten sons, and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ik&#7779;v&#257;ku is one of them. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ik&#7779;v&#257;ku also learned <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> as taught in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> from his father, Manu, who got it from his father, the sun-god. Later on the teaching of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> came down by disciplic succession from Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ik&#7779;v&#257;ku, but in course of time the chain was broken by unscrupulous persons, and therefore it again had to be taught to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kuruk&#7779;etra. So all the Vedic literatures are current from the very beginning of creation of the material world, and thus the Vedic literatures are known as <span class="Italic">apauru&#7779;eya</span> (not made by man). The Vedic knowledge was spoken by the Lord and first heard by Brahm&#257;, the first created living being within the universe.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ik&#7779;v&#257;ku:</span> One of the sons of Vaivasvata Manu. He had one hundred sons. He prohibited meat eating. His son &#346;a&#347;&#257;da became the next king after his death.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Manu:</span> The Manu mentioned in this verse as the father of Ik&#7779;v&#257;ku is the seventh Manu, of the name Vaivasvata Manu, the son of sun-god Vivasv&#257;n, to whom Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a instructed the teachings of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> prior to His teaching them to Arjuna. Mankind is the descendant of Manu. This Vaivasvata Manu had ten sons, named Ik&#7779;v&#257;ku, Nabhaga, Dh&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;a, &#346;ary&#257;ti, Nari&#7779;yanta, N&#257;bh&#257;ga, Di&#7779;&#7789;a, Kar&#363;&#7779;a, P&#7771;&#7779;adhra and Vasum&#257;n. The Lord's incarnation Matsya (the gigantic fish) was advented during the beginning of Vaivasvata Manu's reign. He learned the principles of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> from his father, Vivasv&#257;n, the sun-god, and he reinstructed the same to his son Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ik&#7779;v&#257;ku. In the beginning of the Tret&#257;-yuga the sun-god instructed devotional service to Manu, and Manu in his turn instructed it to Ik&#7779;v&#257;ku for the welfare of the whole human society.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Lord R&#257;ma:</span> The Supreme Personality of Godhead incarnated Himself as &#346;r&#299; R&#257;ma, accepting the sonhood of His pure devotee Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Da&#347;aratha, the King of Ayodhy&#257;. Lord R&#257;ma descended along with His plenary portions, and all of them appeared as His younger brothers. In the month of Caitra on the ninth day of the growing moon in the Tret&#257;-yuga, the Lord appeared, as usual, to establish the principles of religion and to annihilate the disturbing elements. When He was just a young boy, He helped the great sage Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra by killing Subahu and striking M&#257;r&#299;ca, the she-demon, who was disturbing the sages in their daily discharge of duties. The <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> are meant to cooperate for the welfare of the mass of people. The <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> sages endeavor to enlighten the people by perfect knowledge, and the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> are meant for their protection. Lord R&#257;macandra is the ideal king for maintaining and protecting the highest culture of humanity, known as <span class="Italic">brahma&#7751;ya-dharma.</span> The Lord is specifically the protector of the cows and the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> and hence He enhances the prosperity of the world. He rewarded the administrative demigods by effective weapons to conquer the demons through the agency of Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra. He was present in the bow sacrifice of King Janaka, and by breaking the invincible bow of &#346;iva, He married S&#299;t&#257;dev&#299;, daughter of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Janaka.</div>
<div class="Purport">After His marriage He accepted exile in the forest for fourteen years by the order of His father, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Da&#347;aratha. To help the administration of the demigods, He killed fourteen thousand demons, and by the intrigues of the demons, His wife, S&#299;t&#257;dev&#299;, was kidnapped by R&#257;va&#7751;a. He made friendship with Sugr&#299;va, who was helped by the Lord to kill Vali, brother of Sugr&#299;va. By the help of Lord R&#257;ma, Sugr&#299;va became the king of the V&#257;&#7751;aras (a race of gorillas). The Lord built a floating bridge of stones on the Indian Ocean and reached La&#7749;k&#257;, the kingdom of R&#257;va&#7751;a, who had kidnapped S&#299;t&#257;. Later on R&#257;va&#7751;a was killed by Him, and R&#257;va&#7751;a's brother Vibh&#299;&#7779;a&#7751;a was installed on the throne of La&#7749;k&#257;. Vibh&#299;&#7779;a&#7751;a was one of the brothers of R&#257;va&#7751;a, a demon, but Lord R&#257;ma made him immortal by His blessings. On the expiry of fourteen years, after settling the affairs at La&#7749;k&#257;, the Lord came back to His kingdom, Ayodhy&#257;, by flower plane. He instructed His brother &#346;atrughna to attack Lav&#7751;&#257;sura, who reigned at Mathur&#257;, and the demon was killed. He performed ten A&#347;vamedha sacrifices, and later on He disappeared while taking a bath in the &#346;arayu River. The great epic <span class="Italic">R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</span> is the history of Lord R&#257;ma's activities in the world, and the authoritative <span class="Italic">R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</span> was written by the great poet V&#257;lm&#299;ki.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">A king becomes famous by his acts of charity, performances of <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;as,</span> protection of the surrendered, etc. A <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> king is proud to give protection to the surrendered souls. This attitude of a king is called <span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;vara-bhava,</span> or factual power to give protection in a righteous cause. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the Lord instructs living beings to surrender unto Him, and He promises all protection. The Lord is all-powerful and true to His word, and therefore He never fails to give protection to His different devotees. The king, being the representative of the Lord, must possess this attitude of giving protection to the surrendered souls at all risk. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#346;ibi, the King of U&#347;&#299;nara, was an intimate friend of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yay&#257;ti, who was able to reach the heavenly planets along with Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#346;ibi. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#346;ibi was aware of the heavenly planet where he was to be transferred after his death, and the description of this heavenly planet is given in the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic"></B>&#256;di-parva</span></B> 96.6-9). Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#346;ibi was so charitably disposed that he wanted to give over his acquired position in the heavenly kingdom to Yay&#257;ti, but he did not accept it. Yay&#257;ti went to the heavenly planet along with great <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is</span> like A&#7779;&#7789;aka and others. On inquiry from the <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is,</span> Yay&#257;ti gave an account of &#346;ibi's pious acts when all of them were on the path to heaven. He has become a member of the assembly of Yamar&#257;ja, who has become his worshipful deity. As confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> the worshiper of the demigods goes to the planets of the demigods (<span class="Italic">y&#257;nti deva-vrat&#257; dev&#257;n </I>[</I>Bg</I>. </I><a href="index0567.html?g=3210">9.25</a></I>]</span></I>); so Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#346;ibi has become an associate of the great Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava authority Yamar&#257;ja on that particular planet. While he was on the earth he became very famous as a protector of surrendered souls and a donor of charities. The King of heaven once took the shape of a pigeon-hunter bird (eagle), and Agni, the fire-god, took the shape of a pigeon. The pigeon, while being chased by the eagle, took shelter on the lap of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#346;ibi, and the hunter eagle wanted the pigeon back from the King. The King wanted to give it some other meat to eat and requested the bird not to kill the pigeon. The hunter bird refused to accept the King's offer, but it was settled later on that the eagle would accept flesh from the body of the King of the pigeon's equivalent weight. The King began to cut flesh from his body to weigh in the balance equivalent to the weight of the pigeon, but the mystic pigeon always remained heavier. The King then put himself on the balance to equate with the pigeon, and the demigods were pleased with him. The King of heaven and the fire-god disclosed their identity, and the King was blessed by them. Devar&#7779;i N&#257;rada also glorified Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#346;ibi for his great achievements, specifically in charity and protection. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#346;ibi sacrificed his own son for the satisfaction of human beings in his kingdom. And thus child Par&#299;k&#7779;it was to become a second &#346;ibi in charity and protection.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Dau&#7779;yanti Bharata:</span> There are many Bharatas in history, of which Bharata the brother of Lord R&#257;ma, Bharata the son of King &#7770;&#7779;abha, and Bharata the son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Du&#7779;yanta are very famous. And all these Bharatas are historically known to the universe. This earth planet is known as Bh&#257;rata, or Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a, due to King Bharata the son of &#7770;&#7779;abha, but according to some this land is known as Bh&#257;rata due to the reign of the son of Du&#7779;yanta. So far as we are convinced, this land's name Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a was established from the reign of Bharata the son of King &#7770;&#7779;abha. Before him the land was known as Il&#257;vati-var&#7779;a, but just after the coronation of Bharata, the son of &#7770;&#7779;abha, this land became famous as Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a.</div>
<div class="Purport">But despite all this, Bharata, the son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Du&#7779;yanta was not less important. He is the son of the famous beauty &#346;akuntal&#257;. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Du&#7779;yanta fell in love with &#346;akuntal&#257; in the forest, and Bharata was conceived. After that, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja forgot his wife &#346;akuntal&#257; by the curse of Ka&#7751;va Muni, and the child Bharata was brought up in the forest by his mother. Even in his childhood he was so powerful that he challenged the lions and elephants in the forest and would fight with them as little children play with cats and dogs. Because of the boy's becoming so strong, more than the so-called modern Tarzan, the <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is</span> in the forest called him Sarvadaman, or one who is able to control everyone. A full description of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata is given in the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, &#256;di-parva.</span> The P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, or the Kurus, are sometimes addressed as Bh&#257;rata due to being born in the dynasty of the famous Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata, the son of King Du&#7779;yanta.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In history there are two Arjunas. One is K&#257;rttav&#299;rya Arjuna, the King of Haihaya, and the other is the grandfather of the child. Both the Arjunas are famous for their bowmanship, and the child Par&#299;k&#7779;it is foretold to be equal to both of them, particularly in fighting. A short description of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ava Arjuna is given below:</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ava Arjuna:</span> The great hero of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> He is the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u. Queen Kunt&#299;dev&#299; could call for any one of the demigods, and thus she called Indra, and Arjuna was born by him. Arjuna is therefore a plenary part of the heavenly King Indra. He was born in the month of Phalguna (February-March), and therefore he is also called Phalguni. When he appeared as the son of Kunt&#299;, his future greatness was proclaimed by air messages, and all the important personalities from different parts of the universe, such as the demigods, the Gandharvas, the &#256;dityas (from the sun globe), the Rudras, the Vasus, the N&#257;gas, the different <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is</span> (sages) of importance, and the Apsar&#257;s (the society girls of heaven), all attended the ceremony. The Apsar&#257;s pleased everyone by their heavenly dances and songs. Vasudeva, the father of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and the maternal uncle of Arjuna, sent his priest representative Ka&#347;yapa to purify Arjuna by all the prescribed <span class="Italic">sa&#7745;sk&#257;ras,</span> or reformatory processes. His <span class="Italic">sa&#7745;sk&#257;ra</span> of being given a name was performed in the presence of the <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is,</span> residents of &#346;atas&#7771;&#7749;ga. He married four wives, Draupad&#299;, Subhadr&#257;, Citra&#7749;gada and Ul&#363;p&#299;, from whom he got four sons of the names &#346;rutak&#299;rti, Abhimanyu, Babhruv&#257;hana and Ir&#257;v&#257;n respectively.</div>
<div class="Purport">During his student life he was entrusted to study under the great professor Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya, along with other P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas and the Kurus. But he excelled everyone by his studious intensity, and Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya was especially attracted by his disciplinary affection. Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya accepted him as a first-grade scholar and loved heartily to bestow upon him all the blessings of military science. He was so ardent a student that he used to practice bowmanship even at night, and for all these reasons Professor Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya was determined to make him the topmost bowman of the world. He passed very brilliantly the examination in piercing the target, and Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya was very pleased. Royal families at Ma&#7751;ipur and Tripura are descendants of Arjuna's son Babhruv&#257;hana. Arjuna saved Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya from the attack of a crocodile, and the &#256;c&#257;rya, being pleased with him, rewarded him with a weapon of the name <span class="Italic">brahma&#347;ira.</span> Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Drupada was inimical toward Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya, and thus when he attacked the &#256;c&#257;rya, Arjuna got him arrested and brought him before Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya. He besieged a city of the name Ahichhatra, belonging to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Drupada, and after taking it over he gave it to Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya. The confidential treatment of the weapon <span class="Italic">brahma&#347;ira</span> was explained to Arjuna, and Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya was promised by Arjuna that he would use the weapon if necessary when he (Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya) personally became an enemy of Arjuna. By this, the &#256;c&#257;rya forecasted the future battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra, in which Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya was on the opposite side. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Drupada, although defeated by Arjuna on behalf of his professor Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya, decided to hand over his daughter Draupad&#299; to his young combatant, but he was disappointed when he heard the false news of Arjuna's death in the fire of a shellac house intrigued by Duryodhana. He therefore arranged for Draupad&#299;'s personal selection of a groom who could pierce the eye of a fish hanging on the ceiling. This trick was especially made because only Arjuna could do it, and he was successful in his desire to hand over his equally worthy daughter to Arjuna. Arjuna's brothers were at that time living incognito under agreement with Duryodhana, and Arjuna and his brothers attended the meeting of Draupad&#299;'s selection in the dress of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> When all the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> kings assembled saw that a poor <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> had been garlanded by Draupad&#299; for her lord, &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a disclosed his identity to Balar&#257;ma.</div>
<div class="Purport">He met Ul&#363;p&#299; at Haridv&#257;ra (Hardwar), and he was attracted by a girl belonging to N&#257;galoka, and thus Irav&#257;n was born. Similarly, he met Citra&#7749;gada, a daughter of the King of Ma&#7751;ipura, and thus Babhruv&#257;hana was born. Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a made a plan to help Arjuna to kidnap Subhadr&#257;, sister of &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, because Baladeva was inclined to hand her over to Duryodhana. Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira also agreed with &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and thus Subhadr&#257; was taken by force by Arjuna and then married to him. Subhadr&#257;'s son is Abhimanyu, the father of Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, the posthumous child. Arjuna satisfied the fire-god by setting fire to the Kh&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ava Forest, and thus the fire-god gave him one weapon. Indra was angry when the fire was set in the Kh&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ava Forest, and thus Indra, assisted by all other demigods, began fighting with Arjuna for his great challenge. They were defeated by Arjuna, and Indradeva returned to his heavenly kingdom. Arjuna also promised all protection to one May&#257;sura, and the latter presented him one valuable conchshell celebrated as the Devadatta. Similarly, he received many other valuable weapons from Indradeva when he was satisfied to see his chivalry.</div>
<div class="Purport">When Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira was disappointed in defeating the King of Magadha, Jar&#257;sandha, it was Arjuna only who gave King Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira all kinds of assurances, and thus Arjuna, Bh&#299;ma and Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a started for Magadha to kill Jar&#257;sandha. When he went out to bring all other kings of the world under the subjection of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, as was usual after the coronation of every emperor, he conquered the country named Kelinda and brought in subjugation King Bhagdutt. Then he traveled through countries like Antagiri, Ulukpur and Modapur and brought under subjugation all the rulers.</div>
<div class="Purport">Sometimes he underwent severe types of penances, and later on he was rewarded by Indradeva. Lord &#346;iva also wanted to try the strength of Arjuna, and in the form of an aborigine, Lord &#346;iva met him. There was a great fight between the two, and at last Lord &#346;iva was satisfied with him and disclosed his identity. Arjuna prayed to the lord in all humbleness, and the lord, being pleased with him, presented him the <span class="Italic">pa&#347;upata</span> weapon. He acquired many other important weapons from different demigods. He received <span class="Italic">da&#7751;&#7693;&#257;stra</span> from Yamar&#257;ja, <span class="Italic">pa&#347;&#257;stra</span> from Varu&#7751;a, and <span class="Italic">antardhana-astra</span> from Kuvera, the treasurer of the heavenly kingdom. Indra wanted him to come to the heavenly kingdom, the Indraloka planet beyond the moon planet. In that planet he was cordially received by the local residents, and he was awarded reception in the heavenly parliament of Indradeva. Then he met Indradeva, who not only presented him with his <span class="Italic">vajra</span> weapon, but also taught him the military and musical science as used in the heavenly planet. In one sense, Indra is the real father of Arjuna, and therefore indirectly he wanted to entertain Arjuna with the famous society girl of heaven, Urva&#347;&#299;, the celebrated beauty. The society girls of heaven are lusty, and Urva&#347;&#299; was very eager to contact Arjuna, the strongest human being. She met him in his room and expressed her desires but Arjuna sustained his unimpeachable character by closing his eyes before Urva&#347;&#299;, addressing her as mother of the Kuru dynasty and placing her in the category of his mothers Kunt&#299;, M&#257;dr&#299; and &#346;ac&#299;dev&#299;, wife of Indradeva. Disappointed, Urva&#347;&#299; cursed Arjuna and left. In the heavenly planet he also met the great celebrated ascetic Lomasa and prayed to him for the protection of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira.</div>
<div class="Purport">When his inimical cousin Duryodhana was under the clutches of the Gandharvas, he wanted to save him and requested the Gandharvas to release Duryodhana, but the Gandharvas refused, and thus he fought with them and got Duryodhana released. When all the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas lived incognito, he presented himself in the court of King Vir&#257;&#7789;a as a eunuch and was employed as the musical teacher of Uttar&#257;, his future daughter-in-law, and was known in the Vir&#257;&#7789;a court as the B&#7771;hannala. As B&#7771;hannala, he fought on behalf of Uttara, the son of King Vir&#257;&#7789;a, and thus defeated the Kurus in the fight incognito. His secret weapons were safely kept in the custody of a <span class="Italic">somi</span> tree, and he ordered Uttara to get them back. His identity and his brothers' identity were later on disclosed to Uttara. Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya was informed of Arjuna's presence in the fight of the Kurus and the Vir&#257;&#7789;as. Later, on the Battlefield of Kuruk&#7779;etra, Arjuna killed many great generals like Kar&#7751;a and others. After the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra, he punished A&#347;vatth&#257;m&#257;, who had killed all the five sons of Draupad&#299;. Then all the brothers went to Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva.</div>
<div class="Purport">It is due to Arjuna only that the great philosophical discourses of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> were again spoken by the Lord on the Battlefield of Kuruk&#7779;etra. His wonderful acts on the Battlefield of Kuruk&#7779;etra are vividly described in the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata.</span> Arjuna was defeated, however, by his son Babhruv&#257;hana at Ma&#7751;ipura and fell unconscious when Ul&#363;p&#299; saved him. After the disappearance of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the message was brought by Arjuna to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira. Again, Arjuna visited Dv&#257;rak&#257;, and all the widow wives of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a lamented before him. He took them all in the presence of Vasudeva and pacified all of them. Later on, when Vasudeva passed away, he performed his funeral ceremony in the absence of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. While Arjuna was taking all the wives of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a to Indraprastha, he was attacked on the way, and he could not protect the ladies in his custody. At last, advised by Vy&#257;sadeva, all the brothers headed for Mah&#257;prasthan. On the way, at the request of his brother, he gave up all important weapons as useless, and he dropped them all in the water.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">One is compared to the lion when one is very strong in chasing an enemy. One should be a lamb at home and a lion in the chase. The lion never fails in the chase of an animal; similarly, the head of the state should never fail in chasing an enemy. The Himalaya Mountains are famous for all richness. There are innumerable caves to live in, numberless trees of good fruits to eat, good springs to drink water from and profuse drugs and minerals to cure diseases. Any man who is not materially prosperous can take shelter of these great mountains, and he will be provided with everything required. Both the materialist and the spiritualist can take advantage of the great shelter of the Himalayas. On the surface of the earth there are so many disturbances caused by the inhabitants. In the modern age the people have begun to detonate atomic weapons on the surface of the earth, and still the earth is forbearing to the inhabitants, like a mother who excuses a little child. Parents are always tolerant to children for all sorts of mischievous acts. An ideal king may be possessed of all these good qualities, and the child Par&#299;k&#7779;it is foretold to have all these qualities in perfection.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">This child will be like his grandfather Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira or Brahm&#257; in equanimity of mind. He will be munificent like the lord of the Kail&#257;sa Hill, &#346;iva. And he will be the resort of everyone, like the Supreme Personality of Godhead N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, who is even the shelter of the goddess of fortune.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Mental equanimity refers both to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira and to Brahm&#257;, the grandfather of all living beings. According to &#346;r&#299;dhara Sv&#257;m&#299;, the grandfather referred to is Brahm&#257;, but according to Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299;, the grandfather is Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira himself. But in both cases the comparison is equally good because both of them are recognized representatives of the Supreme Lord, and thus both of them have to maintain mental equanimity, being engaged in welfare work for the living being. Any responsible executive agent at the top of administration has to tolerate different types of onslaughts from the very persons for whom he works. Brahm&#257;j&#299; was criticized even by the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s,</span> the highest perfectional devotees of the Lord. The <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> were dissatisfied with the work of Brahm&#257;j&#299; because Lord Brahm&#257;, as creator of this particular universe, created eyelids which obstructed their seeing Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. They could not tolerate a moment's blinking of the eyes, for it kept them from seeing their beloved Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. So what to speak of others, who are naturally very critical of every action of a responsible man? Similarly, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira had to cross over many difficult situations created by his enemies, and he proved to be the most perfect maintainer of mental equanimity in all critical circumstances. Therefore the example of both grandfathers for maintaining equanimity of mind is quite fitting.</div>
<div class="Purport">Lord &#346;iva is a celebrated demigod who awards gifts to beggars. His name is therefore &#256;&#347;uto&#7779;a, or one who is pleased very easily. He is also called the Bh&#363;tan&#257;tha, or the lord of the common folk, who are mainly attached to him because of his munificent gifts, even without consideration of the aftereffects. R&#257;va&#7751;a was very attached to Lord &#346;iva, and by easily pleasing him, R&#257;va&#7751;a became so powerful that he wanted to challenge the authority of Lord R&#257;ma. Of course, R&#257;va&#7751;a was never helped by Lord &#346;iva when he fought with R&#257;ma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the Lord of Lord &#346;iva. To V&#7771;k&#257;sura, Lord &#346;iva awarded a benediction which was not only awkward, but also disturbing. V&#7771;k&#257;sura became empowered, by the grace of Lord &#346;iva, to vanish anyone's head simply by touching it. Although this was awarded by Lord &#346;iva, the cunning fellow wanted to make an experiment of the power by touching the head of Lord &#346;iva. Thus the lord had to take shelter of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u to save himself from trouble, and the Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, by His illusory potency, asked V&#7771;k&#257;sura to make an experiment with his own head. The fellow did it and was finished himself, and so the world was saved from all sorts of trouble by such a cunning beggar of the demigods. The excellent point is that Lord &#346;iva never denies anyone any sort of gift. He is therefore the most generous, although sometimes some kind of a mistake is made.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Ram&#257;</span> means the goddess of fortune. And her shelter is Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is the maintainer of all living beings. There are innumerable living beings, not only on the surface of this planet but also in all other hundreds of thousands of planets. All of them are provided with all necessities of life for the progressive march towards the end of self-realization, but on the path of sense gratification they are put into difficulty by the agency of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> the illusory energy, and so travel the path of a false plan of economic development. Such economic development is never successful because it is illusory. These men are always after the mercy of the illusory goddess of fortune, but they do not know that the goddess of fortune can live only under the protection of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Without Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the goddess of fortune is an illusion. We should therefore seek the protection of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u instead of directly seeking the protection of the goddess of fortune. Only Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and the devotees of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u can give protection to all, and because Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was himself protected by Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, it was quite possible for him to give complete protection to all who wanted to live under his rule.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The last instruction of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> is that one should give up everything and should follow in the footsteps of the Lord alone. Less intelligent persons do not agree to this great instruction of the Lord, as ill luck would have it, but one who is actually intelligent catches up this sublime instruction and is immensely benefited. Foolish people do not know that association is the cause of acquiring qualities. Association with fire makes an object hot, even in the material sense. Therefore, association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead makes one qualified like the Lord. As we have discussed previously, one can achieve seventy-eight percent of the godly qualities by the Lord's intimate association. To follow the instructions of the Lord is to associate with the Lord. <span class="Italic">The Lord is not a material object whose presence one has to feel for such association.</span> The Lord is present everywhere and at all times. It is quite possible to have His association simply by following His instruction because the Lord and His instruction and the Lord and His name, fame, attributes and paraphernalia are all identical with Him, being absolute knowledge. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it associated with the Lord even from the womb of his mother up to the last day of his valuable life, and thus he acquired all the essential good qualities of the Lord in all perfection.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Rantideva:</span> An ancient king prior to the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> period, referred to by N&#257;rada Muni while instructing Sa&ntilde;jaya, as mentioned in <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Dro&#7751;a-parva</span></B> 67). He was a great king, liberal for hospitality and distribution of foodstuff. Even Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a praised his acts of charity and hospitality. He was blessed by the great Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha Muni for supplying him cold water, and thus he achieved the heavenly planet. He used to supply fruits, roots and leaves to the <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is,</span> and thus he was blessed by them with fulfillment of his desires. <span class="Italic">Although a k&#7779;atriya by birth, he never ate flesh in his life.</span> He was especially hospitable to Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha Muni, and by his blessings only he attained the higher planetary residence. He is one of those pious kings whose names are remembered in the morning and evening.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Yay&#257;ti:</span> The great emperor of the world and the original forefather of all great nations of the world who belong to the &#256;ryan and Indo-European stock. He is the son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Nabu&#7779;a, and he became the emperor of the world due to his elder brother's becoming a great and liberated saintly mystic. He ruled over the world for several thousands of years and performed many sacrifices and pious activities recorded in history, although his early youth was very lustful and full of romantic stories. He fell in love with Devay&#257;n&#299;, the most beloved daughter of &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya. Devay&#257;n&#299; wished to marry him, but at first he refused to accept her because of her being a daughter of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> According to <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras,</span> a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> could marry the daughter of a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> but a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> could not marry the daughter of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> They were very much cautious about <span class="Italic">var&#7751;a-sa&#7749;kara</span> population in the world. &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya amended this law of forbidden marriage and induced Emperor Yay&#257;ti to accept Devay&#257;n&#299;. Devay&#257;n&#299; had a girl friend named &#346;armi&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;, who also fell in love with the emperor and thus went with her friend Devay&#257;n&#299;. &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya forbade Emperor Yay&#257;ti to call &#346;armi&#7779;&#7789;h&#257; into his bedroom, but Yay&#257;ti could not strictly follow his instruction. He secretly married &#346;armi&#7779;&#7789;h&#257; also and begot sons by her. When this was known by Devay&#257;n&#299;, she went to her father and lodged a complaint. Yay&#257;ti was much attached to Devay&#257;n&#299;, and when he went to his father-in-law's place to call her, &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya was angry with him and cursed him to become impotent. Yay&#257;ti begged his father-in-law to withdraw his curse, but the sage asked Yay&#257;ti to ask youthfulness from his sons and let them become old as the condition of his becoming potent. He had five sons, two from Devay&#257;n&#299; and three from &#346;armi&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;. From his five sons, namely (1) Yadu, (2) Turvasu, (3) Druhyu, (4) Anu and (5) P&#363;ru, five famous dynasties, namely (1) the Yadu dynasty, (2) the Yavana (Turk) dynasty, (3) the Bhoja dynasty, (4) the Mleccha dynasty (Greek) and (5) the Paurava dynasty, all emanated to spread all over the world. He reached the heavenly planets by dint of his pious acts, but he fell down from there because of his self-advertisement and criticizing other great souls. After his fall, his daughter and grandson bestowed upon him their accumulated virtues, and by the help of his grandson and friend &#346;ibi, he was again promoted to the heavenly kingdom, becoming one of the assembly members of Yamar&#257;ja, with whom he is staying as a devotee. He performed more than one thousand different sacrifices, gave in charity very liberally and was a very influential king. His majestic power was felt all over the world. His youngest son agreed to award him his youthfulness when he was troubled with lustful desires, even for one thousand years. Finally he became detached from worldly life and returned the youthfulness again to his son P&#363;ru. He wanted to hand over the kingdom to P&#363;ru, but his noblemen and the subjects did not agree. But when he explained to his subjects the greatness of P&#363;ru, they agreed to accept P&#363;ru as the King, and thus Emperor Yay&#257;ti retired from family life and left home for the forest.</div>

Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja is a great authority in devotional service because he sacrificed everything to please the Lord and relinquished the connection of his so-called spiritual master who obstructed him on the path of risking everything for the service of the Lord. The highest perfection of religious life is to attain to the stage of unqualified devotional service of the Lord without any cause or without being obstructed by any kind of worldly obligation. Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was determined to give up everything for the satisfaction of the Lord, and he did not care for any obstruction whatsoever.

Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was an authority in the devotional service of the Lord because he had his father killed by Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva, setting the example that even a father should be removed from the path of devotional service if such a father happens to be an obstacle. He had four sons, and the eldest son, Virocana, is the father of Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, mentioned above.

<div class="First">The wisest man in the world is a devotee of the Lord. The sages are called wise men, and there are different types of wise men for different branches of knowledge. Unless, therefore, the king or the head of the state is the wisest man, he cannot control all types of wise men in the state. In the line of royal succession in the family of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, all the kings, without exception, were the wisest men of their times, and so also it is foretold about Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it and his son Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Janamejaya, who was yet to be born. Such wise kings can become chastisers of upstarts and uprooters of Kali, or quarrelsome elements. As will be clear in the chapters ahead, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it wanted to kill the personified Kali, who was attempting to kill a cow, the emblem of peace and religion. The symptoms of Kali are (1) wine, (2) women, (3) gambling and (4) slaughterhouses. Wise rulers of all states should take lessons from Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it in how to maintain peace and morality by subduing the upstarts and quarrelsome people who indulge in wine, illicit connection with women, gambling and meat-eating supplied by regularly maintained slaughterhouses. In this age of Kali, regular license is issued for maintaining all of these different departments of quarrel. So how can they expect peace and morality in the state? The state fathers, therefore, must follow the principles of becoming wiser by devotion to the Lord, by chastising the breaker of discipline and by uprooting the symptoms of quarrel, as mentioned above. If we want blazing fire, we must use dry fuel. Blazing fire and moist fuel go ill together. Peace and morality can prosper only by the principles of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it and his followers.</div>

Without self-realization, philosophy is dry speculation or a waste of time and energy. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> gives the right knowledge of one's own self, and by hearing <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> one can get free from material attachment and enter into the kingdom of fearlessness. This material world is fearfulness. Its prisoners are always fearful as within a prison house. In the prison house no one can violate the jail rules and regulations, and violating the rules means another term for extension of prison life. Similarly, we in this material existence are always fearful. This fearfulness is called anxiety. Everyone in the material life, in all species and varieties of life, is full of anxieties, either by breaking or without breaking the laws of nature. Liberation, or <span class="Italic">mukti,</span> means getting relief from these constant anxieties. This is possible only when the anxiety is changed to the devotional service of the Lord. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> gives us the chance to change the quality of anxiety from matter to spirit. This is done in the association of a learned philosopher like the self-realized &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, the great son of &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, after receiving warning of his death, took advantage of this opportunity by association with &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; and achieved the desired result.</div>

<div class="First">The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are the storehouse of knowledge, both material and spiritual. But such knowledge aims at perfection of self-realization. In other words, the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are the guides for the civilized man in every respect. Since human life is the opportunity to get free from all material miseries, it is properly guided by the knowledge of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> in the matters of both material needs and spiritual salvation. The specific intelligent class of men who were devoted particularly to the knowledge of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> were called the <span class="Italic">vipras,</span> or the graduates of the Vedic knowledge. There are different branches of knowledge in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> of which astrology and pathology are two important branches necessary for the common man. So the intelligent men, generally known as the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> took up all the different branches of Vedic knowledge to guide society. Even the department of military education (<span class="Italic">Dhanur-veda</span>) was also taken up by such intelligent men, and the <span class="Italic">vipras</span> were also teachers of this section of knowledge, as were Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya, K&#7771;p&#257;c&#257;rya, etc.</div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">vipra</span> mentioned herein is significant.

There is a practical example in my personal life in this connection. My father was a pure devotee of the Lord, and when I was only four or five years old, my father gave me a couple of forms of R&#257;dh&#257; and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. In a playful manner, I used to worship these Deities along with my sister, and I used to imitate the performances of a neighboring temple of R&#257;dh&#257;-Govinda. By constantly visiting this neighboring temple and copying the ceremonies in connection with my own Deities of play, I developed a natural affinity for the Lord. My father used to observe all the ceremonies befitting my position. Later on, these activities were suspended due to my association in the schools and colleges, and I became completely out of practice. But in my youthful days, when I met my spiritual master, &#346;r&#299; &#346;r&#299;mad Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; Gosv&#257;m&#299; Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, again I revived my old habit, and the same playful Deities became my worshipful Deities in proper regulation. This was followed up until I left the family connection, and I am pleased that my generous father gave the first impression which was developed later into regulative devotional service by His Divine Grace. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Prahl&#257;da also advised that such impressions of a godly relation must be impregnated from the beginning of childhood, otherwise one may miss the opportunity of the human form of life, which is very valuable although it is temporary like others.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"><span class="Italic">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Marutta:</span> one of the great emperors of the world. He reigned over the world long before the reign of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira. He was the son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Avik&#7779;it and was a great devotee of the son of the sun-god, known as Yamar&#257;ja. His brother Samvarta was a rival priest of the great B&#7771;haspati, the learned priest of the demigods. He conducted one sacrifice called Sa&#7749;k&#257;ra-yaj&ntilde;a by which the Lord was so satisfied that He was pleased to hand over to him the charge of a mountain peak of gold. This peak of gold is somewhere in the Himalaya Mountains, and modern adventurers may try to find it there. He was so powerful an emperor that at the day's end of sacrifice, the demigods from the other planets like Indra, Candra and B&#7771;haspati used to visit his palace. And because he had the gold peak at his disposal, he had sufficient gold in his possession. The canopy of the sacrificial altar was completely made of gold. in his daily performances of the sacrificial ceremonies, some of the inhabitants of the V&#257;yuloka (airy planets) were invited to expedite the cooking work of the ceremony. And the assembly of the demigods in the ceremony was led by Vi&#347;vadeva.</div>
<div class="Purport">By his constant pious work he was able to drive out all kinds of diseases from the jurisdiction of his kingdom. All the inhabitants of higher planets like Devaloka and Pit&#7771;loka were pleased with him for his great sacrificial ceremonies. Every day he used to give in charity to the learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> such things as beddings, seats, conveyances and sufficient quantities of gold. Because of munificent charities and performances of innumerable sacrifices, the King of heaven, Indradeva, was fully satisfied with him and always wished for his welfare. Due to his pious activities, he remained a young man throughout his life and reigned over the world for one thousand years, surrounded by his satisfied subjects, ministers, legitimate wife, sons and brothers. Even Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a praised his spirit of pious activities. He handed over his only daughter to Mahar&#7779;i A&#7749;gir&#257;, and by his good blessings, he was elevated to the kingdom of heaven. First of all, he wanted to offer the priesthood of his sacrifices to learned B&#7771;haspati, but the demigod refused to accept the post because of the King's being a human being, a man of this earth. He was very sorry for this, but on the advice of N&#257;rada Muni he appointed Samvarta to the post, and he was successful in his mission.</div>
<div class="Purport">The success of a particular type of sacrifice completely depends on the priest in charge. In this age, all kinds of sacrifice are forbidden because there is no learned priest amongst the so-called <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> who go by the false notion of becoming sons of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> without brahminical qualifications.

<div class="Translation">By those riches, the King could procure the ingredients for three horse sacrifices. Thus the pious King Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, who was very fearful after the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra, pleased Lord Hari, the Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira was the ideal and celebrated pious King of the world, and still he was greatly afraid after the execution of the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra because of the mass killing in the fight, all of which was done only to install him on the throne. He therefore took all the responsibility for sins committed in the warfare, and to get rid of all these sins, he wanted to perform three sacrifices in which horses are offered at the altar. Such a sacrifice is very costly. Even Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira had to collect the necessary heaps of gold left by Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Marutta and the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> who were given gold in charity by King Marutta. The learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> could not take away all the loads of gold given by Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Marutta, and therefore they left behind the major portion of the gift. And Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Marutta also did not again collect such heaps of gold given away in charity. Besides that, all the golden plates and utensils which were used in the sacrifice were also thrown in the dustbins, and all such heaps of gold remained unclaimed property for a long time, till Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira collected them for his own purposes. Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a advised the brothers of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira to collect the unclaimed property because it belonged to the King. The more astonishing thing is that no subject of the state also collected such unclaimed gold for industrial enterprise or anything like that. This means that the state citizens were completely satisfied with all necessities of life and therefore not inclined to accept unnecessary productive enterprises for sense gratification. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira also requisitioned the heaps of gold for performing sacrifices and for pleasing the Supreme Hari Personality of Godhead. Otherwise he had no desire to collect them for the state treasury.</div>
<div class="Purport">One should take lessons from the acts of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira. He was afraid of sins committed on the battlefield, and therefore he wanted to satisfy the supreme authority. This indicates that unintentional sins are also committed in our daily occupational discharge of duties, and to counteract even such unintentional crimes, one must perform sacrifices as they are recommended in the revealed scriptures. The Lord says in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;&#257;rth&#257;t karma&#7751;o 'nyatra loko 'ya&#7745; karma-bandhana&#7717; </I> [</I>Bg</I>. </I><a href="indexde01.html?g=1113">3.9</a></I>]</span></I>) that one must perform sacrifices recommended in the scriptures in order to get rid of commitments of all unauthorized work, or even unintentional crimes which we are apt to commit. By doing so, one shall be freed from all kinds of sins. And those who do not do so but work for self-interest or sense gratification have to undergo all tribulations accrued from committed sins. Therefore, the main purpose of performing sacrifices is to satisfy the Supreme Personality Hari. The process of performing sacrifices may be different in terms of different times, places and persons, but the aim of such sacrifices is one and the same at all times and in all circumstances, <span class="Italic">viz.</span> <span class="Italic">,</span> satisfaction of the Supreme Lord Hari. That is the way of pious life, and that is the way of peace and prosperity in the world at large. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira did all these as the ideal pious king in the world.</div>
<div class="Purport">If Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira is a sinner in his daily discharge of duties, in royal administration of state affairs, wherein killing of man and animals is a recognized art, then we can just imagine the amount of sins committed consciously or unconsciously by the untrained population of the Kali-yuga who have no way to perform sacrifice to please the Supreme Lord. The <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> says, therefore, that the prime duty of the human being is to satisfy the Supreme Lord by the performance of one's occupational duty (<span class="Ref_Italic">SB</span> <a href="index135e.html?g=6442">1.2.13</a>).</div>
<div class="Purport">Let any man of any place or community, caste or creed be engaged in any sort of occupational duty, but he must agree to perform sacrifices as it is recommended in the scriptures for the particular place, time and person. In the Vedic literatures it is recommended that in Kali-yuga people engage in glorifying the Lord by chanting the holy name of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (<span class="Italic">k&#299;rtan&#257;d eva k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;asya mukta-sa&#7749;ga&#7717; para&#7745; vrajet </I>[</I>SB</I> </span></I><a href="indexdfd4.html?g=28200">3.31.1</a>]) without offense. By doing so one can be freed from all sins and thus can attain the highest perfection of life by returning home, back to Godhead. We have already discussed this more than once in this great literature in different places, especially in the introductory portion by sketching the life of Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, and still we are repeating the same with a view to bring about peace and prosperity in society.</div>
<div class="Purport">The Lord has declared openly in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> how He becomes pleased with us, and the same process is practically demonstrated in the life and preaching work of Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. The perfect process of performing <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;as,</span> or sacrifice, to please the Supreme Lord Hari (the Personality of Godhead, who gets us free from all miseries of existence) is to follow the ways of Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu in this dark age of quarrel and dissension.</div>
<div class="Purport">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira had to collect heaps of gold to secure the paraphernalia for the horse sacrifice <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;as</span> in days of sufficiency, so we can hardly think of such performance of <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;as</span> in these days of insufficiency and complete scarcity of gold. At the present moment we have heaps of papers and promises of their being converted into gold by economic development of modern civilization, and still there is no possibility of spending riches like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, either individually or collectively or by state patronization. Just suitable, therefore, for the age, is the method recommended by Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu in terms of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra.</span> Such a method requires no expenditure at all and yet can award more benefit than other expensive methods of <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a</span> performances.</div>
<div class="Purport">The horse sacrifice <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a</span> or cow sacrifice <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a</span> performed by the Vedic regulations shouldn't be misunderstood as a process of killing animals. On the contrary, animals offered for the <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a</span> were rejuvenated to a new span of life by the transcendental power of chanting the Vedic hymns, which, if properly chanted, are different from what is understood by the common layman. The <span class="Italic">Veda-mantras</span> are all practical, and the proof is rejuvenation of the sacrificed animal.</div>
<div class="Purport">There is no possibility of such methodical chanting of the Vedic hymns by the so-called <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> or priests of the present age. The untrained descendants of the twice-born families are no more like their forefathers, and thus they are counted amongst the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras,</span> or once-born men. The once-born man is unfit to chant the Vedic hymns, and therefore there is no practical utility of chanting the original hymns.</div>
<div class="Purport">And to save them all, Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu propounded the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> movement or <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a</span> for all practical purposes, and the people of the present age are strongly recommended to follow this sure and recognized path.</div>

The <span class="Italic">muni</span> thought it unwise on the part of Yamar&#257;ja that he was punished for his childish innocence, and thus the <span class="Italic">muni</span> cursed Yamar&#257;ja to become a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra,</span> and this <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> incarnation of Yamar&#257;ja was known as Vidura, the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> brother of Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u. But this <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> son of the Kuru dynasty was equally treated by Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva, along with his other nephews, and in due course Vidura was married with a girl who was also born in the womb of a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dr&#257;&#7751;&#299;</span> by a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> Although Vidura did not inherit the property of his father (the brother of Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva), still he was given sufficient state property by Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra, the elder brother of Vidura. Vidura was very much attached to his elder brother, and all along he tried to guide him on the right path. During the fratricidal war of Kuruk&#7779;etra, Vidura repeatedly implored his elder brother to do justice to the sons of P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u, but Duryodhana did not like such interference by his uncle, and thus he practically insulted Vidura. This resulted in Vidura's leaving home for pilgrimage and taking instructions from Maitreya.</div>

<div class="Translation">After asking various questions and becoming established in the transcendental loving service of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Vidura retired from putting questions to Maitreya Muni.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Vidura retired from putting questions before Maitreya Muni when he was convinced by Maitreya &#7770;&#7779;i that the <span class="Italic">summum bonum</span> of life is to be finally situated in the transcendental loving service of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who is Govinda, or one who satisfies His devotees in all respects. The conditioned soul, the living being in material existence, seeks happiness by employing his senses in the modes of materialism, but that cannot give him satisfaction. He then searches after the Supreme Truth by the empiric philosophic speculative method and intellectual feats. But if he does not find the ultimate goal, he again goes down to material activities and engages himself in various philanthropic and altruistic works, which all fail to give him satisfaction. So neither fruitive activities nor dry philosophical speculation can give one satisfaction because by nature a living being is the eternal servitor of the Supreme Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and all the Vedic literatures give him direction towards that ultimate end. The <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a>) confirms this statement.</div>
<div class="Purport">Like Vidura, an inquisitive conditioned soul must approach a bona fide spiritual master like Maitreya and by intelligent inquiries must try to know everything about <span class="Italic">karma</span> (fruitive activities), <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na</span> (philosophical research for the Supreme Truth) and <span class="Italic">yoga</span> (the linking process of spiritual realization). One who is not seriously inclined to put questions before a spiritual master need not accommodate a show-bottle spiritual master, nor should a person who may be a spiritual master for others pose to be so if he is unable to engage his disciple ultimately in the transcendental loving service of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Vidura was successful in approaching such a spiritual master like Maitreya, and he got the ultimate goal of life: <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> unto Govinda. Thus there was nothing to be known further about spiritual progress.</div>

<div class="Translation">When they saw Vidura return to the palace, all the inhabitants-Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, his younger brothers, Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra, S&#257;tyaki, Sa&ntilde;jaya, K&#7771;p&#257;c&#257;rya, Kunt&#299;, G&#257;ndh&#257;r&#299;, Draupad&#299;, Subhadr&#257;, Uttar&#257;, K&#7771;p&#299;, many other wives of the Kauravas, and other ladies with children-all hurried to him in great delight. It so appeared that they had regained their consciousness after a long period.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"><span class="Italic">G&#257;ndh&#257;r&#299;:</span> The ideal chaste lady in the history of the world. She was the daughter of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Subala, the King of G&#257;ndh&#257;ra (now Kandahar in Kabul), and in her maiden state she worshiped Lord &#346;iva. Lord &#346;iva is generally worshiped by Hindu maidens to get a good husband. G&#257;ndh&#257;r&#299; satisfied Lord &#346;iva, and by his benediction to obtain one hundred sons, she was betrothed to Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra, despite his being blind forever. When G&#257;ndh&#257;r&#299; came to know that her would-be husband was a blind man, to follow her life companion she decided to become voluntarily blind. So she wrapped up her eyes with many silk linens, and she was married to Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra under the guidance of her elder brother &#346;akuni. She was the most beautiful girl of her time, and she was equally qualified by her womanly qualities, which endeared every member of the Kaurava court. But despite all her good qualities, she had the natural frailties of a woman, and she was envious of Kunt&#299; when the latter gave birth to a male child. Both the queens were pregnant, but Kunt&#299; first gave birth to a male child. Thus G&#257;ndh&#257;r&#299; became angry and gave a blow to her own abdomen. As a result, she gave birth to a lump of flesh only, but since she was a devotee of Vy&#257;sadeva, by the instruction of Vy&#257;sadeva the lump was divided into one hundred parts, and each part gradually developed to become a male child. Thus her ambition to become the mother of one hundred sons was fulfilled, and she began to nourish all the children according to her exalted position. When the intrigue of the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra was going on, she was not in favor of fighting with the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas; rather, she blamed Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra, her husband, for such a fratricidal war. She desired that the state be divided into two parts, for the sons of P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u and her own. She was very affected when all her sons died in the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra, and she wanted to curse Bh&#299;masena and Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, but she was checked by Vy&#257;sadeva. Her mourning over the death of Duryodhana and Du&#7717;&#347;&#257;sana before Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was very pitiful, and Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a pacified her by transcendental messages. She was equally aggrieved on the death of Kar&#7751;a, and she described to Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a the lamentation of Kar&#7751;a's wife. She was pacified by &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva when he showed her dead sons, then promoted to the heavenly kingdoms. She died along with her husband in the jungles of the Himalayas near the mouth of the Ganges; she burned in a forest fire. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira performed the death ceremony of his uncle and aunt.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">P&#7771;th&#257;:</span> Daughter of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#346;&#363;rasena and sister of Vasudeva, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's father. Later she was adopted by Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Kuntibhoja, and hence she is known as Kunt&#299;. She is the incarnation of the success potency of the Personality of Godhead. The heavenly denizens from the upper planets used to visit the palace of King Kuntibhoja, and Kunt&#299; was engaged for their reception. She also served the great mystic sage Durv&#257;s&#257;, and being satisfied by her faithful service, Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni gave her a <span class="Italic">mantra</span> by which it was possible for her to call for any demigod she pleased. As a matter of inquisitiveness, she at once called for the sun-god, who desired couplement with her, but she declined. But the sun-god assured her immunity from virgin adulteration, and so she agreed to his proposal. As a result of this couplement, she became pregnant, and Kar&#7751;a was born by her. By the grace of the sun, she again turned into a virgin girl, but being afraid of her parents, she quitted the newly born child, Kar&#7751;a. After that, when she actually selected her own husband, she preferred P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u to be her husband. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u later wanted to retire from family life and adopt the renounced order of life. Kunt&#299; refused to allow her husband to adopt such life, but at last Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u gave her permission to become a mother of sons by calling some other suitable personalities. Kunt&#299; did not accept this proposal at first, but when vivid examples were set by P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u she agreed. Thus by dint of the <span class="Italic">mantra</span> awarded by Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni she called for Dharmar&#257;ja, and thus Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira was born. She called for the demigod V&#257;yu (air), and thus Bh&#299;ma was born. She called for Indra, the King of heaven, and thus Arjuna was born. The other two sons, namely Nakula and Sahadeva, were begotten by P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u himself in the womb of M&#257;dr&#299;. Later on, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u died at an early age, for which Kunt&#299; was so aggrieved that she fainted. Two co-wives, namely Kunt&#299; and M&#257;dr&#299;, decided that Kunt&#299; should live for the maintenance of the five minor children, the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, and M&#257;dr&#299; should accept the <span class="Italic">sat&#299;</span> rituals by meeting voluntary death along with her husband. This agreement was endorsed by great sages like &#346;atas&#7771;&#7749;ga and others present on the occasion.</div>
<div class="Purport">Later on, when the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas were banished from the kingdom by the intrigues of Duryodhana, Kunt&#299; followed her sons, and she equally faced all sorts of difficulties during those days. During the forest life one demon girl, Hi&#7693;imb&#257;, wanted Bh&#299;ma as her husband. Bh&#299;ma refused, but when the girl approached Kunt&#299; and Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, they ordered Bh&#299;ma to accept her proposal and give her a son. As a result of this combination, Gha&#7789;otkaca was born, and he fought very valiantly with his father against the Kauravas. In their forest life they lived with a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> family that was in trouble because of one Bak&#257;sura demon, and Kunt&#299; ordered Bh&#299;ma to kill the Bak&#257;sura to protect the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> family against troubles created by the demon. She advised Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira to start for the P&#257;&ntilde;c&#257;lade&#347;a. Draupad&#299; was gained in this P&#257;&ntilde;c&#257;lade&#347;a by Arjuna, but by order of Kunt&#299; all five of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ava brothers became equally the husbands of P&#257;&ntilde;c&#257;l&#299;, or Draupad&#299;. She was married with five P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas in the presence of Vy&#257;sadeva. Kunt&#299;dev&#299; never forgot her first child, Kar&#7751;a, and after Kar&#7751;a's death in the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra she lamented and admitted before her other sons that Kar&#7751;a was her eldest son prior to her marriage with Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u. Her prayers for the Lord after the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra, when Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was going back home, are excellently explained. Later she went to the forest with G&#257;ndh&#257;r&#299; for severe penance. She used to take meals after each thirty days. She finally sat down in profound meditation and later burned to ashes in a forest fire.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Draupad&#299;:</span> The most chaste daughter of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Drupada and partly an incarnation of goddess &#346;ac&#299;, the wife of Indra. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Drupada performed a great sacrifice under the superintendence of the sage Yaja. By his first offering, Dh&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;adyumna was born, and by the second offering, Draupad&#299; was born. She is therefore the sister of Dh&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;adyumna, and she is also named P&#257;&ntilde;c&#257;l&#299;. The five P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas married her as a common wife, and each of them begot a son in her. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira begot a son named Pratibhit, Bh&#299;masena begot a son named Sutasoma, Arjuna begot &#346;rutak&#299;rti, Nakula begot &#346;at&#257;n&#299;ka, and Sahadeva begot &#346;rutakarm&#257;. She is described as a most beautiful lady, equal to her mother-in-law, Kunt&#299;. During her birth there was an aero-message that she should be called K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;&#257;. The same message also declared that she was born to kill many a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya.</span> By dint of her blessings from &#346;a&#7749;kara, she was awarded five husbands, equally qualified. When she preferred to select her own husband, princes and kings were invited from all the countries of the world. She was married with the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas during their exile in the forest, but when they went back home Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Drupada gave them immense wealth as a dowry. She was well received by all the daughters-in-law of Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra. When she was lost in a gambling game, she was forcibly dragged into the assembly hall, and an attempt was made by Du&#7717;&#347;&#257;sana to see her naked beauty, even though there were elderly persons like Bh&#299;&#7779;ma and Dro&#7751;a present. She was a great devotee of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and by her praying, the Lord Himself became an unlimited garment to save her from the insult. A demon of the name Jat&#257;sura kidnapped her, but her second husband, Bh&#299;masena, killed the demon and saved her. She saved the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas from the curse of Mahar&#7779;i Durv&#257;s&#257; by the grace of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. When the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas lived incognito in the palace of Vir&#257;&#7789;a, K&#299;caka was attracted by her exquisite beauty, and by arrangement with Bh&#299;ma the devil was killed and she was saved. She was very much aggrieved when her five sons were killed by A&#347;vatth&#257;m&#257;. At the last stage, she accompanied her husband Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira and others and fell on the way. The cause of her falling was explained by Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, but when Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira entered the heavenly planet he saw Draupad&#299; gloriously present there as the goddess of fortune in the heavenly planet.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Subhadr&#257;:</span> Daughter of Vasudeva and sister of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. She was not only a very dear daughter of Vasudeva, but also a very dear sister to both K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and Baladeva. The two brothers and sister are represented in the famous Jagann&#257;tha temple of Pur&#299;, and the temple is still visited by thousands of pilgrims daily. This temple is in remembrance of the Lord's visit at Kuruk&#7779;etra during an occasion of solar eclipse and His subsequent meeting with the residents of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana. The meeting of R&#257;dh&#257; and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a during this occasion is a very pathetic story, and Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya, in the ecstasy of R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;&#7751;&#299;, always pined for Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a at Jagann&#257;tha Pur&#299;. While Arjuna was at Dv&#257;rak&#257;, he wanted to have Subhadr&#257; as his queen, and he expressed his desire to Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a knew that His elder brother, Lord Baladeva, was arranging her marriage elsewhere, and since He did not dare to go against the arrangement of Baladeva, He advised Arjuna to kidnap Subhadr&#257;. So when all of them were on a pleasure trip on the Raivata Hill, Arjuna managed to kidnap Subhadr&#257; according to the plan of &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. &#346;r&#299; Baladeva was very angry at Arjuna, and He wanted to kill him, but Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a implored His brother to excuse Arjuna. Then Subhadr&#257; was duly married with Arjuna, and Abhimanyu was born of Subhadr&#257;. At the premature death of Abhimanyu, Subhadr&#257; was very mortified, but on the birth of Par&#299;k&#7779;it she was happy and solaced.</div>

After that, bathing and arrangements for a sumptuous dinner were made, and then he was given sufficient rest. After finishing his rest, he was offered a comfortable place to sit, and then the King began to talk about all happenings, both family and otherwise. That is the proper way to receive a beloved friend, or even an enemy. According to Indian moral codes, even an enemy received at home should be so well received that he will not feel any fearful situation. An enemy is always afraid of his enemy, but this should not be so when he is received at home by his enemy. This means that a person, when received at home, should be treated as a relative, so what to speak of a family member like Vidura, who was a well-wisher for all the members of the family. Thus Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira Mah&#257;r&#257;ja began to speak in the presence of all the other members.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Due to P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u's death at an early age, his minor children and widow were the object of special care by all the elderly members of the family, especially Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva and Mah&#257;tm&#257; Vidura. Vidura was more or less partial to the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas due to their political position. Although Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra was equally careful for the minor children of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u, he was one of the intriguing parties who wanted to wash away the descendants of P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u and replace them by raising his own sons to become the rulers of the kingdom. Mah&#257;tm&#257; Vidura could follow this intrigue of Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra and company, and therefore, even though he was a faithful servitor of his eldest brother, Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra, he did not like his political ambition for the sake of his own sons. He was therefore very careful about the protection of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas and their widow mother. Thus he was, so to speak, partial to the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, preferring them to the sons of Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra, although both of them were equally affectionate in his ordinary eyes. He was equally affectionate to both the camps of nephews in the sense that he always chastised Duryodhana for his intriguing policy against his cousins. He always criticized his elder brother for his policy of encouragement to his sons, and at the same time he was always alert in giving special protection to the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas. All these different activities of Vidura within the palace politics made him well-known as partial to the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira has referred to the past history of Vidura before his going away from home for a prolonged pilgrim's journey. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira reminded him that he was equally kind and partial to his grown-up nephews, even after the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra, a great family disaster.</div>
<div class="Purport">Before the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra, Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra's policy was peaceful annihilation of his nephews, and therefore he ordered Purocana to build a house at V&#257;ra&#7751;&#257;vata, and when the building was finished Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra desired that his brother's family live there for some time. When the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas were going there in the presence of all the members of the royal family, Vidura tactfully gave instructions to the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas about the future plan of Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra. This is specifically described in the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic"></B>&#256;di-parva</span></B> 114). He indirectly hinted, "A weapon not made of steel or any other material element can be more than sharp to kill an enemy, and he who knows this is never killed." That is to say, he hinted that the party of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas was being sent to V&#257;ra&#7751;&#257;vata to be killed, and thus he warned Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira to be very careful in their new residential palace. He also gave indications of fire and said that fire cannot extinguish the soul but can annihilate the material body. But one who protects the soul can live. Kunt&#299; could not follow such indirect conversations between Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira and Vidura, and thus when she inquired from her son about the purport of the conversation, Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira replied that from the talks of Vidura it was understood that there was a hint of fire in the house where they were proceeding. Later on, Vidura came in disguise to the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas and informed them that the housekeeper was going to set fire to the house on the fourteenth night of the waning moon. It was an intrigue of Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra that the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas might die all together with their mother. And by his warning the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas escaped through a tunnel underneath the earth so that their escape was also unknown to Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra, so much so that after setting the fire, the Kauravas were so certain of the death of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas that Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra performed the last rites of death with great cheerfulness. And during the mourning period all the members of the palace became overwhelmed with lamentation, but Vidura did not become so, because of his knowledge that the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas were alive somewhere. There are many such instances of calamities, and in each of them Vidura gave protection to the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas on one hand, and on the other he tried to restrain his brother Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra from such intriguing policies. Therefore, he was always partial to the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, just as a bird protects its eggs by its wing.</div>

<div class="First">Vidura went out from the palace to detach himself from household affairs, especially political intrigues. As referred to hereinbefore, he was practically insulted by Duryodhana's calling him a son of a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dr&#257;&#7751;&#299;,</span> although it was not out of place to talk loosely in the case of one's grandmother. Vidura's mother, although a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dr&#257;&#7751;&#299;,</span> was the grandmother of Duryodhana, and funny talks are sometimes allowed between grandmother and grandchildren. But because the remark was an actual fact, it was unpalatable talk to Vidura, and it was accepted as a direct insult. He therefore decided to quit his paternal house and prepare for the renounced order of life. This preparatory stage is called <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha-&#257;&#347;rama,</span> or retired life for traveling and visiting the holy places on the surface of the earth. In the holy places of India, like V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, Hardwar, Jagann&#257;tha Pur&#299;, and Pray&#257;ga, there are many great devotees, and there are still free kitchen houses for persons who desire to advance spiritually. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira was inquisitive to learn whether Vidura maintained himself by the mercy of the free kitchen houses (<span class="Italic">chatras</span>).</div>

<div class="First">The Personality of Godhead is omnipresent by His diverse potencies everywhere, just as the power of electricity is distributed everywhere within space. Similarly, the Lord's omnipresence is perceived and manifested by His unalloyed devotees like Vidura, just as electricity is manifested in an electric bulb. A pure devotee like Vidura always feels the presence of the Lord everywhere. He sees everything in the potency of the Lord and the Lord in everything. The holy places all over the earth are meant for purifying the polluted consciousness of the human being by an atmosphere surcharged with the presence of the Lord's unalloyed devotees. If anyone visits a holy place, he must search out the pure devotees residing in such holy places, take lessons from them, try to apply such instructions in practical life and thus gradually prepare oneself for the ultimate salvation, going back to Godhead. To go to some holy place of pilgrimage does not mean only to take a bath in the Ganges or Yamun&#257; or to visit the temples situated in those places. One should also find representatives of Vidura who have no desire in life save and except to serve the Personality of Godhead. The Personality of Godhead is always with such pure devotees because of their unalloyed service, which is without any tinge of fruitive action or utopian speculation. They are in the actual service of the Lord, specifically by the process of hearing and chanting. The pure devotees hear from the authorities and chant, sing and write of the glories of the Lord. Mah&#257;muni Vy&#257;sadeva heard from N&#257;rada, and then he chanted in writing; &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; studied from his father, and he described it to Par&#299;k&#7779;it; that is the way of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> So by their actions the pure devotees of the Lord can render any place into a place of pilgrimage, and the holy places are worth the name only on their account. Such pure devotees are able to rectify the polluted atmosphere of any place, and what to speak of a holy place rendered unholy by the questionable actions of interested persons who try to adopt a professional life at the cost of the reputation of a holy place.</div>

<div class="First">The particular word <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-devat&#257;&#7717;,</span> i.e., those who are always rapt in the service of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, is significant. The Y&#257;davas and the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, who were always rapt in the thought of the Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and His different transcendental activities, were all pure devotees of the Lord like Vidura. Vidura left home in order to devote himself completely to the service of the Lord, but the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas and the Y&#257;davas were always rapt in the thought of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Thus there is no difference in their pure devotional qualities. Either remaining at home or leaving home, the real qualification of a pure devotee is to become rapt in the thought of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a favorably, i.e., knowing well that Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the Absolute Personality of Godhead. Ka&#7745;sa, Jar&#257;sandha, &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la and other demons like them were also always rapt in the thought of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, but they were absorbed in a different way, namely unfavorably, or thinking Him to be a powerful man only. Therefore, Ka&#7745;sa and &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la are not on the same level as pure devotees like Vidura, the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas and the Y&#257;davas.</div>

Otherwise he could not have asked all about them from Vidura.

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Thus Mah&#257;tm&#257; Vidura, being treated just like a godly person by his kinsmen, remained there for a certain period just to rectify the mentality of his eldest brother and in this way bring happiness to all the others.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Saintly persons like Vidura must be treated as well as a denizen from heaven. In those days denizens of heavenly planets used to visit homes like that of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, and sometimes persons like Arjuna and others used to visit higher planets. N&#257;rada is a spaceman who can travel unrestrictedly, not only within the material universes but also in the spiritual universes. Even N&#257;rada used to visit the palace of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira and what to speak of other celestial demigods. It is only the spiritual culture of the people concerned that makes interplanetary travel possible, even in the present body. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira therefore received Vidura in the manner of reception offered to the demigods.</div>
<div class="Purport">Mah&#257;tm&#257; Vidura had already adopted the renounced order of life, and therefore he did not return to his paternal palace to enjoy some material comforts. He accepted out of his own mercy what was offered to him by Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, but the purpose of living in the palace was to deliver his elder brother, Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra, who was too much materially attached. Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra lost all his state and descendants in the fight with Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, and still, due to his sense of helplessness, he did not feel ashamed to accept the charity and hospitality of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira. On the part of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, it was quite in order to maintain his uncle in a befitting manner, but acceptance of such magnanimous hospitality by Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra was not at all desirable. He accepted it because he thought that there was no alternative. Vidura particularly came to enlighten Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra and to give him a lift to the higher status of spiritual cognition. It is the duty of enlightened souls to deliver the fallen ones, and Vidura came for that reason. But talks of spiritual enlightenment are so refreshing that while instructing Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra, Vidura attracted the attention of all the members of the family, and all of them took pleasure in hearing him patiently. This is the way of spiritual realization. The message should be heard attentively, and if spoken by a realized soul, it will act on the dormant heart of the conditioned soul. And by continuously hearing, one can attain the perfect stage of self-realization.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Vidura, born in the womb of a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> woman, was forbidden even to be a party of royal heritage along with his brothers Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra and P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u. Then how could he occupy the post of a preacher to instruct such learned kings and <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> as Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira? The first answer is that even though it is accepted that he was a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> by birth, because he renounced the world for spiritual enlightenment by the authority of &#7770;&#7779;i Maitreya and was thoroughly educated by him in transcendental knowledge, he was quite competent to occupy the post of an <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya,</span> or spiritual preceptor. According to &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, anyone who is conversant in the transcendental knowledge, or the science of Godhead, be he a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> or a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra,</span> a householder or a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;,</span> is eligible to become a spiritual master. Even in the ordinary moral codes (maintained by C&#257;&#7751;akya Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita, the great politician and moralist) there is no harm in taking lessons from a person who may be by birth less than a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra.</span> This is one part of the answer. The other is that Vidura was not actually a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra.</span> He was to play the part of a so-called <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> for one hundred years, being cursed by Ma&#7751;&#7693;&#363;ka Muni. He was the incarnation of Yamar&#257;ja, one of the twelve <span class="Italic">mah&#257;janas,</span> on the level with such exalted personalities as Brahm&#257;, N&#257;rada, &#346;iva, Kapila, Bh&#299;&#7779;ma, Prahl&#257;da, etc. Being a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;jana,</span> it is the duty of Yamar&#257;ja to preach the cult of devotion to the people of the world, as N&#257;rada, Brahm&#257;, and other <span class="Italic">mah&#257;janas</span> do. But Yamar&#257;ja is always busy in his plutonic kingdom punishing the doers of sinful acts. Yamar&#257;ja is deputed by the Lord to a particular planet, some hundreds of thousands of miles away from the planet of earth, to take away the corrupt souls after death and convict them in accordance with their respective sinful activities. Thus Yamar&#257;ja has very little time to take leave from his responsible office of punishing the wrongdoers. There are more wrongdoers than righteous men. Therefore Yamar&#257;ja has to do more work than other demigods who are also authorized agents of the Supreme Lord. But he wanted to preach the glories of the Lord, and therefore by the will of the Lord he was cursed by Ma&#7751;&#7693;&#363;ka Muni to come into the world in the incarnation of Vidura and work very hard as a great devotee. Such a devotee is neither a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> nor a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> He is transcendental to such divisions of mundane society, just as the Personality of Godhead assumes His incarnation as a hog, but He is neither a hog nor a Brahm&#257;. He is above all mundane creatures. The Lord and His different authorized devotees sometimes have to play the role of many lower creatures to claim the conditioned souls, but both the Lord and His pure devotees are always in the transcendental position. When Yamar&#257;ja thus incarnated himself as Vidura, his post was officiated by Aryam&#257;, one of the many sons of Ka&#347;yapa and Aditi. The &#256;dityas are sons of Aditi, and there are twelve &#256;dityas. Aryam&#257; is one of the twelve &#256;dityas, and therefore it was quite possible for him to take charge of the office of Yamar&#257;ja during his one hundred years' absence in the form of Vidura. The conclusion is that Vidura was never a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra,</span> but was greater than the purest type of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span></div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Both Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira and Arjuna were unhappy from the beginning of the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra, but even though they were unwilling to kill their own men in the fight, it had to be done as a matter of duty, for it was planned by the supreme will of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. After the battle, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira was unhappy over such mass killings. Practically there was none to continue the Kuru dynasty after them, the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas. The only remaining hope was the child in the womb of his daughter-in-law, Uttar&#257;, and he was also attacked by A&#347;vatth&#257;m&#257;, but by the grace of the Lord the child was saved. So after the settlement of all disturbing conditions and reestablishment of the peaceful order of the state, and after seeing the surviving child, Par&#299;k&#7779;it, well satisfied, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira felt some relief as a human being, although he had very little attraction for material happiness, which is always illusory and temporary.</div>

<div class="Translation">Insurmountable, eternal time imperceptibly overcomes those who are too much attached to family affairs and are always engrossed in their thought.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">"I am now happy; I have everything in order; my bank balance is quite enough; I can now give my children enough estate; I am now successful; the poor beggar <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s</span> depend on God, but they come to beg from me; therefore I am more than the Supreme God." These are some of the thoughts which engross the insanely attached householder who is blind to the passing of eternal time. Our duration of life is measured, and no one is able to enhance it even by a second against the scheduled time ordained by the supreme will. Such valuable time, especially for the human being, should be cautiously spent because even a second passed away imperceptibly cannot be replaced, even in exchange for thousands of golden coins amassed by hard labor. Every second of human life is meant for making an ultimate solution to the problems of life, i.e. repetition of birth and death and revolving in the cycle of 8,400,000 different species of life. The material body, which is subject to birth and death, diseases and old age, is the cause of all sufferings of the living being, otherwise the living being is eternal; he is never born, nor does he ever die. Foolish persons forget this problem. They do not know at all how to solve the problems of life, but become engrossed in temporary family affairs not knowing that eternal time is passing away imperceptibly and that their measured duration of life is diminishing every second, without any solution to the big problem, namely repetition of birth and death, disease and old age. This is called illusion.</div>
<div class="Purport">But such illusion cannot work on one who is awake in the devotional service of the Lord. Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and his brothers the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas were all engaged in the service of the Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and they had very little attraction for the illusory happiness of this material world. As we have discussed previously, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira was fixed in the service of the Lord Mukunda (the Lord, who can award salvation), and therefore he had no attraction even for such comforts of life as are available in the kingdom of heaven, because even the happiness obtained on the planet Brahmaloka is also temporary and illusory. Because the living being is eternal, he can be happy only in the eternal abode of the kingdom of God (<span class="Italic">paravyoma</span>), from which no one returns to this region of repeated birth and death, disease and old age. Therefore, any comfort of life or any material happiness which does not warrant an eternal life is but illusion for the eternal living being. One who understands this factually is learned, and such a learned person can sacrifice any amount of material happiness to achieve the desired goal known as <span class="Italic">brahma-sukham,</span> or absolute happiness. Real transcendentalists are hungry for this happiness, and as a hungry man cannot be made happy by all comforts of life minus foodstuff, so the man hungry for eternal absolute happiness cannot be satisfied by any amount of material happiness. Therefore, the instruction described in this verse cannot be applied to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira or his brothers and mother. It was meant for persons like Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra, for whom Vidura came especially to impart lessons.</div>

<div class="First">Cruel death cares for no one, be he Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra or even Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira; therefore spiritual instruction, as was given to old Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra, was equally applicable to younger Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira. As a matter of fact, everyone in the royal palace, including the King and his brothers and mother, was raptly attending the lectures. But it was known to Vidura that his instructions were especially meant for Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra, who was too materialistic. The word <span class="Italic">r&#257;jan</span> is especially addressed to Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra significantly. Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra was the eldest son of his father, and therefore according to law he was to be installed on the throne of Hastin&#257;pura. But because he was blind from birth, he was disqualified from his rightful claim. But he could not forget the bereavement, and his disappointment was somewhat compensated after the death of P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u, his younger brother. His younger brother left behind him some minor children, and Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra became the natural guardian of them, but at heart he wanted to become the factual king and hand the kingdom over to his own sons, headed by Duryodhana. With all these imperial ambitions, Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra wanted to become a king, and he contrived all sorts of intrigues in consultation with his brother-in-law &#346;akuni. But everything failed by the will of the Lord, and at the last stage, even after losing everything, men and money, he wanted to remain as King, being the eldest uncle of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, as a matter of duty, maintained Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra in royal honor, and Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra was happily passing away his numbered days in the illusion of being a king or the royal uncle of King Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira. Vidura, as a saint and as the duty-bound affectionate youngest brother of Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra, wanted to awaken Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra from his slumber of disease and old age. Vidura therefore sarcastically addressed Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra as the "King," which he was actually not. Everyone is the servant of eternal time, and therefore no one can be king in this material world. King means the person who can order. The celebrated English king wanted to order time and tide, but the time and tide refused to obey his order. Therefore one is a false king in the material world, and Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra was particularly reminded of this false position and of the factual fearful happenings which had already approached him at that time. Vidura asked him to get out immediately, if he wanted to be saved from the fearful situation which was approaching him fast. He did not ask Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira in that way because he knew that a king like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira is aware of all the fearful situations of this flimsy world and would take care of himself, in due course, even though Vidura might not be present at that time.</div>

<div class="First">There is no superior power which can check the cruel hands of death. No one wants to die, however acute the source of bodily sufferings may be. Even in the days of so-called scientific advancement of knowledge, there is no remedial measure either for old age or for death. Old age is the notice of the arrival of death served by cruel time, and no one can refuse to accept either summon calls or the supreme judgment of eternal time. This is explained before Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra because he might ask Vidura to find out some remedial measure for the imminent fearful situation, as he had ordered many times before. Before ordering, however, Vidura informed Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra that there was no remedial measure by anyone or from any source in this material world. And because there is no such thing in the material world, death is identical with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as it is said by the Lord Himself in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexfe91.html?g=3591">10.34</a>).</div>

Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu asked Brahm&#257; to award him the blessings of immortality, but Brahm&#257; said that he himself was subject to death, even in the topmost planet, so how could he award him the benediction of immortality? So there is death even in the topmost planet of this universe, and what to speak of other planets, which are far, far inferior in quality to Brahmaloka, the residing planet of Brahm&#257;. Wherever there is the influence of eternal time, there is this set of tribulations, namely birth, disease, old age and death, and all of them are invincible.</div>

<div class="First">A great Indian scientist, busy in the planmaking business, was suddenly called by invincible eternal time while going to attend a very important meeting of the planning commission, and he had to surrender his life, wife, children, house, land, wealth, etc. During the political upsurge in India and its division into Pakistan and Hindustan, so many rich and influential Indians had to surrender life, property and honor due to the influence of time, and there are hundreds and thousands of examples like that all over the world, all over the universe, which are all effects of the influence of time. Therefore, the conclusion is that there is no powerful living being within the universe who can overcome the influence of time. Many poets have written verses lamenting the influence of time. Many devastations have taken place over the universes due to the influence of time, and no one could check them by any means. Even in our daily life, so many things come and go in which we have no hand, but we have to suffer or tolerate them without remedial measure. That is the result of time.</div>

<div class="First">The King is reminded of his precarious condition, influenced by cruel time, and by his past experience he should have been more intelligent to see what was going to happen to his own life. His father, Vicitrav&#299;rya, died long ago, when he and his younger brothers were all little children, and it was due to the care and kindness of Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva that they were properly brought up. Then again his brother P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u died also. Then in the Battlefield of Kuruk&#7779;etra his one hundred sons and his grandsons all died, along with all other well-wishers like Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva, Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya, Kar&#7751;a and many other kings and friends. So he had lost all men and money, and now he was living at the mercy of his nephew, whom he had put into troubles of various types. And despite all these reverses, he thought that he would prolong his life more and more. Vidura wanted to point out to Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra that everyone has to protect himself by his action and the grace of the Lord. One has to execute his duty faithfully, depending for the result on the supreme authority. No friend, no children, no father, no brother, no state and no one else can protect a person who is not protected by the Supreme Lord. One should, therefore, seek the protection of the Supreme Lord, for the human form of life is meant for seeking that protection. He was warned of his precarious conditions more and more by the following words.</div>

The signs pointed out by Vidura in the body of Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra were signs of <span class="Italic">apak&#7779;aya,</span> or dwindling of the material body before the last stroke of death. The body is born, it develops, stays, creates other bodies, dwindles and then vanishes. But foolish men want to make a permanent settlement of the perishable body and think that their estate, children, society, country, etc., will give them protection. With such foolish ideas, they become overtaken by such temporary engagements and forget altogether that they must give up this temporary body and take a new one, again to arrange for another term of society, friendship and love, again to perish ultimately. They forget their permanent identity and become foolishly active for impermanent occupations, forgetting altogether their prime duty. Saints and sages like Vidura approach such foolish men to awaken them to the real situation, but they take such <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhus</span> and saints as parasites of society, and almost all of them refuse to hear the words of such <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhus</span> and saints, although they welcome show-bottle <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhus</span> and so-called saints who can satisfy their senses.

<div class="Translation">Alas, how powerful are the hopes of a living being to continue his life. Verily, you are living just like a household dog and are eating remnants of food given by Bh&#299;ma.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">A <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhu</span> should never flatter kings or rich men to live comfortably at their cost. A <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhu</span> is to speak to the householders about the naked truth of life so that they may come to their senses about the precarious life in material existence. Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra is a typical example of an attached old man in household life. He had become a pauper in the true sense, yet he wanted to live comfortably in the house of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, of whom Bh&#299;ma especially is mentioned because personally he killed two prominent sons of Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra, namely Duryodhana and Du&#7717;&#347;&#257;sana. These two sons were very much dear to him for their notorious and nefarious activities, and Bh&#299;ma is particularly pointed out because he killed these two pet sons. Why was Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra living there at the house of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas? Because he wanted to continue his life comfortably, even at the risk of all humiliation. Vidura, therefore, was astonished how powerful is the urge to continue life. This sense of continuing one's life indicates that a living being is eternally a living entity and does not want to change his bodily habitation. The foolish man does not know that a particular term of bodily existence is awarded to him to undergo a term of imprisonment, and the human body is awarded, after many, many births and deaths, as a chance for self-realization to go back home, back to Godhead. But persons like Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra try to make plans to live there in a comfortable position with profit and interest, for they do not see things as they are. Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra is blind and continues to hope to live comfortably in the midst of all kinds of reverses of life. A <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhu</span> like Vidura is meant to awaken such blind persons and thus help them go back to Godhead, where life is eternal. Once going there, no one wants to come back to this material world of miseries. We can just imagine how responsible a task is entrusted to a <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhu</span> like Mah&#257;tm&#257; Vidura.</div>

Politicians especially do not retire from political activities unless they are dragged by the cruel hand of death or killed by some opposing element.

The <span class="Italic">k&#7771;pa&#7751;a,</span> having a wrong estimation of his material body, wants to enjoy sense gratification with his utmost strength, and even in old age he wants to become a young man by medical treatment or otherwise. Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra is addressed herein as a <span class="Italic">k&#7771;pa&#7751;a</span> because without any estimation of his material body he wants to live at any cost. Vidura is trying to open his eyes to see that he cannot live more than his term and that he must prepare for death. Since death is inevitable, why should he accept such a humiliating position for living? It is better to take the right path, even at the risk of death. Human life is meant for finishing all kinds of miseries of material existence, and life should be so regulated that one can achieve the desired goal. Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra, due to his wrong conception of life, had already spoiled eighty percent of his achieved energy, so it behooved him to utilize the remaining days of his miserly life for the ultimate good. Such a life is called miserly because one cannot properly utilize the assets of the human form of life. Only by good luck does such a miserly man meet a self-realized soul like Vidura and by his instruction gets rid of the nescience of material existence.</div>

Having obtained the human body, I have neglected to worship Your Lordship, and therefore I have willingly drunk poison." In other words, the human body is especially meant for cultivating knowledge of devotional service to the Lord, without which life becomes full of anxieties and miserable conditions. Therefore, one who has spoiled his life without such cultural activities is advised to leave home without knowledge of friends and relatives and, being thus freed from all obligations of family, society, country, etc., give up the body at some unknown destination so that others may not know where and how he has met his death. <span class="Italic">Dh&#299;ra</span> means one who is not disturbed, even when there is sufficient provocation. One cannot give up a comfortable family life due to his affectionate relation with wife and children. Self-realization is obstructed by such undue affection for family, and if anyone is at all able to forget such a relation, he is called undisturbed, or <span class="Italic">dh&#299;ra.</span> This is, however, the path of renunciation based on a frustrated life, but stabilization of such renunciation is possible only by association with bona fide saints and self-realized souls by which one can be engaged in the loving devotional service of the Lord. Sincere surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord is possible by awakening the transcendental sense of service. This is made possible by association with pure devotees of the Lord.

The idea is that the renounced order of life, after a frustrated life of sentiment in the material world, may be the stepping stone on the path of self-realization, <span class="Italic">but real perfection of the path of liberation is attained when one is practiced to depend fully on the Supreme Personality of Godhead,</span> who lives in everyone's heart as Param&#257;tm&#257;. One may live in the darkest jungle alone out of home, but a steadfast devotee knows very well that he is not alone. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is with him, and He can protect His sincere devotee in any awkward circumstance. One should therefore practice devotional service at home, hearing and chanting the holy name, quality, form, pastimes, entourage, etc., in association with pure devotees, and this practice will help one awaken God consciousness in proportion to one's sincerity of purpose. One who desires material benefit by such devotional activities can never depend on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although He sits in everyone's heart. Nor does the Lord give any direction to persons who worship Him for material gain. Such materialistic devotees may be blessed by the Lord with material benefits, but they cannot reach the stage of the first-class human being, as above mentioned. There are many examples of such sincere devotees in the history of the world, especially in India, and they are our guides on the path of self-realization. Mah&#257;tm&#257; Vidura is one such great devotee of the Lord, and we should all try to follow in his lotus footsteps for self-realization.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">One can compensate for a life of frustration by becoming a <span class="Italic">dh&#299;ra,</span> or leaving home for good without communicating with relatives, and Vidura advised his eldest brother to adopt this way without delay because very quickly the age of Kali was approaching. A conditioned soul is already degraded by the material association, and still in the Kali-yuga the good qualities of a man will deteriorate to the lowest standard. He was advised to leave home before Kali-yuga approached because the atmosphere which was created by Vidura, his valuable instructions on the facts of life, would fade away due to the influence of the age which was fast approaching. To become <span class="Italic">narottama,</span> or a first-class human being depending completely on the Supreme Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, is not possible for any ordinary man. It is stated in <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index49d1.html?g=2712">7.28</a>) that a person who is completely relieved of all taints of sinful acts can alone depend on the Supreme Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Personality of Godhead. Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra was advised by Vidura at least to become a <span class="Italic">dh&#299;ra</span> in the beginning if it were impossible for him to become a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> or a <span class="Italic">narottama.</span> Persistently endeavoring on the line of self-realization helps a person to rise to the conditions of a <span class="Italic">narottama</span> from the stage of a <span class="Italic">dh&#299;ra.</span> The <span class="Italic">dh&#299;ra</span> stage is attained after prolonged practice of the <span class="Italic">yoga</span> system, but by the grace of Vidura one can attain the stage immediately simply by willing to adopt the means of the <span class="Italic">dh&#299;ra</span> stage, which is the preparatory stage for <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa.</span> The <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> stage is the preparatory stage of <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa,</span> or the first-grade devotee of the Lord.</div>

Thus he immediately left home to set out on the path of liberation, as directed by his younger brother Vidura.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, the great preacher of the principles of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> has stressed the importance of association with <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhus,</span> pure devotees of the Lord. He said that even by a moments association with a pure devotee, one can achieve all perfection. We are not ashamed to admit that this fact was experienced in our practical life. Were we not favored by His Divine Grace &#346;r&#299;mad Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; Gosv&#257;m&#299; Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, by our first meeting for a few minutes only, it would have been impossible for us to accept this mighty task of describing <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> in English. Without seeing him at that opportune moment, we could have become a very great business magnate, but never would we have been able to walk the path of liberation and be engaged in the factual service of the Lord under instructions of His Divine Grace. And here is another practical example by the action of Vidura's association with Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra was tightly bound in a network of material affinities related to politics, economy and family attachment, and he did everything in his power to achieve so-called success in his planned projects, but he was frustrated from the beginning to the end so far as his material activities were concerned. And yet, despite his life of failure, he achieved the greatest of all success in self-realization by the forceful instructions of a pure devotee of the Lord, who is the typical emblem of a <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhu.</span> The scriptures enjoin, therefore, that one should associate with <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhus</span> only, rejecting all other kinds of association, and by doing so one will have ample opportunity to hear the <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhus,</span> who can cut to pieces the bonds of illusory affection in the material world. It is a fact that the material world is a great illusion because everything appears to be a tangible reality but at the next moment evaporates like the dashing foam of the sea or a cloud in the sky. A cloud in the sky undoubtedly appears to be a reality because it rains, and due to rains so many temporary green things appear, but in the ultimate issue, everything disappears, namely the cloud, rain and green vegetation, all in due course. But the sky remains, and the varieties of sky or luminaries also remain forever. Similarly, the Absolute Truth, which is compared to the sky, remains eternally, and the temporary cloudlike illusion comes and goes away. Foolish living beings are attracted by the temporary cloud, but intelligent men are more concerned with the eternal sky with all its variegatedness.</div>

The Vedic civilization especially prepares chaste and devoted wives, of whom G&#257;ndh&#257;r&#299; is one amongst many mentioned in history. Lak&#7779;m&#299;j&#299; S&#299;t&#257;dev&#299; was also a daughter of a great king, but she followed her husband, Lord R&#257;macandra, into the forest. Similarly, as a woman G&#257;ndh&#257;r&#299; could have remained at home or at her father's house, but as a chaste and gentle lady she followed her husband without consideration. Instructions for the renounced order of life were imparted to Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra by Vidura, and G&#257;ndh&#257;r&#299; was by the side of her husband. But he did not ask her to follow him because he was at that time fully determined, like a great warrior who faces all kinds of dangers in the battlefield. He was no longer attracted to so-called wife or relatives, and he decided to start alone, but as a chaste lady G&#257;ndh&#257;r&#299; decided to follow her husband till the last moment. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra accepted the order of <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha,</span> and at this stage the wife is allowed to remain as a voluntary servitor, but in the <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> stage no wife can stay with her former husband. A <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> is considered to be a dead man civilly, and therefore the wife becomes a civil widow without connection with her former husband. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra did not deny his faithful wife, and she followed her husband at her own risk.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Every living being, either in this material world or in the spiritual world, is under the control of the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead. Beginning from Brahm&#257;j&#299;, the leader of this universe, down to the insignificant ant, all are abiding by the order of the Supreme Lord. Thus the constitutional position of the living being is subordination under the control of the Lord. The foolish living being, especially man, artificially rebels against the law of the Supreme and thus becomes chastised as an <span class="Italic">asura,</span> or lawbreaker. A living being is placed in a particular position by the order of the Supreme Lord, and he is again shifted from that place by the order of the Supreme Lord or His authorized agents. Brahm&#257;, &#346;iva, Indra, Candra, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira or, in modern history, Napoleon, Akbar, Alexander, Gandhi, Shubhash and Nehru all are servants of the Lord, and they are placed in and removed from their respective positions by the supreme will of the Lord. None of them is independent. Even though such men or leaders rebel so as not to recognize the supremacy of the Lord, they are put under still more rigorous laws of the material world by different miseries. Only the foolish man, therefore, says that there is no God. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira was being convinced of this naked truth because he was greatly overwhelmed by the sudden departure of his old uncles and aunt. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra was placed in that position according to his past deeds; he had already suffered or enjoyed the benefits accrued to him in the past, but due to his good luck, somehow or other he had a good younger brother, Vidura, and by his instruction he left to achieve salvation by closing all accounts in the material world.</div>
<div class="Purport">Ordinarily one cannot change the course of one's due happiness and distress by plan. Everyone has to accept them as they come under the subtle arrangement of <span class="Italic">k&#257;la,</span> or invincible time. There is no use trying to counteract them. The best thing is, therefore, that one should endeavor to achieve salvation, and this prerogative is given only to man because of his developed condition of mental activities and intelligence. Only for man are there different Vedic instructions for attainment of salvation during the human form of existence. One who misuses this opportunity of advanced intelligence is verily condemned and put into different types of miseries, either in this present life or in the future. That is the way the Supreme controls everyone.</div>

<div class="Translation">As a cow, bound through the nose by a long rope, is conditioned, so also human beings are bound by different Vedic injunctions and are conditioned to obey the orders of the Supreme.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Every living being, whether a man or an animal or a bird, thinks that he is free by himself, but actually no one is free from the severe laws of the Lord. The laws of the Lord are severe because they cannot be disobeyed in any circumstance. The manmade laws may be evaded by cunning outlaws, but in the codes of the supreme lawmaker there is not the slightest possibility of neglecting the laws. A slight change in the course of God-made law can bring about a massive danger to be faced by the lawbreaker. Such laws of the Supreme are generally known as the codes of religion, under different conditions, but the principle of religion everywhere is one and the same, namely, obey the orders of the Supreme God, the codes of religion. That is the condition of material existence. All living beings in the material world have taken up the risk of conditioned life by their own selection and are thus entrapped by the laws of material nature. The only way to get out of the entanglement is to agree to obey the Supreme. But instead of becoming free from the clutches of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> or illusion, foolish human beings become bound up by different nomenclatures, being designated as <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as, k&#7779;atriyas, vai&#347;yas, &#347;&#363;dras,</span> Hindus, Mohammedans, Indians, Europeans, Americans, Chinese, and many others, and thus they carry out the orders of the Supreme Lord under the influence of respective scriptural or legislative injunctions. The statutory laws of the state are imperfect imitation replicas of religious codes. The secular state, or the godless state, allows the citizens to break the laws of God, but restricts them from disobeying the laws of the state; the result is that the people in general suffer more by breaking the laws of God than by obeying the imperfect laws made by man. Every man is imperfect by constitution under conditions of material existence, and there is not the least possibility that even the most materially advanced man can enact perfect legislation. On the other hand, there is no such imperfection in the laws of God. If leaders are educated in the laws of God, there is no necessity of a makeshift legislative council of aimless men. There is necessity of change in the makeshift laws of man, but there is no change in the God-made laws because they are made perfect by the all-perfect Personality of Godhead. The codes of religion, scriptural injunctions, are made by liberated representatives of God in consideration of different conditions of living, and by carrying out the orders of the Lord, the conditioned living beings gradually become free from the clutches of material existence. The factual position of the living being is, however, that he is the eternal servitor of the Supreme Lord. In his liberated state he renders service to the Lord in transcendental love and thus enjoys a life of full freedom, even sometimes on an equal level with the Lord or sometimes more than the Lord. But in the conditioned material world, every living being wants to be the Lord of other living beings, and thus by the illusion of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> this mentality of lording it over becomes a cause of further extension of conditional life. So in the material world the living being is still more conditioned, until he surrenders unto the Lord by reviving his original state of eternal servitorship. That is the last instruction of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and all other recognized scriptures of the world.</div>

<div class="Translation">As a player sets up and disperses his playthings according to his own sweet will, so the supreme will of the Lord brings men together and separates them.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">We must know for certain that the particular position in which we are now set up is an arrangement of the supreme will in terms of our own acts in the past. The Supreme Lord is present as the localized Param&#257;tm&#257; in the heart of every living being, as it is said in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexaafe.html?g=4486">13.23</a>), and therefore he knows everything of our activities in every stage of our lives. He rewards the reactions of our actions by placing us in some particular place. A rich man gets his son born with a silver spoon in his mouth, but the child who came as the rich man's son deserved such a place, and therefore he is placed there by the will of the Lord. And at a particular moment when the child has to be removed from that place, he is also carried by the will of the Supreme, even if the child or the father does not wish to be separated from the happy relation. The same thing happens in the case of a poor man also. Neither rich man nor poor man has any control over such meetings or separations of living beings. The example of a player and his playthings should not be misunderstood. One may argue that since the Lord is bound to award the reactionary results of our own actions, the example of a player cannot be applied. But it is not so. We must always remember that the Lord is the supreme will, and He is not bound by any law. Generally the law of <span class="Italic">karma</span> is that one is awarded the result of one's own actions, but in special cases, by the will of the Lord, such resultant actions are changed also. But this change can be affected by the will of the Lord only, and no other. Therefore, the example of the player cited in this verse is quite appropriate, for the Supreme Will is absolutely free to do whatever He likes, and because He is all-perfect, there is no mistake in any of His actions or reactions. These changes of resultant actions are especially rendered by the Lord when a pure devotee is involved. It is assured in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexedd3.html?g=3255">9.30</a>-31) that the Lord saves a pure devotee who has surrendered unto Him without reservation from all sorts of reactions of sins, and there is no doubt about this. There are hundreds of examples of reactions changed by the Lord in the history of the world. If the Lord is able to change the reactions of one's past deeds, then certainly He is not Himself bound by any action or reaction of His own deeds. He is perfect and transcendental to all laws.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The actual fact is that every living being is an individual part and parcel of the Supreme Being, and his constitutional position is subordinate cooperative service. Either in his conditional material existence or in his liberated position of full knowledge and eternity, the living entity is eternally under the control of the Supreme Lord. But those who are not conversant with factual knowledge put forward many speculative propositions about the real position of the living entity. It is admitted, however, by all schools of philosophy, that the living being is eternal and that the covering body of the five material elements is perishable and temporary. The eternal living entity transmigrates from one material body to another by the law of <span class="Italic">karma,</span> and material bodies are perishable by their fundamental structures. Therefore there is nothing to be lamented in the case of the soul's being transferred into another body, or the material body's perishing at a certain stage. There are others also who believe in the merging of the spirit soul in the Supreme Spirit when it is uncovered by the material encagement, and there are others also who do not believe in the existence of spirit or soul, but believe in tangible matter. In our daily experience we find so many transformations of matter from one form to another, but we do not lament such changing features. In either of the above cases, the force of divine energy is uncheckable; no one has any hand in it, and thus there is no cause of grief.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The world's movements for freedom through political, economic, social, and cultural propaganda can do no benefit to anyone, for they are controlled by superior power. A conditioned living being is under the full control of material nature, represented by eternal time and activities under the dictation of different modes of nature. There are three material modes of nature, namely goodness, passion and ignorance. Unless one is situated in the mode of goodness, one cannot see things as they are. The passionate and the ignorant cannot even see things as they are. Therefore a person who is passionate and ignorant cannot direct his activities on the right path. Only the man in the quality of goodness can help to a certain extent. Most persons are passionate and ignorant, and therefore their plans and projects can hardly do any good to others. Above the modes of nature is eternal time, which is called <span class="Italic">k&#257;la</span> because it changes the shape of everything in the material world. Even if we are able to do something temporarily beneficial, time will see that the good project is frustrated in course of time. The only thing possible to be done is to get rid of eternal time, <span class="Italic">k&#257;la,</span> which is compared to <span class="Italic">k&#257;la-sarpa,</span> or the cobra snake, whose bite is always lethal.

<div class="Translation">Those who are devoid of hands are prey for those who have hands; those devoid of legs are prey for the four-legged. The weak are the subsistence of the strong, and the general rule holds that one living being is food for another.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">A systematic law of subsistence in the struggle for existence is there by the supreme will, and there is no escape for anyone by any amount of planning. The living beings who have come to the material world against the will of the Supreme Being are under the control of a supreme power called <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;-&#347;akti,</span> the deputed agent of the Lord, and this <span class="Italic">daiv&#299; m&#257;y&#257;</span> is meant to pinch the conditioned souls by threefold miseries, one of which is explained here in this verse: <span class="Italic">the weak are the subsistence of the strong.</span> No one is strong enough to protect himself from the onslaught of a stronger, and by the will of the Lord there are systematic categories of the weak, the stronger and the strongest. There is nothing to be lamented if a tiger eats a weaker animal, including a man, because that is the law of the Supreme Lord. But although the law states that a human being must subsist on another living being, there is the law of good sense also, for the human being is meant to obey the laws of the scriptures. This is impossible for other animals. The human being is meant for self-realization, and for that purpose he is not to eat anything which is not first offered to the Lord. The Lord accepts from His devotee all kinds of food preparations made of vegetables, fruits, leaves and grains. Fruits, leaves and milk in different varieties can be offered to the Lord, and after the Lord accepts the foodstuff, the devotee can partake of the <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da,</span> by which all suffering in the struggle for existence will be gradually mitigated. This is confirmed in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index8855.html?g=3219">9.26</a>). Even those who are accustomed to eat animals can offer foodstuff, not to the Lord directly, but to an agent of the Lord, under certain conditions of religious rites. Injunctions of the scriptures are meant not to encourage the eaters of animals, but to restrict them by regulated principles.</div>
<div class="Purport">The living being is the source of subsistence for other, stronger living beings. No one should be very anxious for his subsistence in any circumstances because there are living beings everywhere, and no living being starves for want of food at any place. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira is advised by N&#257;rada not to worry about his uncles' suffering for want of food, for they could live on vegetables available in the jungles as <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da</span> of the Supreme Lord and thus realize the path of salvation.</div>
<div class="Purport">Exploitation of the weaker living being by the stronger is the natural law of existence; there is always an attempt to devour the weak in different kingdoms of living beings. There is no possibility of checking this tendency by any artificial means under material conditions; it can be checked only by awakening the spiritual sense of the human being by practice of spiritual regulations. The spiritual regulative principles, however, do not allow a man to slaughter weaker animals on one side and teach others peaceful coexistence. If man does not allow the animals peaceful coexistence, how can he expect peaceful existence in human society? The blind leaders must therefore understand the Supreme Being and then try to implement the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God, or R&#257;ma-r&#257;jya, is impossible without the awakening of God consciousness in the mass mind of the people of the world.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Supreme Lord Personality of Godhead is one without a second, but He manifests Himself by different energies because He is by nature blissful. The living beings are also manifestations of His marginal energy, qualitatively one with the Lord, and there are innumerable living beings both within and without the external and internal energies of the Lord. Since the spiritual world is a manifestation of the Lord's internal energy, the living beings within that internal potency are qualitatively one with the Lord without contamination from the external potency. Although qualitatively one with the Lord, the living being, due to contamination of the material world, is pervertedly manifested, and therefore he experiences so-called happiness and distress in the material world. Such experiences are all ephemeral and do not affect the spirit soul. The perception of such ephemeral happiness and distress is due only to the forgetfulness of his qualities, which are equal to the Lord's. There is, however, a regular current from the Lord Himself, from within and without, by which to rectify the fallen condition of the living being. From within He corrects the desiring living beings as localized Param&#257;tm&#257;, and from without He corrects by His manifestations, the spiritual master and the revealed scriptures. One should look unto the Lord; one should not be disturbed by the so-called manifestations of happiness or distress, but he should try to cooperate with the Lord in His outward activities for correcting the fallen souls. By His order only, one should become a spiritual master and cooperate with the Lord. One should not become a spiritual master for one's personal benefit, for some material gain or as an avenue of business or occupation for earning livelihood. Bona fide spiritual masters who look unto the Supreme Lord to cooperate with Him are actually qualitatively one with the Lord, and the forgetful ones are perverted reflections only. Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira Mah&#257;r&#257;ja is advised by N&#257;rada, therefore, not to be disturbed by the affairs of so-called happiness and distress, but to look only unto the Lord to execute the mission for which the Lord has descended. That was his prime duty.</div>

<div class="First">There are two classes of human beings, namely the envious and the obedient.

Not only are the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> envious of the Lord in even denying the existence of the Lord, but they are also envious of all other living beings. The predominance of <span class="Italic">asuras</span> in the world is occasionally rectified by the Lord when He eliminates them from the world and establishes a rule of <span class="Italic">devat&#257;s</span> like the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas. His designation as <span class="Italic">k&#257;la</span> in disguise is significant. He is not at all dangerous, but He is the transcendental form of eternity, knowledge and bliss. For the devotees His factual form is disclosed, and for the nondevotees He appears like <span class="Italic">k&#257;la-r&#363;pa,</span> which is causal form. This causal form of the Lord is not at all pleasing to the <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> and therefore they think of the Lord as formless in order to feel secure that they will not be vanquished by the Lord.</div>

Such disruptions take place not only in human society but also among animals, birds or other living beings, including the demigods in the higher planets.

<div class="Translation">On the banks at Saptasrota, Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra is now engaged in beginning a&#7779;&#7789;&#257;&#7749;ga-yoga by bathing three times daily, in the morning, noon and evening, by performing the Agni-hotra sacrifice with fire and by drinking only water. This helps one control the mind and the senses and frees one completely from thoughts of familial affection.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The <span class="Italic">yoga</span> system is a mechanical way to control the senses and the mind and divert them from matter to spirit. The preliminary processes are the sitting posture, meditation, spiritual thoughts, manipulation of air passing within the body, and gradual situation in trance, facing the Absolute Person, Param&#257;tm&#257;. Such mechanical ways of rising to the spiritual platform prescribe some regulative principles of taking bath daily three times, fasting as far as possible, sitting and concentrating the mind on spiritual matters and thus gradually becoming free from <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;aya,</span> or material objectives. Material existence means to be absorbed in the material objective, which is simply illusory. House, country, family, society, children, property, and business are some of the material coverings of the spirit, <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;,</span> and the <span class="Italic">yoga</span> system helps one to become free from all these illusory thoughts and gradually turn towards the Absolute Person, Param&#257;tm&#257;. By material association and education, we learn simply to concentrate on flimsy things, but <span class="Italic">yoga</span> is the process of forgetting them altogether. Modern so-called <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">yoga</span> systems manifest some magical feats, and ignorant persons are attracted by such false things, or they accept the <span class="Italic">yoga</span> system as a cheap healing process for diseases of the gross body. But factually the <span class="Italic">yoga</span> system is the process of learning to forget what we have acquired throughout the struggle for existence. Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra was all along engaged in improving family affairs by raising the standard of living of his sons or by usurping the property of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas for the sake of his own sons. These are common affairs for a man grossly materialistic and without knowledge of the spiritual force. He does not see how this can drag one from heaven to hell. By the grace of his younger brother Vidura, Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra was enlightened and could see his grossly illusory engagements, and by such enlightenment he was able to leave home for spiritual realization. &#346;r&#299; N&#257;radadeva was just foretelling the way of his spiritual progress in a place which was sanctified by the flow of the celestial Ganges. Drinking water only, without solid food, is also considered fasting. This is necessary for advancement of spiritual knowledge. A foolish man wants to be a cheap <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> without observing the regulative principles. A man who has no control over the tongue at first can hardly become a <span class="Italic">yog&#299;.</span> <span class="Italic">Yog&#299;</span> and <span class="Italic">bhog&#299;</span> are two opposite terms. The <span class="Italic">bhog&#299;,</span> or the merry man who eats and drinks, cannot be a <span class="Italic">yog&#299;,</span> for a <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> is never allowed to eat and drink unrestrictedly. We may note with profit how Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra began his <span class="Italic">yoga</span> system by drinking water only and sitting calmly in a place with a spiritual atmosphere, deeply absorbed in the thoughts of the Lord Hari, the Personality of Godhead.</div>

Thus all his senses were being engaged in the service of the Lord. This process directly helps the devotee to get freedom from the contaminations of the three material modes of nature. Even the highest mode, the material mode of goodness, is also a cause of material bondage, and what to speak of the other qualities, namely passion and ignorance. Passion and ignorance increase the material propensities of hankering for material enjoyment, and a strong sense of lust provokes the accumulation of wealth and power. One who has conquered these two base mentalities and has raised himself to the platform of goodness, which is full of knowledge and morality, cannot also control the senses, namely the eyes, the tongue, the nose, the ear and touch. But one who has surrendered himself unto the lotus feet of Lord Hari, as above mentioned, can transcend all influences of the modes of material nature and be fixed in the service of the Lord. The <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> process, therefore, directly applies the senses to the loving service of the Lord. This prohibits the performer from engaging in material activities. This process of turning the senses from material attachment to the loving transcendental service of the Lord is called <span class="Italic">praty&#257;h&#257;ra,</span> and the very process is called <span class="Italic">pr&#257;&#7751;&#257;y&#257;ma,</span> ultimately ending in <span class="Italic">sam&#257;dhi,</span> or absorption in pleasing the Supreme Lord Hari by all means.</div>

This is the highest perfectional development of spiritual identity, which was attained by Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra by the grace of Vidura and the Lord.

She left home after losing her one hundred sons, and in the forest she saw that her most beloved husband was also burning. Now she actually felt alone, and therefore she entered the fire of her husband and followed her husband to death. This entering of a chaste lady into the fire of her dead husband is called the <span class="Italic">sat&#299;</span> rite, and the action is considered to be most perfect for a woman. In a later age, this <span class="Italic">sat&#299;</span> rite became an obnoxious criminal affair because the ceremony was forced upon even an unwilling woman. In this fallen age it is not possible for any lady to follow the <span class="Italic">sat&#299;</span> rite as chastely as it was done by G&#257;ndh&#257;r&#299; and others in past ages. A chaste wife like G&#257;ndh&#257;r&#299; would feel the separation of her husband to be more burning than actual fire. Such a lady can observe the <span class="Italic">sat&#299;</span> rite voluntarily, and there is no criminal force by anyone. When the rite became a formality only and force was applied upon a lady to follow the principle, actually it became criminal, and therefore the ceremony was to be stopped by state law.

<div class="First">Vidura was astonished to see the marvelous departure of his brother Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra as a liberated <span class="Italic">yog&#299;,</span> for in his past life he was much attached to materialism. Of course it was only due to Vidura that his brother attained the desirable goal of life. Vidura was therefore glad to learn about it. But he was sorry that he could not make his brother turn into a pure devotee. This was not done by Vidura because of Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra's being inimical to the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, who were all devotees of the Lord. An offense at the feet of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is more dangerous than an offense at the lotus feet of the Lord. Vidura was certainly very liberal to bestow mercy upon his brother Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra, whose past life was very materialistic. But ultimately the result of such mercy certainly depended on the will of the Supreme Lord in the present life; therefore Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra attained liberation only, and after many such liberated states of life one can attain to the stage of devotional service. Vidura was certainly very mortified by the death of his brother and sister-in-law, and the only remedy to mitigate such lamentation was to go out to pilgrimage. Thus Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira had no chance to call back Vidura, his surviving uncle.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">When civilization is disconnected from the loving relation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, symptoms like changes of seasonal regulations, foul means of livelihood, greed, anger and fraudulence become rampant. The change of seasonal regulations refers to one season's atmosphere becoming manifest in another season-for example the rainy season's being transferred to autumn, or the fructification of fruits and flowers from one season in another season. A godless man is invariably greedy, angry and fraudulent. Such a man can earn his livelihood by any means, black or white. During the reign of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, all the above symptoms were conspicuous by their absence. But Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira was astonished to experience even a slight change in the godly atmosphere of his kingdom, and at once he suspected the disappearance of the Lord. Foul means of livelihood implies deviation from one's occupational duty. There are prescribed duties for everyone, such as the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a, k&#7779;atriya, vai&#347;ya</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra,</span> but anyone who deviates from his prescribed duty and declares another's duty to be his own is following a foul and improper duty. A man becomes too greedy for wealth and power when he has no higher objective in life and when he thinks that this earthly life of a few years is all in all. Ignorance is the cause for all these anomalies in human society, and to remove this ignorance, especially in this age of degradation, the powerful sun is there to distribute light in the shape of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span></div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">A conditioned living being is endowed with four principles of malpractice, namely errors, insanity, inability and cheating. These are signs of imperfection, and out of the four the propensity to cheat others is most prominent. And this cheating practice is there in the conditioned souls because the conditioned souls are primarily in the material world imbued with an unnatural desire to lord it over the material world. A living being in his pure state is not conditioned by the laws because in his pure state he is conscious that a living being is eternally subservient to the Supreme Being, and thus it is always good for him to remain subservient, instead of falsely trying to lord it over the property of the Supreme Lord. In the conditioned state the living being is not satisfied even if he actually becomes the lord of all that he surveys, which he never becomes, and therefore he becomes the victim of all kinds of cheating, even with his nearest and most intimate relations. In such an unsatisfactory state of affairs, there is no harmony, even between father and sons or between husband and wife. But all these contending difficulties can be mitigated by one process, and that is the devotional service of the Lord. The world of hypocrisy can be checked only by counteraction through devotional service to the Lord and nothing else. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, having observed the disparities, conjectured the disappearance of the Lord from the earth.</div>

<div class="Translation">Is He going to quit His earthly pastimes, as Devar&#7779;i N&#257;rada indicated? Has that time already arrived?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">As we have discussed many times, the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a has many plenary expansions, and each and every one of them, although equally powerful, executes different functions. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> there are different statements by the Lord, and each of these statements is meant for different plenary portions or portions of the plenary portions. For example, &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Lord, says in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;:</span></div>
<div class="Purport">"Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion-at that time I descend Myself." (Bg. <a href="indexd622.html?g=1487">4.7</a>)</div>
<div class="Purport">"To deliver the faithful, to annihilate the miscreants and also to reestablish the principles of occupational duty, I appear in every age." (Bg. <a href="indexb53f.html?g=1496">4.8</a>)</div>
<div class="Purport">"If I should cease to work, then all humanity would be misdirected. I would also be the cause of creating unwanted population, and I would thereby destroy the peace of all sentient beings." (Bg. <a href="indexd859.html?g=1248">3.24</a>)</div>
<div class="Purport">"Whatever action a great man performs, common men will follow. And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues." (Bg. <a href="index8f52.html?g=1221">3.21</a>)</div>
<div class="Purport">All the above statements by the Lord apply to different plenary portions of the Lord, namely His expansions such as Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a, V&#257;sudeva, Pradyumna, Aniruddha and N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. These are all He Himself in different transcendental expansions, and still the Lord as &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a functions in a different sphere of transcendental exchange with different grades of devotees. And yet Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as He is appears once every twenty-four hours of Brahm&#257;'s time (or after a lapse of 8,640,000,000 solar years) in each and every universe, and all His transcendental pastimes are displayed in each and every universe in a routine spool. But in that routine spool the functions of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Lord V&#257;sudeva, etc., are complex problems for the layman. There is no difference between the Lord's Self and the Lord's transcendental body. The expansions execute differential activities. When the Lord, however, appears in His person as Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, His other plenary portions also join in Him by His inconceivable potency called <span class="Italic">yogam&#257;y&#257;,</span> and thus the Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana is different from the Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a of Mathur&#257; or the Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a of Dv&#257;rak&#257;. The <span class="Italic">vir&#257;&#7789;-r&#363;pa</span> of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is also different from Him, by His inconceivable potency. The <span class="Italic">vir&#257;&#7789;-r&#363;pa</span> exhibited on the Battlefield of Kuruk&#7779;etra is the material conception of His form. Therefore it should be understood that when Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was apparently killed by the bow and arrow of the hunter, the Lord left His so-called material body in the material world. The Lord is <span class="Italic">kaivalya,</span> and for Him there is no difference between matter and spirit because everything is created from Him. Therefore His quitting one sort of body or accepting another body does not mean that He is like the ordinary living being. All such activities are simultaneously one and different by His inconceivable potency. When Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira was lamenting the possibility of His disappearance, it was just in pursuance of a custom of lamenting the disappearance of a great friend, but factually the Lord never quits His transcendental body, as is misconceived by less intelligent persons. Such less intelligent persons have been condemned by the Lord Himself in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> and they are known as the <span class="Italic">m&#363;&#7693;has.</span> That the Lord left His body means that He left again His plenary portions in the respective <span class="Italic">dh&#257;mas</span> (transcendental abodes), as He left His <span class="Italic">vir&#257;&#7789;-r&#363;pa</span> in the material world.</div>

<div class="Translation">From Him only, all our kingly opulence, good wives, lives, progeny, control over our subjects, victory over our enemies, and future accommodations in higher planets have become possible. All this is due to His causeless mercy upon us.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Material prosperity consists of a good wife, good home, sufficient land, good children, aristocratic family relations, victory over competitors and, by pious work, attainment of accommodations in the higher celestial planets for better facilities of material amenities. These facilities are earned not only by one's hard manual labor or by unfair means, but by the mercy of the Supreme Lord. Prosperity earned by one's personal endeavor also depends on the mercy of the Lord. Personal labor must be there in addition to the Lord's benediction, but without the Lord's benediction no one is successful simply by personal labor. The modernized man of Kali-yuga believes in personal endeavor and denies the benediction of the Supreme Lord. Even a great <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> of India delivered speeches in Chicago protesting the benedictions of the Supreme Lord. But as far as Vedic <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> are concerned, as we find in the pages of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> the ultimate sanction for all success rests in the hands of the Supreme Lord. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira admits this truth in his personal success, and it behooves one to follow in the footsteps of a great king and devotee of the Lord to make life a full success. If one could achieve success without the sanction of the Lord then no medical practitioner would fail to cure a patient. Despite the most advanced treatment of a suffering patient by the most up-to-date medical practitioner, there is death, and even in the most hopeless case, without medical treatment, a patient is cured astonishingly. Therefore the conclusion is that God's sanction is the immediate cause for all happenings, good or bad. Any successful man should feel grateful to the Lord for all he has achieved.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Material advancement of civilization means advancement of the reactions of the threefold miseries due to celestial influence, earthly reactions and bodily or mental pains. By the celestial influence of the stars there are many calamities like excessive heat, cold, rains or no rains, and the after-effects are famine, disease and epidemic. The aggregate result is agony of the body and the mind. Man-made material science cannot do anything to counteract these threefold miseries. They are all punishments from the superior energy of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> under the direction of the Supreme Lord. Therefore our constant touch with the Lord by devotional service can give us relief without our being disturbed in the discharge of our human duties. The <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> however, who do not believe in the existence of God, make their own plans to counteract all these threefold miseries, and so they meet with failures every time. The <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexd990.html?g=2586">7.14</a>) clearly states that the reaction of material energy is never to be conquered, because of the binding effects of the three modes. They can simply be overcome by one who surrenders fully in devotion under the lotus feet of the Lord.</div>

<div class="First">Material existence is full of undesirables. Things we do not want are forced upon us by some superior energy, and we do not see that these undesirables are under the grip of the three modes of material nature. When a man's eyes, arms and thighs all quiver constantly, one must know that something is going to happen which is undesirable. These undesirables are compared to fire in a forest. No one goes into the forest to set fires, but fires automatically take place in the forest, creating inconceivable calamities for the living beings of the forest. Such a fire cannot be extinguished by any human efforts. The fire can be extinguished only by the mercy of the Lord, who sends clouds to pour water on the forest. Similarly, undesirable happenings in life cannot be checked by any number of plans. Such miseries can be removed only by the mercy of the Lord, who sends His bona fide representatives to enlighten human beings and thus save them from all calamities.</div>

While returning to Delhi from Dv&#257;rak&#257;, Arjuna must have visited the city of Mathur&#257;, and therefore the inquiry about the King of Mathur&#257; is valid. Amongst various names of the relatives, the name of R&#257;ma or Balar&#257;ma, eldest brother of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, is added with the words "the Personality of Godhead" because Lord Balar&#257;ma is the immediate expansion of <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-tattva</span> as <span class="Italic">prak&#257;&#347;a-vigraha</span> of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.

But expansions of the <span class="Italic">j&#299;va-&#347;akti,</span> the category of the ordinary living beings, are not at all equal with the Lord. One who considers the <span class="Italic">j&#299;va-&#347;akti</span> and the <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-tattva</span> to be on an equal level is considered a condemned soul of the world. &#346;r&#299; R&#257;ma, or Balar&#257;ma, is the protector of the devotees of the Lord. Baladeva acts as the spiritual master of all devotees, and by His causeless mercy the fallen souls are delivered. &#346;r&#299; Baladeva appeared as &#346;r&#299; Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu during the advent of Lord Caitanya, and the great Lord Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu exhibited His causeless mercy by delivering a pair of extremely fallen souls, namely Jag&#257;i and M&#257;dh&#257;i. Therefore it is particularly mentioned herein that Balar&#257;ma is the protector of the devotees of the Lord. By His divine grace only one can approach the Supreme Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and thus &#346;r&#299; Balar&#257;ma is the mercy incarnation of the Lord, manifested as the spiritual master, the savior of the pure devotees.</div>

They all grew up, and each of them had as many sons as their father, and the whole aggregate was something near 1,610,800 family members of the Lord. The Lord is the father of all living beings, who are countless in number; therefore only a few of them are called to associate with the Lord in His transcendental pastimes as the Lord of Dv&#257;rak&#257; on this earth. It is not astonishing that the Lord maintained a visible family consisting of so many members. It is better to refrain from comparing the Lord's position to ours, and it becomes a simple truth as soon as we understand at least a partial calculation of the Lord's transcendental position. King Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, while inquiring about the Lord's sons and grandsons at Dv&#257;rak&#257;, mentioned only the chieftains amongst them, for it was impossible for him to remember all the names of the Lord's family members.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The constant companions of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, such as Uddhava, are all liberated souls, and they descended along with Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a to this material world to fulfill the mission of the Lord. The P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas are also liberated souls who descended along with Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a to serve Him in His transcendental pastimes on this earth. As stated in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexb53f.html?g=1496">4.8</a>), the Lord and His eternal associates, who are also liberated souls like the Lord, come down on this earth at certain intervals. The Lord remembers them all, but His associates, although liberated souls, forget due to their being <span class="Italic">ta&#7789;asth&#257; &#347;akti,</span> or marginal potency of the Lord. That is the difference between the <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-tattva</span> and <span class="Italic">j&#299;va-tattva.</span> The <span class="Italic">j&#299;va-tattvas</span> are infinitesimal potential particles of the Lord, and therefore they require the protection of the Lord at all times. And to the eternal servitors of the Lord, the Lord is pleased to give all protection at all times. The liberated souls never, therefore, think themselves as free as the Lord or as powerful as the Lord, but they always seek the protection of the Lord in all circumstances, both in the material world and in the spiritual world. This dependence of the liberated soul is constitutional, for the liberated souls are like sparks of a fire that are able to exhibit the glow of fire along with the fire and not independently. Independently the glow of the sparks is extinguished, although the quality of fire or the glowing is there. Thus those who give up the protection of the Lord and become so-called lords themselves, out of spiritual ignorance, come back again to this material world, even after prolonged <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> of the severest type. That is the verdict of all Vedic literature.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Here in this particular verse the Lord is described as <span class="Italic">bhagav&#257;n, govinda, brahma&#7751;ya</span> and <span class="Italic">bhakta-vatsala.</span> He is <span class="Italic">bhagav&#257;n svayam,</span> or the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, full with all opulences, all power, all knowledge, all beauty, all fame and all renunciation. No one is equal to or greater than Him. He is Govinda because He is the pleasure of the cows and the senses. Those who have purified their senses by the devotional service of the Lord can render unto Him real service and thereby derive transcendental pleasure out of such purified senses. Only the impure conditioned living being cannot derive any pleasure from the senses, but being illusioned by false pleasures of the senses, he becomes servant of the senses. Therefore, we need His protection for our own interest. The Lord is the protector of cows and the brahminical culture. A society devoid of cow protection and brahminical culture is not under the direct protection of the Lord, just as the prisoners in the jails are not under the protection of the king but under the protection of a severe agent of the king. Without cow protection and cultivation of the brahminical qualities in human society, at least for a section of the members of society, no human civilization can prosper at any length. By brahminical culture, the development of the dormant qualities of goodness, namely truthfulness, equanimity, sense control, forbearance, simplicity, general knowledge, transcendental knowledge, and firm faith in the Vedic wisdom, one can become a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> and thus see the Lord as He is. And after surpassing the brahminical perfection, one has to become a devotee of the Lord so that His loving affection in the form of proprietor, master, friend, son and lover can be transcendentally achieved. The stage of a devotee, which attracts the transcendental affection of the Lord, does not develop unless one has developed the qualities of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> as above mentioned. The Lord is inclined to a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> of quality and not of false prestige. Those who are less than a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> by qualification cannot establish any relation with the Lord, just as fire cannot be kindled from the raw earth unless there is wood, although there is a relation between wood and the earth. Since the Lord is all-perfect in Himself, there could not be any question of His welfare, and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira refrained from asking this question. He simply inquired about His residential place, Dv&#257;rak&#257; Pur&#299;, where pious men assemble. The Lord stays only where pious men assemble and takes pleasure in their glorifying the Supreme Truth. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira was anxious to know about the pious men and their pious acts in the city of Dv&#257;rak&#257;.</div>

Thus Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira has compared the Yadu dynasty to the ocean of milk and &#346;r&#299; Balar&#257;ma to the Ananta where Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a resides.

Beyond the material sky, further than we can see with our eyes and beyond the sevenfold coverings of the universe, there is the Causal Ocean in which all the universes are floating like footballs, and beyond the Causal Ocean there is an unlimited span of spiritual sky generally known as the effulgence of Brahman. Within this effulgence there are innumerable spiritual planets, and they are known as the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets. Each and every Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planet is many, many times bigger than the biggest universe within the material world, and in each of them there are innumerable inhabitants who look exactly like Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. These inhabitants are known as the Mah&#257;-pauru&#7779;ikas, or persons directly engaged in the service of the Lord. They are happy in those planets and are without any kind of misery, and they live perpetually in full youthfulness, enjoying life in full bliss and knowledge without fear of birth, death, old age or disease, and without the influence of <span class="Italic">k&#257;la,</span> eternal time.

Satyabh&#257;m&#257;'s palace was especially bedecked with valuable jewels, and even in the hottest season of summer the inside of the palace remained cool, as if air-conditioned. She decorated her palace with various flags, heralding the news of her great husband's presence there. Once, along with her husband, she met Draupad&#299;, and she was anxious to be instructed by Draupad&#299; in the ways and means of pleasing her husband. Draupad&#299; was expert in this affair because she kept five husbands, the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, and all were very much pleased with her. On receipt of Draupad&#299;'s instructions, she was very much pleased and offered her good wishes and returned to Dv&#257;rak&#257;. She was the daughter of Satr&#257;jit. After the departure of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, when Arjuna visited Dv&#257;rak&#257;, all the queens, including Satyabh&#257;m&#257; and Rukmi&#7751;&#299;, lamented for the Lord with great feeling. At the last stage of her life, she left for the forest to undergo severe penance.</div>
<div class="Purport">Satyabh&#257;m&#257; instigated her husband to get the <span class="Italic">p&#257;rij&#257;ta</span> flower from the heavenly planets, and the Lord got it even by force from the demigods, as a common husband secures things to please his wife. As already explained, the Lord had very little to do with so many wives to carry out their orders like an ordinary man. But because the queens accepted the high quality of devotional service, namely administering the Lord all comforts, the Lord played the part of a faithful and complete husband. No earthly creature can expect to have things from the heavenly kingdom, especially the <span class="Italic">p&#257;rij&#257;ta</span> flowers, which are simply to be used by the demigods. But due to their becoming the Lord's faithful wives, all of them enjoyed the special prerogatives of the great wives of the denizens of heaven. In other words, since the Lord is the proprietor of everything within His creation, it is not very astonishing for the queens of Dv&#257;rak&#257; to have any rare thing from any part of the universe.</div>

<div class="Translation">The great heroes of the Yadu dynasty, being protected by the arms of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, always remain fearless in every respect. And therefore their feet trample over the Sudharm&#257; assembly house, which the best demigods deserved but which was taken away from them.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Those who are directly servitors of the Lord are protected by the Lord from all fearfulness, and they also enjoy the best of things, even if they are forcibly accumulated. The Lord is equal in behavior to all living beings, but He is partial to His pure devotees, being very affectionate toward them. The city of Dv&#257;rak&#257; was flourishing, being enriched with the best of things in the material world. The state assembly house is constructed according to the dignity of the particular state. In the heavenly planets, the state assembly house called Sudharm&#257; was deserving of the dignity of the best of the demigods. Such an assembly house is never meant for any state on the globe because the human being on the earth is unable to construct it, however far a particular state may be materially advanced. But during the time of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's presence on the earth, the members of the Yadu family forcibly brought the celestial assembly house to earth and placed it at Dv&#257;rak&#257;. They were able to use such force because they were certain of the indulgence and protection of the Supreme Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. In other words, the Lord is provided with the best things in the universe by His pure devotees. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was provided with all kinds of comforts and facilities available within the universe by the members of the Yadu dynasty, and in return such servitors of the Lord were protected and fearless.</div>
<div class="Purport">A forgetful, conditioned soul is fearful. But a liberated soul is never fearful, just as a small child completely dependent on the mercy of his father is never fearful of anyone. Fearfulness is a sort of illusion for the living being when he is in slumber and forgetting his eternal relation with the Lord. Since the living being is never to die by his constitution, as stated in <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexd7ba.html?g=565">2.20</a>), then what is the cause of fearfulness? A person may be fearful of a tiger in a dream, but another man who is awake by his side sees no tiger there. The tiger is a myth for both of them, namely the person dreaming and the person awake, because actually there is no tiger; but the man forgetful of his awakened life is fearful, whereas the man who has not forgotten his position is not at all fearful. Thus the members of the Yadu dynasty were fully awake in their service to the Lord, and therefore there was no tiger for them to be afraid of at any time. Even if there were a real tiger, the Lord was there to protect them.</div>

<div class="Translation">Have you contacted a woman of impeachable character, or have you not properly treated a deserving woman? Or have you been defeated on the way by someone who is inferior or equal to you?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">It appears from this verse that during the time of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas free contact between man and woman was allowed in certain conditions only. The higher caste men, namely the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas,</span> could accept a woman of the <span class="Italic">vai&#347;ya</span> or the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> community, but a man from the lower castes could not contact a woman of the higher caste. Even a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> could not contact a woman of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> caste. The wife of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> is considered one of the seven mothers (namely one's own mother, the wife of the spiritual master or teacher, the wife of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> the wife of a king, the cow, the nurse, and the earth). Such contact between man and woman was known as <span class="Italic">uttama</span> and <span class="Italic">adhama.</span> Contact of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> with a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> woman is <span class="Italic">uttama,</span> but the contact of a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> with a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> woman is <span class="Italic">adhama</span> and therefore condemned. A woman approaching a man for contact should never be refused, but at the same time the discretion as above mentioned may also be considered. Bh&#299;ma was approached by Hi&#7693;imb&#299; from a community lower than the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras,</span> and Yay&#257;ti refused to marry the daughter of &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya because of &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya's being a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> Vy&#257;sadeva, a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> was called to beget P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u and Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra. Satyavat&#299; belonged to a family of fishermen, but Par&#257;&#347;ara, a great <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> begot in her Vy&#257;sadeva. So there are so many examples of contacts with woman, but in all cases the contacts were not abominable nor were the results of such contacts bad. Contact between man and woman is natural, but that also must be carried out under regulative principles so that social consecration may not be disturbed or unwanted worthless population be increased for the unrest of the world.</div>
<div class="Purport">It is abominable for a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> to be defeated by one who is inferior in strength or equal in strength. If one is defeated at all, he should be defeated by some superior power. Arjuna was defeated by Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva, and Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a saved him from the danger. This was not an insult for Arjuna because Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva was far superior to Arjuna in all ways, namely age, respect and strength. But Kar&#7751;a was equal to Arjuna, and therefore Arjuna was in crisis when fighting with Kar&#7751;a. It was felt by Arjuna, and therefore Kar&#7751;a was killed even by crooked means. Such are the engagements of the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas,</span> and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira inquired from his brother whether anything undesirable happened on the way home from Dv&#257;rak&#257;.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index8205.html?g=3654">10.41</a>) the Lord says, "Anyone specifically powerful and opulent in wealth, strength, beauty, knowledge and all that is materially desirable is to be considered but a product of an insignificant portion of the complete whole of My energy." No one, therefore, can be independently powerful in any measure without being endowed by the Lord. When the Lord descends on the earth along with His eternal ever-liberated associates, He not only displays the divine energy possessed by Himself, but also empowers His associate devotees with the required energy to execute His mission of incarnation. It is also stated in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexfea9.html?g=1468">4.5</a>) that the Lord and His eternal associates descend on the earth many times, but the Lord remembers all the different roles of incarnations, whereas the associates, by His supreme will, forget them. Similarly, the Lord takes away with Him all His associates when He disappears from the earth. The power and energy which were bestowed upon Arjuna were required for fulfillment of the mission of the Lord, but when His mission was fulfilled, the emergency powers were withdrawn from Arjuna because the astounding powers of Arjuna, which were astonishing even to the denizens of heaven, were no longer required, and they were not meant for going back home, back to Godhead. If endowment of powers and withdrawal of powers by the Lord are possible even for a great devotee like Arjuna, or even the demigods in heaven, then what to speak of the ordinary living beings who are but figs compared to such great souls. The lesson is, therefore, that no one should be puffed up for his powers borrowed from the Lord. The sane man should rather feel obliged to the Lord for such benefactions and must utilize such power for the service of the Lord. Such power can be withdrawn at any time by the Lord, so the best use of such power and opulence is to engage them in the service of the Lord.</div>

<div class="First">Draupad&#299; was the most beautiful daughter of King Drupada, and when she was a young girl almost all the princes desired her hand. But Drupada Mah&#257;r&#257;ja decided to hand over his daughter to Arjuna only and therefore contrived a peculiar way. There was a fish hanging on the inner roof of the house under the protection of a wheel. The condition was that out of the princely order, one must be able to pierce the fish's eyes through the wheel of protection, and no one would be allowed to look up at the target. On the ground there was a waterpot in which the target and wheel were reflected, and one had to fix his aim towards the target by looking at the trembling water in the pot. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Drupada well knew that only Arjuna or alternately Kar&#7751;a could successfully carry out the plan. But still he wanted to hand his daughter to Arjuna. And in the assembly of the princely order, when Dh&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;adyumna, the brother of Draupad&#299;, introduced all the princes to his grown-up sister, Kar&#7751;a was also present in the game. But Draupad&#299; tactfully avoided Kar&#7751;a as the rival of Arjuna, and she expressed her desires through her brother Dh&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;adyumna that she was unable to accept anyone who was less than a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya.</span> The <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas</span> and the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> are less important than the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas.</span> Kar&#7751;a was known as the son of a carpenter, a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra.</span> So Draupad&#299; avoided Kar&#7751;a by this plea.

And only by His grace was the demon named Maya saved from the blazing Kh&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ava Forest, and thus we could build our assembly house of wonderful architectural workmanship, where all the princes assembled during the performance of R&#257;jas&#363;ya-yaj&ntilde;a and paid you tributes.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The demon Maya D&#257;nava was an inhabitant of the forest Kh&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ava, and when the Kh&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ava Forest was set on fire, he asked protection from Arjuna. Arjuna saved his life, and as a result of this the demon felt obliged. He reciprocated by building a wonderful assembly house for the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, which attracted the extraordinary attention of all state princes. They felt the supernatural power of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, and thus without grudge all of them submitted and paid tributes to the Emperor. The demons possess wonderful and supernatural powers to create material wonders. But they are always disturbing elements of the society. The modern demons are the harmful material scientists who create some material wonders for disturbance in the society. For example, the creation of nuclear weapons has caused some panic in human society. Maya was also a materialist like that, and he knew the art of creating such wonderful things. And yet Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a wanted to kill him. When he was chased both by the fire and by the wheel of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, he took shelter of such a devotee as Arjuna, who saved him from the wrath of the fire of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Devotees are therefore more merciful than the Lord, and in devotional service the mercy of a devotee is more valuable than the mercy of the Lord. Both the fire and the Lord ceased from chasing the demon as soon as both of them saw that the demon was given shelter by such a devotee as Arjuna. This demon, feeling obliged to Arjuna, wanted to do him some service to show his gratefulness, but Arjuna declined to accept anything from him in exchange. Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, however, being pleased with Maya for his taking shelter of a devotee, asked him to render service unto King Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira by building a wonderful assembly house. The process is that by the grace of the devotee the mercy of the Lord is obtained, and by the mercy of the Lord a chance to serve the Lord's devotee is obtained. The club of Bh&#299;masena was also a gift of Maya D&#257;nava.</div>

These kings had been brought for sacrifice in Jar&#257;sandha's Mah&#257;bhairava-yaj&ntilde;a, but they were thus released. Later they paid tribute to Your Majesty.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Jar&#257;sandha was a very powerful king of Magadha, and the history of his birth and activities is also very interesting. His father, King B&#7771;hadratha, was also a very prosperous and powerful King of Magadha, but he had no son, although he married two daughters of the King of K&#257;&#347;&#299;. Being disappointed in not getting a son from either of the two queens, the King, along with his wives, left home to live in the forest for austerities, but in the forest he was blessed by one great <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;i</span> to have a son, and he gave him one mango to be eaten by the queens. The queens did so and were very soon pregnant. The King was very happy to see the queens bearing children, but when the ripe time approached, the queens delivered one child in two parts, one from each of the queens' wombs. The two parts were thrown in the forest, where a great she-demon used to live, and she was glad to have some delicate flesh and blood from the newly born child. Out of curiosity she joined the two parts, and the child became complete and regained life. The she-demon was known as Jar&#257;, and being compassionate on the childless King, she went to the King and presented him with the nice child, The King was very pleased with the she-demon and wanted to reward her according to her desire. The she-demon expressed her desire that the child be named after her, and thus the child was surnamed Jar&#257;sandha, or one who was joined by Jar&#257;, the she-demon. In fact, this Jar&#257;sandha was born as one of the parts and parcels of the demon Vipracitti. The saint by whose benedictions the queens bore the child was called Candra Kau&#347;ika, who foretold of the child before his father B&#7771;hadratha.</div>
<div class="Purport">Since he possessed demoniac qualities from birth, naturally he became a great devotee of Lord &#346;iva, who is the lord of all ghostly and demoniac men. R&#257;va&#7751;a was a great devotee of Lord &#346;iva, and so also King Jar&#257;sandha. He used to sacrifice all arrested kings before Lord Mah&#257;bhairava (&#346;iva) and by his military power he defeated many small kings and arrested them to butcher before Mah&#257;bhairava. There are many devotees of Lord Mah&#257;bhairava, or K&#257;labhairava, in the province of Bihar, formerly called Magadha. Jar&#257;sandha was a relative of Ka&#7745;sa, the maternal uncle of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and therefore after Ka&#7745;sa's death King Jar&#257;sandha became a great enemy of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and there were many fights between Jar&#257;sandha and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a wanted to kill him, but He also wanted that those who served as military men for Jar&#257;sandha might not be killed. Therefore a plan was adopted to kill him. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Bh&#299;ma and Arjuna together went to Jar&#257;sandha in the dress of poor <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and begged charity from King Jar&#257;sandha. Jar&#257;sandha never refused charity to any <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> and he performed many sacrifices also, yet he was not on a par with devotional service. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Bh&#299;ma and Arjuna asked Jar&#257;sandha for the facility of fighting him, and it was settled that Jar&#257;sandha would fight with Bh&#299;ma only. So all of them were both guests and combatants of Jar&#257;sandha, and Bh&#299;ma and Jar&#257;sandha fought every day for several days. Bh&#299;ma became disappointed, but K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a gave him hints about Jar&#257;sandha's being joined together as an infant, and thus Bh&#299;ma dissected him again and so killed him. All the kings who were detained in the concentration camp to be killed before Mah&#257;bhairava were thus released by Bh&#299;ma. Feeling thus obliged to the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, they paid tribute to King Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira.</div>

Thus after the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra, after all the sons and grandsons of Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra died in battle, all the wives of the family were obliged to loosen their hair as widows. In other words, all the wives of the Kuru family became widows because of Du&#7717;&#347;&#257;sana's insulting a great devotee of the Lord. The Lord can tolerate insults upon Himself by any miscreant because the father tolerates even insults from the son. But He never tolerates insults upon His devotees. By insulting a great soul, one has to forego all the results of pious acts and benedictions also.</div>

<div class="Translation">During our exile, Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni, who eats with his ten thousand disciples, intrigued with our enemies to put us in dangerous trouble. At that time He [Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a], simply by accepting the remnants of food, saved us. By His accepting food thus, the assembly of munis, while bathing in the river, felt sumptuously fed. And all the three worlds were also satisfied.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First"><span class="Italic">Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni:</span> A powerful mystic <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> determined to observe the principles of religion with great vows and under strict austerities. His name is associated with many historical events, and it appears that the great mystic could be both easily satisfied and easily annoyed, like Lord &#346;iva. When he was satisfied, he could do tremendous good to the servitor, but if he was dissatisfied he could bring about the greatest calamity. Kum&#257;r&#299; Kunt&#299;, at her father's house, used to minister all kinds of services to all great <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> and being satisfied with her good reception Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni blessed her with a power to call any demigod she desired. It is understood that he was a plenary incarnation of Lord &#346;iva, and thus he could be either easily satisfied or annoyed. He was a great devotee of Lord &#346;iva, and by Lord &#346;iva's order he accepted the priesthood of King &#346;vetaketu because of the King's performance of sacrifice for one hundred years. Sometimes he used to visit the parliamentary assembly of the heavenly kingdom of Indradeva. He could travel in space by his great mystic powers, and it is understood that he traveled a great distance through space, even up to the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets beyond material space. He traveled all these long distances within one year, during his quarrel with King Ambar&#299;&#7779;a, the great devotee and Emperor of the world.</div>
<div class="Purport">He had about ten thousand disciples, and wherever he visited and became a guest of the great <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> kings, he used to be accompanied by a number of followers. Once he visited the house of Duryodhana, the enemy cousin of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira. Duryodhana was intelligent enough to satisfy the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> by all means, and the great <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;i</span> wanted to give some benediction to Duryodhana. Duryodhana knew his mystic powers, and he knew also that the mystic <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> if dissatisfied, could cause some havoc, and thus he designed to engage the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> to show his wrath upon his enemy cousins, the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas. When the <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;i</span> wanted to award some benediction to Duryodhana, the latter wished that he should visit the house of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, who was the eldest and chief among all his cousins. But by his request he would go to him after he had finished his meals with his Queen, Draupad&#299;. Duryodhana knew that after Draupad&#299;'s dinner it would be impossible for Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira to receive such a large number of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> guests, and thus the <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;i</span> would be annoyed and would create some trouble for his cousin Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira. That was the plan of Duryodhana. Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni agreed to this proposal, and he approached the King in exile, according to the plan of Duryodhana, after the King and Draupad&#299; had finished their meals.</div>
<div class="Purport">On his arrival at the door of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, he was at once well received, and the King requested him to finish his noontime religious rites in the river, for by that time the foodstuff would be prepared. Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni, along with his large number of disciples, went to take a bath in the river, and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira was in great anxiety about the guests. As long as Draupad&#299; had not taken her meals, food could be served to any number of guests, but the <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;i,</span> by the plan of Duryodhana, reached there after Draupad&#299; had finished her meals.</div>
<div class="Purport">When the devotees are put into difficulty, they have an opportunity to recollect the Lord with rapt attention. So Draupad&#299; was thinking of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in that dangerous position, and the all-pervading Lord could at once know the dangerous position of His devotees. He therefore came there on the scene and asked Draupad&#299; to give whatever food she might have in her stock. On her being so requested by the Lord, Draupad&#299; was sorrowful because the Supreme Lord asked her for some food and she was unable to supply it at that time. She said to the Lord that the mysterious dish which she had received from the sun-god could supply any amount of food if she herself had not eaten. But on that day she had already taken her meals, and thus they were in danger. By expressing her difficulties she began to cry before the Lord as only a woman would do in such a position. The Lord, however, asked Draupad&#299; to bring up the cooking pots to see if there was any particle of foodstuff left, and on Draupad&#299;'s doing so, the Lord found some particle of vegetable sticking to the pot. The Lord at once picked it up and ate it. After doing so, the Lord asked Draupad&#299; to call for her guests, the company of Durv&#257;s&#257;.</div>
<div class="Purport">Bh&#299;ma was sent to call them from the river. Bh&#299;ma said, "Why are you delaying, sirs? Come on, the food is ready for you." But the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> because of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's accepting a little particle of food, felt sumptuously fed, even while they were in the water. They thought that since Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira must have prepared many valuable dishes for them and since they were not hungry and could not eat, the King would feel very sorry, so it was better not to go there. Thus they decided to go away.</div>
<div class="Purport">This incident proves that the Lord is the greatest mystic, and therefore He is known as Yoge&#347;vara. Another instruction is that every householder must offer food to the Lord, and the result will be that everyone, even a company of guests numbering ten thousand, will be satisfied because of the Lord's being satisfied. That is the way of devotional service.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">It was by His influence only that in a fight I was able to astonish the personality of god Lord &#346;iva and his wife, the daughter of Mount Himalaya. Thus he [Lord &#346;iva] became pleased with me and awarded me his own weapon. Other demigods also delivered their respective weapons to me, and in addition I was able to reach the heavenly planets in this present body and was allowed a half-elevated seat.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">By the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, all the demigods, including Lord &#346;iva, were pleased with Arjuna. The idea is that one who is favored by Lord &#346;iva or any other demigod may not necessarily be favored by the Supreme Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. R&#257;va&#7751;a was certainly a great devotee of Lord &#346;iva, but he could not be saved from the wrath of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord R&#257;macandra. And there are many instances like that in the histories of the <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as.</span> But here is an instance where we can see that Lord &#346;iva became pleased even in the fight with Arjuna. The devotees of the Supreme Lord know how to respect the demigods, but the devotees of the demigods sometimes foolishly think that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is no greater than the demigods. By such a conception, one becomes an offender and ultimately meets with the same end as R&#257;va&#7751;a and others. The instances described by Arjuna during his friendly dealings with Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a are instructive for all who may be convinced by the lessons that one can achieve all favors simply by pleasing the Supreme Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, whereas the devotees or worshipers of the demigods may achieve only partial benefits, which are also perishable, just as the demigods themselves are.</div>
<div class="Purport">Another significance of the present verse is that Arjuna, by the grace of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, was able to reach the heavenly planet even with the selfsame body and was honored by the heavenly demigod Indradeva, being seated with him half-elevated. One can reach the heavenly planets by the pious acts recommended in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> in the category of fruitive activities. And as stated in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index1885.html?g=3174">9.21</a>), when the reactions of such pious acts are spent, the enjoyer is again degraded to this earthly planet. The moon is also on the level with the heavenly planets, and only persons who have performed virtues only-performing sacrifices, giving charity and undergoing severe austerities-can be allowed to enter into the heavenly planets after the duration of life of the body. Arjuna was allowed to enter into the heavenly planets in the selfsame body simply by the grace of the Lord, otherwise it is not possible to do so. The present attempts to enter into the heavenly planets by the modern scientists will certainly prove futile because such scientists are not on the level of Arjuna. They are ordinary human beings, without any assets of sacrifice, charity or austerities. The material body is influenced by the three modes of material nature, namely goodness, passion and ignorance. The present population is more or less influenced by the modes of passion and ignorance, and the symptoms for such influence are exhibited in their becoming very lusty and greedy. Such degraded fellows can hardly approach the higher planetary systems. Above the heavenly planets there are many other planets also, which only those who are influenced by goodness can reach. In heavenly and other planets within the universe, the inhabitants are all highly intelligent, many more times than the human beings, and they are all pious in the higher and highest mode of goodness. They are all devotees of the Lord, and although their goodness is not unadulterated, still they are known as demigods possessing the maximum amount of good qualities possible within the material world.</div>

<div class="First">The heavenly demigods are certainly more intelligent, powerful and beautiful, and yet they had to take help from Arjuna because of his G&#257;&#7751;&#7693;&#299;va bow, which was empowered by the grace of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The Lord is all-powerful, and by His grace His pure devotee can be as powerful as He may desire, and there is no limit to it. And when the Lord withdraws His power from anyone, he is powerless by the will of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation">The military strength of the Kauravas was like an ocean in which there dwelled many invincible existences, and thus it was insurmountable. But because of His friendship, I, seated on the chariot, was able to cross over it. And only by His grace was I able to regain the cows and also collect by force many helmets of the kings which were bedecked with jewels that were sources of all brilliance.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">On the Kaurava side there were many stalwart commanders like Bh&#299;&#7779;ma, Dro&#7751;a, K&#7771;pa and Kar&#7751;a, and their military strength was as insurmountable as the great ocean. And yet it was due to Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's grace that Arjuna alone, sitting on the chariot, could manage to vanquish them one after another without difficulty. There were many changes of commanders on the other side, but on the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas' side Arjuna alone on the chariot driven by Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a could manage the whole responsibility of the great war. Similarly, when the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas were living at the palace of Vir&#257;&#7789;a incognito, the Kauravas picked a quarrel with King Vir&#257;&#7789;a and decided to take away his large number of cows. While they were taking away the cows, Arjuna fought with them incognito and was able to regain the cows along with some booty taken by force-the jewels set on the turbans of the royal order. Arjuna remembered that all this was possible by the grace of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation">It was He only who withdrew the duration of life from everyone and who, in the battlefield, withdrew the speculative power and strength of enthusiasm from the great military phalanx made by the Kauravas, headed by Bh&#299;&#7779;ma, Kar&#7751;a, Dro&#7751;a, &#346;alya, etc. Their arrangement was expert and more than adequate, but He [Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a], while going forward, did all this.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Absolute Personality of Godhead, Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, expands Himself by His plenary Param&#257;tm&#257; portion in everyone s heart, and thus He directs everyone in the matter of recollection, forgetfulness, knowledge, the absence of intelligence and all psychological activities (Bg. <a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a>). As the Supreme Lord, He can increase or decrease the duration of life of a living being. Thus the Lord conducted the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra according to His own plan. He wanted that battle to establish Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira as the Emperor of this planet, and to facilitate this transcendental business He killed all who were on the opposite party by His omnipotent will. The other party was equipped with all military strength supported by big generals like Bh&#299;&#7779;ma, Dro&#7751;a and &#346;alya and it would have been physically impossible for Arjuna to win the battle had the Lord not helped him by every kind of tactic. Such tactics are generally followed by every statesman, even in modern warfare, but they are all done materially by powerful espionages, military tactics and diplomatic maneuvers. But because Arjuna was the Lord's affectionate devotee, the Lord did all this Himself without personal anxiety by Arjuna. That is the way of the devotional service to the Lord.</div>

But by His [Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's] grace they could not even touch a hair on my head. Similarly, Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, the supreme devotee of Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva, was unaffected by the weapons the demons used against him.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The history of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, the great devotee of N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva, is narrated in the Seventh Canto of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, a small child of only five years, became the object of envy for his great father, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, only because of his becoming a pure devotee of the Lord. The demon father employed all his weapons to kill the devotee son, Prahl&#257;da, but by the grace of the Lord he was saved from all sorts of dangerous actions by his father. He was thrown in a fire, in boiling oil, from the top of a hill, underneath the legs of an elephant, and he was administered poison. At last the father himself took up a chopper to kill his son, and thus N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva appeared and killed the heinous father in the presence of the son. Thus no one can kill the devotee of the Lord. Similarly, Arjuna was also saved by the Lord, although all dangerous weapons were employed by his great opponents like Bh&#299;&#7779;ma.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Kar&#7751;a:</span> Born of Kunt&#299; by the sun-god prior to her marriage with Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u, Kar&#7751;a took his birth with bangles and earrings, extraordinary signs for an undaunted hero. In the beginning his name was Vasusena, but when he grew up he presented his natural bangles and earrings to Indradeva, and thenceforward he became known as Vaikartana. After his birth from the maiden Kunt&#299;, he was thrown in the Ganges. Later he was picked up by Adhiratha, and he and his wife R&#257;dh&#257; brought him up as their own offspring. Kar&#7751;a was very charitable, especially toward the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> There was nothing he could not spare for a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> In the same charitable spirit he gave in charity his natural bangles and earrings to Indradeva, who, being very much satisfied with him, gave him in return a great weapon called &#346;akti. He was admitted as one of the students of Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya, and from the very beginning there was some rivalry between him and Arjuna. Seeing his constant rivalry with Arjuna, Duryodhana picked him up as his companion, and this gradually grew into greater intimacy. He was also present in the great assembly of Draupad&#299;'s <span class="Italic">svaya&#7745;vara</span> function, and when he attempted to exhibit his talent in that meeting, Draupad&#299;'s brother declared that Kar&#7751;a could not take part in the competition because of his being the son of a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> carpenter. Although he was refused in the competition, still when Arjuna was successful in piercing the fish target on the ceiling and Draupad&#299; bestowed her garland upon Arjuna, Kar&#7751;a and the other disappointed princes offered an unusual stumbling block to Arjuna while he was leaving with Draupad&#299;. Specifically, Kar&#7751;a fought with him very valiantly, but all of them were defeated by Arjuna. Duryodhana was very much pleased with Kar&#7751;a because of his constant rivalry with Arjuna, and when he was in power he enthroned Kar&#7751;a in the state of A&#7749;ga. Being baffled in his attempt to win Draupad&#299;, Kar&#7751;a advised Duryodhana to attack King Drupada, for after defeating him both Arjuna and Draupad&#299; could be arrested. But Dro&#7751;&#257;c&#257;rya rebuked them for this conspiracy, and they refrained from the action. Kar&#7751;a was defeated many times, not only by Arjuna but also by Bh&#299;masena. He was the king of the kingdom of Bengal, Orissa and Madras combined. Later on he took an active part in the R&#257;jas&#363;ya sacrifice of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, and when there was gambling between the rival brothers, designed by &#346;akuni, Kar&#7751;a took part in the game, and he was very pleased when Draupad&#299; was offered as a bet in the gambling. This fed his old grudge. When Draupad&#299; was in the game he was very enthusiastic to declare the news, and it is he who ordered Du&#7717;&#347;&#257;sana to take away the garments of both the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas and Draupad&#299;. He asked Draupad&#299; to select another husband because, being lost by the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, she was rendered a slave of the Kurus. He was always an enemy of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, and whenever there was an opportunity, he tried to curb them by all means. During the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra, he foresaw the conclusive result, and he expressed his opinion that due to Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's being the chariot driver of Arjuna, the battle should be won by Arjuna. He always differed with Bh&#299;&#7779;ma, and sometimes he was proud enough to say that within five days he could finish up the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, if Bh&#299;&#7779;ma would not interfere with his plan of action. But he was much mortified when Bh&#299;&#7779;ma died. He killed Gha&#7789;otkaca with the &#346;akti weapon obtained from Indradeva. His son, Brisasena, was killed by Arjuna. He killed the largest number of P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ava soldiers. At last there was a severe fight with Arjuna, and it was he only who was able to knock off the helmet of Arjuna. But it so happened that the wheel of his chariot stuck in the battlefield mud, and when he got down to set the wheel right, Arjuna took the opportunity and killed him, although he requested Arjuna not to do so.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Napt&#257;,</span> or <span class="Italic">Bh&#363;ri&#347;rav&#257;:</span> Bh&#363;ri&#347;rav&#257; was the son of Somadatta, a member of the Kuru family. His other brother was &#346;alya. Both the brothers and the father attended the <span class="Italic">svaya&#7745;vara</span> ceremony of Draupad&#299;. All of them appreciated the wonderful strength of Arjuna due to his being the devotee friend of the Lord, and thus Bh&#363;ri&#347;rav&#257; advised the sons of Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra not to pick any quarrel or fight with them. All of them also attended the R&#257;jas&#363;ya <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a</span> of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira. He possessed one <span class="Italic">ak&#7779;auhi&#7751;&#299;</span> regiment of army, cavalry, elephants and chariots, and all these were employed in the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra on behalf of Duryodhana's party. He was counted by Bh&#299;ma as one of the <span class="Italic">y&#363;tha-patis.</span> In the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra he was especially engaged in a fight with S&#257;tyaki, and he killed ten sons of S&#257;tyaki. Later on, Arjuna cut off his hands, and he was ultimately killed by S&#257;tyaki. After his death he merged into the existence of Vi&#347;vadeva.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Trigarta,</span> or <span class="Italic">Su&#347;arm&#257;:</span> Son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja V&#7771;ddhak&#7779;etra, he was the King of Trigartade&#347;a, and he was also present in the <span class="Italic">svaya&#7745;vara</span> ceremony of Draupad&#299;. He was one of the allies of Duryodhana, and he advised Duryodhana to attack the Matsyade&#347;a (Darbha&#7749;ga). During the time of cow-stealing in Vir&#257;&#7789;a-nagara, he was able to arrest Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Vir&#257;&#7789;a, but later Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Vir&#257;&#7789;a was released by Bh&#299;ma. In the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra he also fought very valiantly, but at the end he was killed by Arjuna.</div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Jayadratha:</span> Another son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja V&#7771;ddhak&#7779;etra. He was the King of Sindhude&#347;a (modern Sind Pakistan). His wife's name was Du&#7717;&#347;al&#257;. He was also present in the <span class="Italic">svaya&#7745;vara</span> ceremony of Draupad&#299;, and he desired very strongly to have her hand, but he failed in the competition. But since then he always sought the opportunity to get in touch with Draupad&#299;. When he was going to marry in the &#346;alyade&#347;a, on the way to K&#257;myavana he happened to see Draupad&#299; again and was too much attracted to her. The P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas and Draupad&#299; were then in exile, after losing their empire in gambling, and Jayadratha thought it wise to send news to Draupad&#299; in an illicit manner through Ko&#7789;i&#347;a&#7779;ya, one of his associates. Draupad&#299; at once refused vehemently the proposal of Jayadratha, but being so much attracted by the beauty of Draupad&#299;, he tried again and again. Every time he was refused by Draupad&#299;. He tried to take her away forcibly on his chariot, and at first Draupad&#299; gave him a good dashing, and he fell like a cut-root tree. But he was not discouraged, and he was able to force Draupad&#299; to sit on the chariot. This incident was seen by Dhaumya Muni, and he strongly protested the action of Jayadratha. He also followed the chariot, and through Dh&#257;treyik&#257; the matter was brought to the notice of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira. The P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas then attacked the soldiers of Jayadratha and killed them all, and at last Bh&#299;ma caught hold of Jayadratha and beat him very severely, almost dead. Then all but five hairs were cut off his head and he was taken to all the kings and introduced as the slave of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira. He was forced to admit himself to be the slave of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira before all the princely order, and in the same condition he was brought before Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira was kind enough to order him released, and when he admitted to being a tributary prince under Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, Queen Draupad&#299; also desired his release. After this incident, he was allowed to return to his country. Being so insulted, he went to Ga&#7749;g&#257;tri in the Himalayas and undertook a severe type of penance to please Lord &#346;iva. He asked his benediction to defeat all the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, at least one at a time. Then the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra began, and he took sides with Duryodhana. In the first day's fight he was engaged with Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Drupada, then with Vir&#257;&#7789;a and then with Abhimanyu. While Abhimanyu was being killed, mercilessly surrounded by seven great generals, the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas came to his help, but Jayadratha, by the mercy of Lord &#346;iva, repulsed them with great ability. At this, Arjuna took a vow to kill him, and on hearing this, Jayadratha wanted to leave the warfield and asked permission from the Kauravas for this cowardly action. But he was not allowed to do so. On the contrary, he was obliged to fight with Arjuna, and while the fight was going on Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a reminded Arjuna that the benediction of &#346;iva upon Jayadratha was that whoever would cause his head to fall on the ground would die at once. He therefore advised Arjuna to throw the head of Jayadratha directly onto the lap of his father, who was engaged in penances at the Samanta-pa&ntilde;caka pilgrimage. This was actually done by Arjuna. Jayadratha's father was surprised to see a severed head on his lap, and he at once threw it to the ground. The father immediately died, his forehead being cracked in seven pieces.</div>

<div class="Translation">It was by His mercy only that my enemies neglected to kill me when I descended from my chariot to get water for my thirsty horses. And it was due to my lack of esteem for my Lord that I dared engage Him as my chariot driver, for He is worshiped and offered services by the best men to attain salvation.</div>

<div class="First">The Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, is the object of worship both by impersonalists and by the devotees of the Lord. The impersonalists worship His glowing effulgence, emanating from His transcendental body of eternal form, bliss and knowledge, and the devotees worship Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Those who are below even the impersonalists consider Him to be one of the great historical personalities. The Lord, however, descends to attract all by His specific transcendental pastimes, and thus He plays the part of the most perfect master, friend, son and lover. His transcendental relation with Arjuna was in friendship, and the Lord therefore played the part perfectly, as He did with His parents, lovers and wives. While playing in such a perfect transcendental relation, the devotee forgets, by the internal potency of the Lord, that his friend or son is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although sometimes the devotee is bewildered by the acts of the Lord. After the departure of the Lord, Arjuna was conscious of his great friend, but there was no mistake on the part of Arjuna, nor any ill estimation of the Lord. Intelligent men are attracted by the transcendental acting of the Lord with a pure, unalloyed devotee like Arjuna.</div>
<div class="Purport">In the warfield, scarcity of water is a well-known fact. Water is very rare there, and both the animals and men, working strenuously on the warfield, constantly require water to quench their thirst. Especially wounded soldiers and generals feel very thirsty at the time of death, and it sometimes so happens that simply for want of water one has to die unavoidably. But such scarcity of water was solved in the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra by means of boring the ground. By God's grace, water can be easily obtained from any place if there is facility for boring the ground. The modern system works on the same principle of boring the ground, but modern engineers are still unable to dig immediately wherever necessary. It appears, however, from the history as far back as the days of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, that big generals like Arjuna could at once supply water even to the horses, and what to speak of men, by drawing water from underneath the hard ground simply by penetrating the stratum with a sharp arrow, a method still unknown to the modern scientists.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The important point in this verse is how it was possible that Arjuna could be defeated by a gang of ignoble cowherd men and how such mundane cowherd men could touch the bodies of the wives of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who were under the protection of Arjuna. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura has justified the contradiction by research in the <span class="Italic">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">Brahma Pur&#257;&#7751;a.</span> In these <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> it is said that once the fair denizens of heaven pleased A&#7779;&#7789;&#257;vakra Muni by their service and were blessed by the <span class="Italic">muni</span> to have the Supreme Lord as their husband. A&#7779;&#7789;&#257;vakra Muni was curved in eight joints of his body, and thus he used to move in a peculiar curved manner. The daughters of the demigods could not check their laughter upon seeing the movements of the <span class="Italic">muni,</span> and the <span class="Italic">muni,</span> being angry at them, cursed them that they would be kidnapped by rogues, even if they would get the Lord as their husband. Later on, the girls again satisfied the <span class="Italic">muni</span> by their prayers, and the <span class="Italic">muni</span> blessed them that they would regain their husband even after being robbed by the rogues. So, in order to keep the words of the great <span class="Italic">muni,</span> the Lord Himself kidnapped His wives from the protection of Arjuna, otherwise they would have at once vanished from the scene as soon as they were touched by the rogues. Besides that, some of the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> who prayed to become wives of the Lord returned to their respective positions after their desire was fulfilled. After the departure of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, He wanted all His entourage back to Godhead, and they were called back under different conditions only.</div>

Human civilization and all activities thereof must be dovetailed with the supreme blessing of the Lord, and without this blessing all advancement of human civilization is like decoration on a dead body.

<div class="First">According to the anthropologists, there is nature's law of struggle for existence and survival of the fittest. But they do not know that behind the law of nature is the supreme direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is confirmed that the law of nature is executed under the direction of the Lord. Whenever, therefore, there is peace in the world, it must be known that it is due to the good will of the Lord. And whenever there is upheaval in the world, it is also due to the supreme will of the Lord. Not a blade of grass moves without the will of the Lord. Whenever, therefore, there is disobedience of the established rules enacted by the Lord, there is war between men and nations. The surest way to the path of peace, therefore, is dovetailing everything to the established rule of the Lord. The established rule is that whatever we do, whatever we eat, whatever we sacrifice or whatever we give in charity must be done to the full satisfaction of the Lord. No one should do anything, eat anything, sacrifice anything or give anything in charity against the will of the Lord. Discretion is the better part of valor, and one must learn how to discriminate between actions which may be pleasing to the Lord and those which may not be pleasing to the Lord. An action is thus judged by the Lord's pleasure or displeasure. There is no room for personal whims; we must always be guided by the pleasure of the Lord. Such action is called <span class="Italic">yoga&#7717; karmasu kau&#347;alam </I>[</span><I>Bg</I>. <a href="index7ebc.html?g=830">2.50</a></I>]<span class="Italic"></I>,</span> or actions performed which are linked with the Supreme Lord.

<div class="First">In the material world the struggle for existence and survival of the fittest are laws because in the material world there is disparity between conditioned souls due to everyone's desire to lord it over the material resources. This very mentality of lording it over the material nature is the root cause of conditioned life. And to give facility to such imitation lords, the illusory energy of the Lord has created a disparity between conditioned living beings by creating the stronger and the weaker in every species of life. The mentality of lording it over the material nature and the creation has naturally created a disparity and therefore the law of struggle for existence. In the spiritual world there is no such disparity, nor is there such a struggle for existence. In the spiritual world there is no struggle for existence because everyone there exists eternally. There is no disparity because everyone wants to render service to the Supreme Lord, and no one wants to imitate the Lord in becoming the beneficiary. The Lord, being creator of everything, including the living beings, factually is the proprietor and enjoyer of everything that be, but in the material world, by the spell of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> or illusion, this eternal relation with the Supreme Personality of Godhead is forgotten, and so the living being is conditioned under the law of struggle for existence and survival of the fittest.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Herein Arjuna refers to the instruction of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> which was imparted to him by the Lord on the Battlefield of Kuruk&#7779;etra. The Lord left behind Him the instructions of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> not for the benefit of Arjuna alone, but also for all time and in all lands. The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> being spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the essence of all Vedic wisdom. It is nicely presented by the Lord Himself for all who have very little time to go through the vast Vedic literatures like the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads, Pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> and <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tras.</span> It is put within the study of the great historical epic <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata,</span> which was especially prepared for the less intelligent class, namely the women, the laborers and those who are worthless descendants of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as, k&#7779;atriyas</span> and higher sections of the <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas.</span> The problem which arose in the heart of Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kuruk&#7779;etra was solved by the teachings of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> Again, after the departure of the Lord from the vision of earthly people, when Arjuna was face to face with being vanquished in his acquired power and prominence, he wanted again to remember the great teachings of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> just to teach all concerned that the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> can be consulted in all critical times, not only for solace from all kinds of mental agonies, but also for the way out of great entanglements which may embarrass one in some critical hour.</div>
<div class="Purport">The merciful Lord left behind Him the great teachings of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> so that one can take the instructions of the Lord even when He is not visible to material eyesight. Material senses cannot have any estimation of the Supreme Lord, but by His inconceivable power the Lord can incarnate Himself to the sense perception of the conditioned souls in a suitable manner through the agency of matter, which is also another form of the Lord's manifested energy. Thus the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> or any authentic scriptural sound representation of the Lord, is also the incarnation of the Lord. There is no difference between the sound representation of the Lord and the Lord Himself. One can derive the same benefit from the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as Arjuna did in the personal presence of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purport"><JD:"Destination-240">The faithful human being who is desirous of being liberated from the clutches of material existence can very easily take advantage of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> and with this in view, the Lord instructed Arjuna as if Arjuna were in need of it. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> five important factors of knowledge have been delineated pertaining to (1) the Supreme Lord, (2) the living being, (3) nature, (4) time and space and (5) the process of activity. Out of these, the Supreme Lord and the living being are qualitatively one. The difference between the two has been analyzed as the difference between the whole and the part and parcel. Nature is inert matter displaying the interaction of three different modes, and eternal time and unlimited space are considered to be beyond the existence of the material nature. Activities of the living being are different varieties of aptitudes which can entrap or liberate the living being within and without material nature. All these subject matters are concisely discussed in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> and later the subject matters are elaborated in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> for further enlightenment. Out of the five subjects, the Supreme Lord, the living entity, nature, and time and space are eternal, but the living entity, nature and time are under the direction of the Supreme Lord, who is absolute and completely independent of any other control. The Supreme Lord is the supreme controller. The material activity of the living being is beginningless, but it can be rectified by transferral into the spiritual quality. Thus it can cease its material qualitative reactions. Both the Lord and the living entity are cognizant, and both have the sense of identification, of being conscious as a living force. But the living being under the condition of material nature, called <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva,</span> misidentifies himself as being different from the Lord. The whole scheme of Vedic wisdom is targeted to the aim of eradicating such a misconception and thus liberating the living being from the illusion of material identification. When such an illusion is eradicated by knowledge and renunciation, the living beings are responsible actors and enjoyers also. The sense of enjoyment in the Lord is real, but such a sense in the living being is a sort of wishful desire only. This difference in consciousness is the distinction of the two identities, namely the Lord and the living being. Otherwise there is no difference between the Lord and the living being. The living being is therefore eternally one and different simultaneously. The whole instruction of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> stands on this principle.</div>
<div class="Purport">In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the Lord and the living beings are both described as <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana,</span> or eternal, and the Lord's abode, far beyond the material sky, is also described as <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana.</span> The living being is invited to live in the <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana</span> existence of the Lord, and the process which can help a living being to approach the Lord's abode, where the liberated activity of the soul is exhibited, is called <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana-dharma.</span> One cannot, however, reach the eternal abode of the Lord without being free from the misconception of material identification, and the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> gives us the clue how to achieve this stage of perfection. The process of being liberated from the misconception of material identification is called, in different stages, fruitive activity, empiric philosophy and devotional service, up to transcendental realization. Such transcendental realization is made possible by dovetailing all the above items in relation with the Lord. Prescribed duties of the human being, as directed in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> can gradually purify the sinful mind of the conditioned soul and raise him to the stage of knowledge. The purified stage of acquiring knowledge becomes the basis of devotional service to the Lord. As long as one is engaged in researching the solution of the problems of life, his knowledge is called <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na,</span> or purified knowledge, but on realizing the actual solution of life, one becomes situated in the devotional service of the Lord. The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> begins with the problems of life by discriminating the soul from the elements of matter and proves by all reason and argument that the soul is indestructible in all circumstances and that the outer covering of matter, the body and the mind, change for another term of material existence which is full of miseries. The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> is therefore meant for terminating all different types of miseries, and Arjuna took shelter of this great knowledge, which had been imparted to him during the Kuruk&#7779;etra battle.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Since the Lord is absolute, deep meditation upon Him is as good as yogic trance. The Lord is nondifferent from His name, form, quality, pastimes, entourage and specific actions. Arjuna began to think of the Lord's instructions to him on the Battlefield of Kuruk&#7779;etra. Only those instructions began to eliminate the tinges of material contamination in the mind of Arjuna. The Lord is like the sun; the sun's appearance means immediate dissipation of darkness, or ignorance, and the Lord's appearance within the mind of the devotee can at once drive away the miserable material effects. Lord Caitanya has therefore recommended constant chanting of the name of the Lord for protection from all contamination of the material world. The feeling of separation from the Lord is undoubtedly painful to the devotee, but because it is in connection with the Lord, it has a specific transcendental effect which pacifies the heart. Feelings of separation are also sources of transcendental bliss, and they are never comparable to contaminated material feelings of separation.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Because of his possessing spiritual assets, the doubts of duality were completely cut off. Thus he was freed from the three modes of material nature and placed in transcendence. There was no longer any chance of his becoming entangled in birth and death, for he was freed from material form.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Doubts of duality begin from the misconception of the material body, which is accepted as the self by less intelligent persons. The most foolish part of our ignorance is our identifying this material body with the self. Everything in relation with the body is ignorantly accepted as our own. Doubts due to misconceptions of myself and mine-in other words, my body, my relatives, my property, my wife, my children, my wealth, my country, my community, and hundreds and thousands of similar illusory contemplations-cause bewilderment for the conditioned soul. By assimilating the instructions of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> one is sure to be released from such bewilderment because real knowledge is knowledge that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, V&#257;sudeva, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, is everything, including one's self. Everything is a manifestation of His potency as part and parcel. The potency and the potent are nondifferent, so the conception of duality is at once mitigated by attainment of perfect knowledge. As soon as Arjuna took up the instructions of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> expert as he was, he could at once eradicate the material conception of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, his eternal friend. He could realize that the Lord was still present before him by His instruction, by His form, by His pastimes, by His qualities and everything else related to Him. He could realize that Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, his friend, was still present before him by His transcendental presence in different nondual energies, and there was no question of attainment of the association of the Lord by another change of body under the influence of time and space. By attainment of absolute knowledge, one can be in association with the Lord constantly, even in this present life, simply by hearing, chanting, thinking of and worshiping the Supreme Lord. One can see Him, one can feel His presence even in this present life simply by understanding the <span class="Italic">advaya-j&ntilde;&#257;na</span> Lord, or the Absolute Lord, through the process of devotional service, which begins with hearing about Him. Lord Caitanya says that simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord one can at once wash off the dust on the mirror of pure consciousness, and as soon as the dust is removed, one is at once freed from all material conditions. To become free from material conditions means to liberate the soul. As soon as one is, therefore, situated in absolute knowledge, his material conception of life is removed, or he emerges from a false conception of life. Thus the function of the pure soul is revived in spiritual realization. This practical realization of the living being is made possible due to his becoming free from the reaction of the three modes of material nature, namely goodness, passion and ignorance. By the grace of the Lord, a pure devotee is at once raised to the place of the Absolute, and there is no chance of the devotee's becoming materially entangled again in conditioned life. One is not able to feel the presence of the Lord in all circumstances until one is endowed with the required transcendental vision made possible by devotional service prescribed in the revealed scriptures. Arjuna had attained this stage long before on the Battlefield of Kuruk&#7779;etra, and when he apparently felt the absence of the Lord, he at once took shelter of the instructions of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> and thus again he was placed in his original position. This is the position of <span class="Italic">vi&#347;oka,</span> or the stage of being freed from all grief and anxieties.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Upon hearing of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's returning to His abode, and upon understanding the end of the Yadu dynasty's earthly manifestation, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira decided to go back home, back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira also turned his attention to the instructions of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> after hearing about the Lord's departure from the vision of earthly people. He began to deliberate on the Lord's way of appearance and departure. The mission of the Lord's appearance and disappearance in the mortal universe is completely dependent on His supreme will. He is not forced to appear or disappear by any superior energy, as the living beings appear and disappear, being forced by the laws of nature. Whenever the Lord likes, He can appear Himself from anywhere and everywhere without disturbing His appearance and disappearance in any other place. He is like the sun. The sun appears and disappears on its own accord at any place without disturbing its presence in other places. The sun appears in the morning in India without disappearing from the western hemisphere. The sun is present everywhere and anywhere all over the solar system, but it so appears that in a particular place the sun appears in the morning and also disappears at some fixed time in the evening. The time limitation even of the sun is of no concern, and so what to speak of the Supreme Lord who is the creator and controller of the sun. Therefore, in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is stated that anyone who factually understands the transcendental appearance and disappearance of the Lord by His inconceivable energy becomes liberated from the laws of birth and death and is placed in the eternal spiritual sky where the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets are. There such liberated persons can eternally live without the pangs of birth, death, old age and disease. In the spiritual sky the Lord and those who are eternally engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord are all eternally young because there is no old age and disease and there is no death. Because there is no death there is no birth. It is concluded, therefore, that simply by understanding the Lord's appearance and disappearance in truth, one can attain the perfectional stage of eternal life. Therefore, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira also began to consider going back to Godhead. The Lord appears on the earth or any other mortal planet along with His associates who live with Him eternally, and the members of the Yadu family who were engaged in supplementing the pastimes of the Lord are no other than His eternal associates, and so also Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira and his brothers and mother, etc. Since the appearance and disappearance of the Lord and His eternal associates are transcendental, one should not be bewildered by the external features of appearance and disappearance.</div>

<div class="Translation">Kunt&#299;, after overhearing Arjuna's telling of the end of the Yadu dynasty and disappearance of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, engaged in the devotional service of the transcendental Personality of Godhead with full attention and thus gained release from the course of material existence.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The setting of the sun does not mean the end of the sun. It means that the sun is out of our sight. Similarly, the end of the mission of the Lord on a particular planet or universe only means that He is out of our sight. The end of the Yadu dynasty also does not mean that it is annihilated. It disappears, along with the Lord, out of our sight. As Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira decided to prepare to go back to Godhead, so also Kunt&#299; decided, and thus she fully engaged herself in the transcendental devotional service of the Lord which guarantees one a passport for going back to Godhead after quitting this present material body. The beginning of devotional service to the Lord is the beginning of spiritualizing the present body, and thus an unalloyed devotee of the Lord loses all material contact in the present body. The abode of the Lord is not a myth, as is thought by the unbelievers or ignorant people, but one cannot reach there by any material means like a sputnik or space capsule. But one can certainly reach there after leaving this present body, and one must prepare himself to go back to Godhead by practicing devotional service. That guarantees a passport for going back to Godhead, and Kunt&#299; adopted it.</div>

<div class="Translation">The Supreme Unborn, Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, caused the members of the Yadu dynasty to relinquish their bodies, and thus He relieved the burden of the world. This action was like picking out a thorn with a thorn, though both are the same to the controller.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura suggests that the <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is</span> like &#346;aunaka and others who were hearing <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> from S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; at Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya were not happy to hear about the Yadu's dying in the madness of intoxication. To give them relief from this mental agony, S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; assured them that the Lord caused the members of the Yadu dynasty to relinquish their bodies by which they had to take away the burden of the world. The Lord and His eternal associates appeared on earth to help the administrative demigods in eradicating the burden of the world. He therefore called for some of the confidential demigods to appear in the Yadu family and serve Him in His great mission. After the mission was fulfilled, the demigods, by the will of the Lord, relinquished their corporeal bodies by fighting amongst themselves in the madness of intoxication. The demigods are accustomed to drinking the <span class="Italic">soma-rasa</span> beverage, and therefore the drinking of wine and intoxication are not unknown to them. Sometimes they were put into trouble for indulging in intoxication. Once the sons of Kuvera fell in the wrath of N&#257;rada for being intoxicated, but afterwards they regained their original forms by the grace of the Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. We shall find this story in the Tenth Canto. For the Supreme Lord, both the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> and the demigods are equal, but the demigods are obedient to the Lord, whereas the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> are not. Therefore, the example of picking out a thorn by another thorn is quite befitting. One thorn, which causes pinpricks on the leg of the Lord, is certainly disturbing to the Lord, and the other thorn, which takes out the disturbing elements, certainly gives service to the Lord. So although every living being is a part and parcel of the Lord, still one who is a pinprick to the Lord is called an <span class="Italic">asura,</span> and one who is a voluntary servitor of the Lord is called a <span class="Italic">devat&#257;,</span> or demigod. In the material world the <span class="Italic">devat&#257;s</span> and <span class="Italic">asuras</span> are always contending, and the <span class="Italic">devat&#257;s</span> are always saved from the hands of the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> by the Lord. Both of them are under the control of the Lord. The world is full of two kinds of living beings, and the Lord's mission is always to protect the <span class="Italic">devat&#257;s</span> and destroy the <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> whenever there is such a need in the world, and to do good to both of them.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">The Supreme Lord relinquished the body which He manifested to diminish the burden of the earth. Just like a magician, He relinquishes one body to accept different ones, like the fish incarnation and others.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Supreme Lord Personality of Godhead is neither impersonal nor formless, but His body is nondifferent from Him, and therefore He is known as the embodiment of eternity, knowledge and bliss. In the <span class="Italic">B&#7771;had-vai&#7779;&#7751;ava Tantra</span> it is clearly mentioned that anyone who considers the form of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a to be made of material energy must be ostracized by all means. And if by chance the face of such an infidel is seen, one must clean himself by jumping in the river with his clothing. The Lord is described as <span class="Italic">am&#7771;ta,</span> or deathless, because He has no material body. Under the circumstances, the Lord's dying or quitting His body is like the jugglery of a magician. The magician shows by his tricks that he is cut to pieces, burnt to ashes or made unconscious by hypnotic influences, but all are false shows only. Factually the magician himself is neither burnt to ashes nor cut to pieces, nor is he dead or unconscious at any stage of his magical demonstration. Similarly, the Lord has His eternal forms of unlimited variety, of which the fish incarnation, as was exhibited within this universe, is also one. Because there are innumerable universes, somewhere or other the fish incarnation must be manifesting His pastimes without cessation. In this verse, the particular word <span class="Italic">dhatte,</span> eternally accepted, (and not the word <span class="Italic">dhatv&#257;,</span> accepted for the occasion) is used. The idea is that the Lord does not create the fish incarnation; He eternally has such a form, and the appearance and disappearance of such an incarnation serves particular purposes. In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexcc71.html?g=2676">7.24</a>-25) the Lord says, "The impersonalists think that I have no form, that I am formless, but that at present I have accepted a form to serve a purpose, and now I am manifested. But such speculators are factually without sharp intelligence. Though they may be good scholars in the Vedic literatures, they are practically ignorant of My inconceivable energies and My eternal forms of personality. The reason is that I reserve the power of not being exposed to the nondevotees by My mystic curtain. The less intelligent fools are therefore unaware of My eternal form, which is never to be vanquished and is unborn." In the <span class="Italic">Padma Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> it is said that those who are envious and always angry at the Lord are unfit to know the actual and eternal form of the Lord. In the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> also it is said that the Lord appeared like a thunderbolt to those who were wrestlers. &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la, at the time of being killed by the Lord, could not see Him as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, being dazzled by the glare of the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti.</span> Therefore, the temporary manifestation of the Lord as a thunderbolt to the wrestlers appointed by Ka&#7745;sa, or the glaring appearance of the Lord before &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la, was relinquished by the Lord, but the Lord as a magician is eternally existent and is never vanquished in any circumstance. Such forms are temporarily shown to the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> only, and when such exhibitions are withdrawn, the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> think that the Lord is no more existent, just as the foolish audience thinks the magician to be burnt to ashes or cut to pieces. The conclusion is that the Lord has no material body, and therefore He is never to be killed or changed by His transcendental body.</div>

So he wisely prepared himself to leave home, and he dressed accordingly.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The present age is influenced by the specific qualities of Kali. Since the days of the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra, about five thousand years ago, the influence of the age of Kali began manifesting, and from authentic scriptures it is learned that the age of Kali is still to run on for 427,000 years. The symptoms of the Kali-yuga, as mentioned above, namely avarice, falsehood, diplomacy, cheating, nepotism, violence and all such things, are already in vogue, and no one can imagine what is going to happen gradually with further increase of the influence of Kali till the day of annihilation. We have already come to know that the influence of the age of Kali is meant for godless so-called civilized man; those who are under the protection of the Lord have nothing to fear from this horrible age. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira was a great devotee of the Lord, and there was no necessity of his being afraid of the age of Kali, but he preferred to retire from active household life and prepare himself to go back home, back to Godhead. The P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas are eternal companions of the Lord, and therefore they are more interested in the company of the Lord than anything else. Besides that, being an ideal king, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira wanted to retire just to set an example for others. As soon as there is some young fellow to look after the household affairs, one should at once retire from family life to uplift oneself to spiritual realization. One should not rot in the dark well of household life till one is dragged out by the will of Yamar&#257;ja. Modern politicians should take lessons from Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira about voluntary retirement from active life and should make room for the younger generation. Also retired old gentlemen should take lessons from him and leave home for spiritual realization before forcefully dragged away to meet death.</div>

The only reason is that the people of the world were happy because of the good administration of the Emperor. The happiness of the citizens was due to the ample production of natural produce such as grains, fruits, milk, herbs, valuable stones, minerals and everything that the people needed. They were even free from all bodily miseries, anxieties of mind, and disturbances caused by natural phenomena and other living beings. Because everyone was happy in all respects, there was no resentment, although there were sometimes battles between the state kings for political reasons and supremacy. Everyone was trained to attain the highest goal of life, and therefore the people were also enlightened enough not to quarrel over trivialities. The influence of the age of Kali gradually infiltrated the good qualities of both the kings and the citizens, and therefore a tense situation developed between the ruler and the ruled, but still even in this age of disparity between the ruler and the ruled, there can be spiritual emolument and God consciousness. That is a special prerogative.</div>

Everyone's life must be so arranged that the last stage of life, say at least the last fifteen to twenty years prior to death, can be absolutely devoted to the devotional service of the Lord to attain the highest perfection of life. It is really foolishness to engage oneself all the days of one's life in material enjoyment and fruitive activities, because as long as the mind remains absorbed in fruitive work for material enjoyment, there is no chance of getting out from conditioned life, or material bondage. No one should follow the suicidal policy of neglecting one's supreme task of attaining the highest perfection of life, namely going back home, back to Godhead.</div>

He became disinterested in his kingdom and family and thus became free from all material contamination, or material designation. People are generally attached to various kinds of designations-the designations of family, society, country, occupation, wealth, position and many others. As long as one is attached to such designations, he is considered materially impure. The so-called leaders of men in the modern age are attached by national consciousness, but they do not know that such false consciousness is also another designation of the materially conditioned soul; one has to relinquish such designations before one can become eligible to go back to Godhead. Foolish people adore such men who die in national consciousness, but here is an example of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, a royal king who prepared himself to leave this world without such national consciousness. And yet he is remembered even today because he was a great pious king, almost on the same level with the Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; R&#257;ma. And because people of the world were dominated by such pious kings, they were happy in all respects, and it was quite possible for such great emperors to rule the world.</div>

<div class="First">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, like his brother Arjuna, began to concentrate and gradually became freed from all material bondage. First he concentrated all the actions of the senses and amalgamated them into the mind, or in other words he turned his mind toward the transcendental service of the Lord. He prayed that since all material activities are performed by the mind in terms of actions and reactions of the material senses, and since he was going back to Godhead, the mind would wind up its material activities and be turned towards the transcendental service to the Lord. There was no longer a need for material activities. Actually the activities of the mind cannot be stopped, for they are the reflection of the eternal soul, but the quality of the activities can be changed from matter to the transcendental service of the Lord. The material color of the mind is changed when one washes it from contaminations of life-breathing and thereby frees it from the contamination of repeated births and deaths and situates it in pure spiritual life. All is manifested by the temporary embodiment of the material body, which is a production of the mind at the time of death, and if the mind is purified by practice of transcendental loving service to the Lord and is constantly engaged in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord, there is no more chance of the mind's producing another material body after death. It will be freed from absorption in material contamination. The pure soul will be able to return home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">All that is manifested in the material world is the product of the <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva-avyakta,</span> and things that are visible in our material vision are nothing but combinations and permutations of such variegated material products. But the living entity is different from such material products. It is due to the living entity's forgetfulness of his eternal nature as eternal servitor of the Lord, and his false conception of being a so-called lord of the material nature, that he is obliged to enter into the existence of false sense enjoyment. Thus a concomitant generation of material energies is the principal cause of the mind's being materially affected. Thus the gross body of five elements is produced. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira reversed the action and merged the five elements of the body in the three modes of material nature. The qualitative distinction of the body as being good, bad or mediocre is extinguished, and again the qualitative manifestations become merged in the material energy, which is produced from a false sense of the pure living being. When one is thus inclined to become an associate of the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, in one of the innumerable planets of the spiritual sky, especially in Goloka V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, one has to think always that he is different from the material energy; he has nothing to do with it, and he has to realize himself as pure spirit, Brahman, qualitatively equal with the Supreme Brahman (Parame&#347;vara). Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, after distributing his kingdom to Par&#299;k&#7779;it and Vajra, did not think himself Emperor of the world or head of the Kuru dynasty. This sense of freedom from material relations, as well as freedom from the material encagement of the gross and subtle encirclement, makes one free to act as the servitor of the Lord, even though one is in the material world. This stage is called the <span class="Italic">j&#299;vanmukta</span> stage, or the liberated stage, even in the material world. That is the process of ending material existence. One must not only think that he is Brahman, but must act like Brahman. One who only thinks himself Brahman is an impersonalist. And one who acts like Brahman is the pure devotee.</div>

The training and education was so imparted, and thus a respectable person like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira had to leave all family connection for self-realization and going back to Godhead. No king or respectable gentleman would continue family life till the end, because that was considered suicidal and against the interest of the perfection of human life. In order to be free from all family encumbrances and devote oneself cent percent in the devotional service of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, this system is always recommended for everyone because it is the path of authority. The Lord instructs in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index5522.html?g=5961">18.62</a>) that one must become a devotee of the Lord at least at the last stage of one's life.

It is quite reasonable, therefore, that they concentrated their minds upon the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. According to &#346;r&#299; Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299;, <span class="Italic">dharma, artha, k&#257;ma</span> and <span class="Italic">mok&#7779;a</span> principles are accepted by persons who are not free from the results of impious action. Such persons affected with the contaminations of the above four principles cannot at once accept the lotus feet of the Lord in the spiritual sky. The Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha world is situated far beyond the material sky. The material sky is under the management of Durg&#257; Dev&#299;, or the material energy of the Lord, but the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha world is managed by the personal energy of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation">Vidura, while on pilgrimage, left his body at Prabh&#257;sa. Because he was absorbed in thought of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, he was received by the denizens of Pit&#7771;loka planet, where he returned to his original post.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The difference between the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas and Vidura is that the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas are eternal associates of the Lord, the Personality of Godhead, whereas Vidura is one of the administrative demigods in charge of the Pit&#7771;loka planet and is known as Yamar&#257;ja. Men are afraid of Yamar&#257;ja because it is he only who awards punishment to the miscreants of the material world, but those who are devotees of the Lord have nothing to fear from him. To the devotees he is a cordial friend, but to the nondevotees he is fear personified. As we have already discussed, it is understood that Yamar&#257;ja was cursed by Ma&#7751;&#7693;&#363;ka Muni to be degraded as a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra,</span> and therefore Vidura was an incarnation of Yamar&#257;ja. As an eternal servitor of the Lord, he displayed his devotional activities very ardently and lived a life of a pious man, so much so that a materialistic man like Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra also got salvation by his instruction. So by his pious activities in the devotional service of the Lord he was able to always remember the lotus feet of the Lord, and thus he became washed of all contamination of a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra-</span>born life. At the end he was again received by the denizens of Pit&#7771;loka and posted in his original position. The demigods are also associates of the Lord without personal touch, whereas the direct associates of the Lord are in constant personal touch with Him. The Lord and His personal associates incarnate in many universes without cessation. The Lord remembers them all, whereas the associates forget due to their being very minute parts and parcels of the Lord; they are apt to forget such incidents due to being infinitesimal.

<div class="First">When flying an airplane, one cannot take care of other planes. Everyone has to take care of his own plane, and if there is any danger, no other plane can help another in that condition. Similarly, at the end of life, when one has to go back home, back to Godhead, everyone has to take care of himself without help rendered by another. The help is, however, offered on the ground before flying in space. Similarly, the spiritual master, the father, the mother, the relatives, the husband and others can all render help during one's lifetime, but while crossing the sea one has to take care of himself and utilize the instructions formerly received. Draupad&#299; had five husbands, and no one asked Draupad&#299; to come; Draupad&#299; had to take care of herself without waiting for her great husbands. And because she was already trained, she at once took to concentration upon the lotus feet of Lord V&#257;sudeva, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Personality of Godhead.

Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it developed all those qualities, being a great devotee of the Lord. The real qualification is to become a devotee of the Lord, and gradually all the good qualities worthy of possession develop. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata,</span> or a first-class devotee, who was not only well versed in the science of devotion but also able to convert others to become devotees by his transcendental instructions. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was, therefore, a devotee of the first order, and thus he used to consult great sages and learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> who could advise him by the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> how to execute the state administration. Such great kings were more responsible than modern elected executive heads because they obliged the great authorities by following their instructions left in Vedic literatures. There was no need for impractical fools to enact daily a new legislative bill and to conveniently alter it again and again to serve some purpose. The rules and regulations were already set forth by great sages like Manu, Y&#257;j&ntilde;avalkya, Par&#257;&#347;ara and other liberated sages, and the enactments were all suitable for all ages in all places. Therefore the rules and regulations were standard and without flaw or defect. Kings like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it had their council of advisers, and all the members of that council were either great sages or <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> of the first order. They did not accept any salary, nor had they any necessity for such salaries. <span class="Italic">The state would get the best advice without expenditure.</span> They were themselves <span class="Italic">samadar&#347;&#299;,</span> equal to everyone, both man and animal. They would not advise the king to give protection to man and instruct him to kill the poor animals. Such council members were not fools or representatives to compose a fool's paradise. They were all self-realized souls, and they knew perfectly well how all living beings in the state would be happy, both in this life and in the next. They were not concerned with the hedonistic philosophy of eat, drink, be merry and enjoy. They were philosophers in the real sense, and they knew well what is the mission of human life. Under all these obligations, the advisory council of the king would give correct directions, and the king or executive head, being himself a qualified devotee of the Lord, would scrutinizingly follow them for the welfare of the state. The state in the days of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira or Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was a welfare state in the real sense of the term because no one was unhappy in that state, be he man or animal. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was an ideal king for a welfare state of the world.</div>

He invaded Tak&#7779;al&#257; (Ajanta), and he decided to avenge the unlawful curse upon his great father, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it. He performed a great sacrifice called Sarpa-yaj&ntilde;a, to kill the race of serpents, including the <span class="Italic">tak&#7779;aka,</span> which had bitten his father to death. On request from many influential demigods and sages, he had to change his decision to kill the race of snakes, but despite stopping the sacrifice, he satisfied everyone concerned in the sacrifice by rewarding them properly. In the ceremony, Mah&#257;muni Vy&#257;sadeva also was present, and he personally narrated the history of the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra before the King. Later on by the order of Vy&#257;sadeva, his disciple Vai&#347;amp&#257;yana narrated before the King the subject matter of <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata.</span> He was much affected by his great father's untimely death and was very anxious to see him again, and he expressed his desire before the great sage Vy&#257;sadeva. Vy&#257;sadeva also fulfilled his desire. His father was present before him, and he worshiped both his father and Vy&#257;sadeva with great respect and pomp. Being fully satisfied, he most munificently gave charities to the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> present at the sacrifice.</div>

<div class="Translation">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, after having selected K&#7771;p&#257;c&#257;rya for guidance as his spiritual master, performed three horse sacrifices on the banks of the Ganges. These were executed with sufficient rewards for the attendants. And at these sacrifices, even the common man could see demigods.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">It appears from this verse that interplanetary travel by the denizens of higher planets is easy. In many statements in <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> we have observed that the demigods from heaven used to visit this earth to attend sacrifices performed by influential kings and emperors. Herein also we find that during the time of the horse sacrifice ceremony of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, the demigods from other planets were visible even to the common man, due to the sacrificial ceremony. The demigods are not generally visible to common men, as the Lord is not visible. But as the Lord, by His causeless mercy, descends to be visible to the common man, similarly the demigods also become visible to the common man by their own grace. Although celestial beings are not visible to the naked eyes of the inhabitants of this earth, it was due to the influence of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it that the demigods also agreed to be visible. The kings used to spend lavishly during such sacrifices, as a cloud distributes rains. A cloud is nothing but another form of water, or, in other words, the waters of the earth transform into clouds. Similarly, the charity made by the kings in such sacrifices are but another form of the taxes collected from the citizens. But, as the rains fall down very lavishly and appear to be more than necessary, the charity made by such kings also seems to be more than what the citizen needs. Satisfied citizens will never organize agitation against the king, and thus there was no need in changing the monarchial state.</div>
<div class="Purport">Even for a king like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it there was need of a spiritual master for guidance. Without such guidance one cannot make progress in spiritual life. The spiritual master must be bona fide, and one who wants to have self-realization must approach and take shelter of a bona fide spiritual master to achieve real success.</div>

<div class="Translation">Once, when Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was on his way to conquer the world, he saw the master of Kali-yuga, who was lower than a &#347;&#363;dra, disguised as a king and hurting the legs of a cow and bull. The King at once caught hold of him to deal sufficient punishment.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The purpose of a king's going out to conquer the world is not for self-aggrandizement. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it went out to conquer the world after his ascendance to the throne, but this was not for the purpose of aggression on other states. He was the Emperor of the world, and all small states were already under his regime. His purpose in going out was to see how things were going on in terms of the godly state. The king, being the representative of the Lord, has to execute the will of the Lord duly. There is no question of self-aggrandizement. Thus as soon as Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it saw that a lower-class man in the dress of a king was hurting the legs of a cow and a bull, at once he arrested and punished him. The king cannot tolerate insults to the most important animal, the cow, nor can he tolerate disrespect for the most important man, the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> Human civilization means to advance the cause of brahminical culture, and to maintain it, cow protection is essential. There is a miracle in milk, for it contains all the necessary vitamins to sustain human physiological conditions for higher achievements. Brahminical culture can advance only when man is educated to develop the quality of goodness, and for this there is a prime necessity of food prepared with milk, fruits and grains. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was astonished to see that a black <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra,</span> dressed like a ruler, was mistreating a cow, the most important animal in human society.</div>
<div class="Purport">The age of Kali means mismanagement and quarrel. And the root cause of all mismanagement and quarrel is that worthless men with the modes of lower-class men, who have no higher ambition in life, come to the helm of the state management. Such men at the post of a king are sure to first hurt the cow and the brahminical culture, thereby pushing all society towards hell. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, trained as he was, got the scent of this root cause of all quarrel in the world. Thus he wanted to stop it in the very beginning.</div>

Anyway, although hearing about a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;draka</span> who was a cheat and insulter of a cow was not very interesting to the great <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is,</span> they nevertheless wanted to hear about it to see if the event had any connection with Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. They were simply interested in the topics of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, for anything that is dovetailed with the narration of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is worth hearing. There are many topics in the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> about sociology, politics, economics, cultural affairs, etc., but all of them are in relation with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and therefore all of them are worth hearing. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the purifying ingredient in all matters, regardless of what they are. In the mundane world, everything is impure due to its being a product of the three mundane qualities.

There is no need to eradicate politics, economics, sociology, etc., which are mundane to the mundaners. To a pure devotee, who is actually related with the Lord, such mundane things are transcendental if dovetailed with the Lord or with His pure devotees. We have heard and talked about the activities of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, and we now are dealing with the topics of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, but because all these topics are related to the Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, they are all transcendental, and pure devotees have great interest in hearing them. We have already discussed this matter in connection with the prayers of Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva.</div>
<div class="Purport">Our duration of life is not very long, and there is no certainty of when we shall be ordered to leave everything for the next stage. Thus it is our duty to see that not a moment of our life is wasted in topics which are not related with Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Any topic, however pleasant, is not worth hearing if it is devoid of its relation to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>
<div class="Purport">The spiritual planet, Goloka V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, the eternal abode of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, is shaped like the whorl of a lotus flower. Even when the Lord descends to any one of the mundane planets, He does so by manifesting His own abode as it is. Thus His feet remain always on the same big whorl of the lotus flower. His feet are also as beautiful as the lotus flower. Therefore it is said that Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a has lotus feet.</div>
<div class="Purport">A living being is eternal by constitution. He is, so to speak, in the whirlpool of birth and death due to his contact with material energy. Freed from such material energy, a living entity is liberated and is eligible to return home, back to Godhead.

The scientist, who puts forward the theory of stopping death by advancement of scientific knowledge, becomes himself a victim of death when he is called by Yamar&#257;ja. What to speak of stopping death, no one can enhance the short period of life even by a fraction of a moment. The only hope of suspending the cruel slaughtering process of Yamar&#257;ja is to call him to hear and chant the holy name of the Lord. Yamar&#257;ja is a great devotee of the Lord, and he likes to be invited to <span class="Italic">k&#299;rtanas</span> and sacrifices by the pure devotees, who are constantly engaged in the devotional service of the Lord.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The less intelligent do not know the real value of the human form of life. The human form is a special gift of material nature in the course of her enforcing stringent laws of miseries upon the living being. It is a chance to achieve the highest boon of life, namely to get out of the entanglement of repeated birth and death. The intelligent take care of this important gift by strenuously endeavoring to get out of the entanglement. But the less intelligent are lazy and unable to evaluate the gift of the human body to achieve liberation from the material bondage; they become more interested in so-called economic development and work very hard throughout life simply for the sense enjoyment of the temporary body. Sense enjoyment is also allowed to the lower animals by the law of nature, and thus a human being is also destined to a certain amount of sense enjoyment according to his past or present life. But one should definitely try to understand that sense enjoyment is not the ultimate goal of human life. Herein it is said that during the daytime one works "for nothing" because the aim is nothing but sense enjoyment. We can particularly observe how the human being is engaged for nothing in the great cities and industrial towns. There are so many things manufactured by human energy, but they are all meant for sense enjoyment, and not for getting out of material bondage. And after working hard during the daytime, a tired man either sleeps or engages in sex habits at night. That is the program of materialistic civilized life for the less intelligent. Therefore they are designated herein as lazy, unfortunate and short-lived.</div>

<div class="Translation">S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; said: While Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was residing in the capital of the Kuru empire, the symptoms of the age of Kali began to infiltrate within the jurisdiction of his state. When he learned about this, he did not think the matter very palatable. This did, however, give him a chance to fight. He took up his bow and arrows and prepared himself for military activities.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The state administration of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was so perfect that he was sitting in his capital peacefully. But he got the news that the symptoms of the age of Kali had already infiltrated into the jurisdiction of his state, and he did not like this news. What are the symptoms of the age of Kali? They are (1) illicit connection with women, (2) indulgence in meat-eating, (3) intoxication and (4) taking pleasure in gambling. The age of Kali literally means the age of quarrel, and the abovementioned four symptoms in human society are the root causes for all kinds of quarrel. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it heard that some of the people of the state had already taken to those symptoms, and he wanted to take immediate steps against such causes of unrest. This means that at least up to the regime of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, such symptoms of public life were practically unknown, and as soon as they were slightly detected, he wanted to root them out. The news was not palatable for him, but in a way it was, because Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it got a chance to fight. There was no need to fight with small states because everyone was peacefully under his subordination, but the Kali-yuga miscreants gave his fighting spirit a chance for exhibition. A perfect <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> king is always jubilant as soon as he gets a chance to fight, just as a sportsman is eager when there is a chance for a sporting match. It is no argument that in the age of Kali such symptoms are predestined. If so, then why was there preparation for fighting out such symptoms? Such arguments are offered by lazy and unfortunate men. In the rainy season, rain is predestined, and yet people take precautions to protect themselves. Similarly, in the age of Kali the symptoms as above mentioned are sure to infiltrate into social life, but it is the duty of the state to save the citizens from the association of the agents of the age of Kali. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it wanted to punish the miscreants indulging in the symptoms of Kali, and thus save the innocent citizens who were pure in habit by culture of religion. It is the duty of the king to give such protection, and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was perfectly right when he prepared himself to fight.</div>

<div class="Purport">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira also conquered this island, and thus the province was included within the jurisdiction of his empire.

<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Ketum&#257;la:</span> This earth planet is divided into seven parts, and according to others it is divided into nine parts.

Jamb&#363;dv&#299;pa is only one of such countless islands in this airy ocean of space. A description of Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a is given in the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span> (<span class="Italic">Bh&#299;&#7779;ma Parva,</span> Chapters 9-10).</div>

When Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira performed a horse sacrifice,  the inhabitants of these countries were also present to take part in the festival, and they paid tributes to the Emperor. This part of the world is called Kimpuru&#7779;a-var&#7779;a, or sometimes the Himalayan provinces (Himavat&#299;). It is said that &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was born in these Himalayan provinces, and he came to Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a after crossing the Himalayan countries.</div>
<div class="Purport">In other words, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it conquered all the world, namely all the continents adjoining all the seas and oceans in all directions, namely the eastern, western, northern and southern parts of the world.</div>

<div class="Translation">Wherever the King visited, he continuously heard the glories of his great forefathers, who were all devotees of the Lord, and also of the glorious acts of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.

People also mentioned the great affection between the descendants of V&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;i and P&#7771;th&#257; due to the latter's great devotion to Lord Ke&#347;ava.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Kings and great personalities of the state are presented with welcome addresses. This is a system from time immemorial, and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, since he was one of the well-known emperors of the world, was also presented with addresses of welcome in all parts of the world as he visited those places. The subject matter of those welcome addresses was K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a means K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and His eternal devotees, as the king means the king and his confidential associates.</div>
<div class="Purport">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and His unalloyed devotees cannot be separated, and therefore glorifying the devotee means glorifying the Lord and vice versa. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it would not have been glad to hear about the glories of his forefathers like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira and Arjuna had they not been connected with the acts of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The Lord descends specifically to deliver His devotees (<span class="Italic">paritr&#257;&#7751;&#257;ya s&#257;dh&#363;n&#257;m </I>[</I>Bg. </span><a href="indexb53f.html?g=1496">4.8</a>]). The devotees are glorified by the presence of the Lord because they cannot live for a moment without the presence of the Lord and His different energies. The Lord is present for the devotee by His acts and glories, and therefore Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it felt the presence of the Lord when He was glorified by His acts, especially when he was saved by the Lord in the womb of his mother. The devotees of the Lord are never in danger, but in the material world which is full of dangers at every step, the devotees are apparently placed into dangerous positions, and when they are saved by the Lord, the Lord is glorified. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a would not have been glorified as the speaker of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> had His devotees like the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas not been entangled in the Battlefield of Kuruk&#7779;etra. All such acts of the Lord were mentioned in the addresses of welcome, and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, in full satisfaction, rewarded those who presented such addresses. The difference between the presentation of welcome addresses today and in those days is that formerly the welcome addresses were presented to a person like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it. The welcome addresses were full of facts and figures, and those who presented such addresses were sufficiently rewarded, whereas in the present days the welcome addresses are presented not always with factual statements but to please the postholder, and often they are full of flattering lies. And rarely are those who present such welcome addresses rewarded by the poor receiver.</div>

Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, as a pure devotee of the Lord, could appreciate the Lord's transcendental reciprocation of the feelings of His devotees, and thus he himself also was overwhelmed with the dealings of the Lord. Simply by appreciating the dealings of the Lord with His pure devotees, one can attain salvation. The Lord's dealings with His devotees appear to be ordinary human dealings, but one who knows them in truth becomes at once eligible to go back home, back to Godhead. The P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas were so malleable to the will of the Lord that they could sacrifice any amount of energy for the service of the Lord, and by such unalloyed determination they could secure the Lord's mercy in any shape they desired.</div>

<div class="First">The bull is the emblem of the moral principle, and the cow is the representative of the earth. When the bull and the cow are in a joyful mood, it is to be understood that the people of the world are also in a joyful mood. The reason is that the bull helps production of grains in the agricultural field, and the cow delivers milk, the miracle of aggregate food values. The human society, therefore, maintains these two important animals very carefully so that they can wander everywhere in cheerfulness. But at the present moment in this age of Kali both the bull and the cow are now being slaughtered and eaten up as foodstuff by a class of men who do not know the brahminical culture. The bull and the cow can be protected for the good of all human society simply by the spreading of brahminical culture as the topmost perfection of all cultural affairs. By advancement of such culture, the morale of society is properly maintained, and so peace and prosperity are also attained without extraneous effort. When brahminical culture deteriorates, the cow and bull are mistreated, and the resultant actions are prominent by the following symptoms.</div>

The particular symptom of the age of Kali is that no family is now blessed to live together. To earn a livelihood, the father lives at a place far away from the son, or the wife lives far away from the husband and so on. There are sufferings from internal diseases, separation from those near and dear, and anxieties for maintaining the status quo.

<div class="Translation">I have lost my three legs and am now standing on one only. Are you lamenting for my state of existence? Or are you in great anxiety because henceforward the unlawful meat-eaters will exploit you? Or are you in a sorry plight because the demigods are now bereft of their share of sacrificial offerings because no sacrifices are being performed at present? Or are you grieving for living beings because of their sufferings due to famine and drought?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">With the progress of the age of Kali, four things particularly, namely the duration of life, mercy, the power of recollection, and moral or religious principles will gradually diminish. Since Dharma, or the principles of religion, would be lost in the proportion of three out of four, the symbolic bull was standing on one leg only. When three fourths of the population of the whole world become irreligious, the situation is converted into hell for the animals. In the age of Kali, godless civilizations will create so many so-called religious societies in which the Personality of Godhead will be directly or indirectly defied. And thus faithless societies of men will make the world uninhabitable for the saner section of people. There are gradations of human beings in terms of proportionate faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The first-class faithful men are the Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas and the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> then the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas,</span> then the <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas,</span> then the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras,</span> then the <span class="Italic">mlecchas,</span> the <span class="Italic">yavanas</span> and at last the <span class="Italic">ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;las.</span> The degradation of the human instinct begins from the <span class="Italic">mlecchas,</span> and the <span class="Italic">ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la</span> state of life is the last word in human degradation. All the above terms mentioned in the Vedic literatures are never meant for any particular community or birth. They are different qualifications of human beings in general. There is no question of birthright or community. One can acquire the respective qualifications by one's own efforts, and thus the son of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava can become a <span class="Italic">mleccha,</span> or the son of a <span class="Italic">ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la</span> can become more than a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> all in terms of their association and intimate relation with the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="Purport"><JD:"Destination-252">The meat-eaters are generally called <span class="Italic">mlecchas.</span> But all meat-eaters are not <span class="Italic">mlecchas.</span> Those who accept meat in terms of scriptural injunctions are not <span class="Italic">mlecchas,</span> but those who accept meat without restriction are called <span class="Italic">mlecchas.</span> Beef is forbidden in the scriptures, and the bulls and cows are offered special protection by followers of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> But in this age of Kali, people will exploit the body of the bull and the cow as they like, and thus they will invite sufferings of various types.</div>
<div class="Purport">The people of this age will not perform any sacrifice. The <span class="Italic">mleccha</span> population will care very little for performances of sacrifices, although performance of sacrifice is essential for persons who are materially engaged in sense enjoyment. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> performance of sacrifices is strongly recommended (Bg. <a href="index3c8e.html?g=1158">3.14</a>-16).</div>
<div class="Purport">The living beings are created by the creator Brahm&#257;, and just to maintain the created living being progressively towards the path back to Godhead, the system of performing sacrifice is also created by him. The system is that living beings live on the produce of grains and vegetables, and by eating such foodstuff they get vital power of the body in the shape of blood and semina, and from blood and semina one living being is able to create other living beings. But the production of grains, grass, etc. becomes possible by rain, and this rain is made to shower properly by performance of recommended sacrifices. Such sacrifices are directed by the rites of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> namely <span class="Italic">S&#257;ma, Yajur, &#7770;g</span> and <span class="Italic">Atharva.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Manu-sm&#7771;ti</span> it is recommended that by offerings of sacrifice on the altar of the fire, the sun-god is pleased. When the sun-god is pleased, he properly collects water from the sea, and thus sufficient clouds collect on the horizon and rains fall. After sufficient rains fall, there is sufficient production of grains for men and all animals, and thus there is energy in the living being for progressive activity. The <span class="Italic">mlecchas,</span> however, make plans to install slaughterhouses for killing bulls and cows along with other animals, thinking that they will prosper by increasing the number of factories and live on animal food without caring for performance of sacrifices and production of grains. But they must know that even for the animals they must produce grass and vegetables, otherwise the animals cannot live. And to produce grass for the animals, they require sufficient rains. Therefore they have to depend ultimately on the mercy of the demigods like the sun-god, Indra and Candra, and such demigods must be satisfied by performances of sacrifice.</div>
<div class="Purport">This material world is a sort of prison house, as we have several times mentioned. The demigods are the servants of the Lord who see to the proper upkeep of the prison house. These demigods want to see that the rebel living beings, who want to survive faithlessly, are gradually turned towards the supreme power of the Lord. Therefore, the system of offering sacrifice is recommended in the scriptures.</div>
<div class="Purport">The materialistic men want to work hard and enjoy fruitive results for sense enjoyment. Thus they are committing many types of sins at every step of life. Those, however, who are consciously engaged in the devotional service of the Lord are transcendental to all varieties of sin and virtue. Their activities are free from the contamination of the three modes of material nature. For the devotees there is no need for performance of prescribed sacrifices because the very life of the devotee is a symbol of sacrifice. But persons who are engaged in fruitive activities for sense enjoyment must perform the prescribed sacrifices because that is the only means to get free from the reaction of all sins committed by fruitive workers. Sacrifice is the means for counteracting such accumulated sins. The demigods are pleased when such sacrifices are performed, just as prison officers are satisfied when the prisoners are turned into obedient subjects. Lord Caitanya, however, has recommended only one <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a,</span> or sacrifice, called the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana-yaj&ntilde;a,</span> the chanting of Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, in which everyone can take part. Thus both devotees and fruitive workers can derive equal benefit from the performances of <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana-yaj&ntilde;a.</span></div>

<div class="Translation">The so-called administrators are now bewildered by the influence of this age of Kali, and thus they have put all state affairs into disorder. Are you now lamenting this disorder? Now the general populace does not follow the rules and regulations for eating, sleeping, drinking, mating, etc., and they are inclined to perform such anywhere and everywhere. Are you unhappy because of this?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">There are some necessities of life on a par with those of the lower animals, and they are eating, sleeping, fearing and mating. These bodily demands are for both the human beings and the animals. But the human being has to fulfill such desires not like animals, but like a human being. A dog can mate with a bitch before the public eyes without hesitation, but if a human being does so the act will be considered a public nuisance, and the person will be criminally prosecuted. Therefore for the human being there are some rules and regulations, even for fulfilling common demands. The human society avoids such rules and regulations when it is bewildered by the influence of the age of Kali. In this age, people are indulging in such necessities of life without following the rules and regulations, and this deterioration of social and moral rules is certainly lamentable because of the harmful effects of such beastly behavior. In this age, the fathers and the guardians are not happy with the behavior of their wards. They should know that so many innocent children are victims of bad association awarded by the influence of this age of Kali. We know from <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> that Aj&#257;mila, an innocent son of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> was walking down a road and saw a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> pair sexually embracing. This attracted the boy, and later on the boy became a victim of all debaucheries. From a pure <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> he fell down to the position of a wretched urchin, and it was all due to bad association. There was but one victim like Aj&#257;mila in those days, but in this age of Kali the poor innocent students are daily victims of cinemas which attract men only for sex indulgence. The so-called administrators are all untrained in the affairs of a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya.</span> The <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> are meant for administration, as the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are meant for knowledge and guidance. The word <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atra-bandhu</span> refers to the so-called administrators or persons promoted to the post of the administrator without proper training by culture and tradition. Nowadays they are promoted to such exalted posts by the votes of the people who are themselves fallen in the rules and regulations of life. How can such people select a proper man when they are themselves fallen in the standard of life? Therefore, by the influence of the age of Kali, everywhere, politically, socially or religiously, everything is topsy-turvy, and therefore for the sane man it is all regrettable.</div>

<div class="First">The principles of religion are laid down by the Lord Himself, and the executor of such laws is Dharmar&#257;ja, or Yamar&#257;ja. Such principles work fully in the age of Satya-yuga; in the Tret&#257;-yuga they are reduced by a fraction of one fourth; in the Dv&#257;para-yuga they are reduced to one half, and in the Kali-yuga they are reduced to one fourth, gradually diminishing to the zero point, and then devastation takes place. Happiness in the world depends proportionately on the maintenance of the religious principles, individually or collectively. The best part of valor is to maintain the principles despite all kinds of odds. Thus one can be happy during the span of life and ultimately return to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation">In Him reside (1) truthfulness, (2) cleanliness, (3) intolerance of another's unhappiness, (4) the power to control anger, (5) self-satisfaction, (6) straightforwardness, (7) steadiness of mind, (8) control of the sense organs, (9) responsibility, (10) equality, (11) tolerance, (12) equanimity, (13) faithfulness, (14) knowledge, (15) absence of sense enjoyment, (16) leadership, (17) chivalry, (18) influence, (19) the power to make everything possible, (20) the discharge of proper duty, (21) complete independence, (22) dexterity, (23) fullness of all beauty, (24) serenity, (25) kindheartedness, (26) ingenuity, (27) gentility, (28) magnanimity, (29) determination, (30) perfection in all knowledge, (31) proper execution, (32) possession of all objects of enjoyment, (33) joyfulness, (34) immovability, (35) fidelity, (36) fame, (37) worship, (38) pridelessness, (39) being (as the Personality of Godhead), (40) eternity, and many other transcendental qualities which are eternally present and never to be separated from Him. That Personality of Godhead, the reservoir of all goodness and beauty, Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, has now closed His transcendental pastimes on the face of the earth. In His absence the age of Kali has spread its influence everywhere, so I am sorry to see this condition of existence.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Even if it were possible to count the atoms after smashing the earth into powder, still it would not be possible to estimate the unfathomable transcendental qualities of the Lord. It is said that Lord Anantadeva has tried to expound the transcendental qualities of the Supreme Lord with His numberless tongues, and that for numberless years together it has been impossible to estimate the qualities of the Lord. The above statement of the qualities of the Lord is just to estimate His qualities as far as a human being is able to see Him. But even if it is so, the above qualities can be divided into many subheadings. According to &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;, the third quality, intolerance of another's unhappiness, can be subdivided into (1) protection of the surrendered souls and (2) well wishes for the devotees. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the Lord states that He wants every soul to surrender unto Him only, and He assures everyone that if one does so He will give protection from the reactions of all sins. Unsurrendered souls are not devotees of the Lord, and thus there is no particular protection for everyone in general. For the devotees He has all good wishes, and for those who are actually engaged in loving transcendental service of the Lord, He gives particular attention. He gives direction to such pure devotees to help them discharge their responsibilities on the path back to Godhead. By equality (10), the Lord is equally kind to everyone, as the sun is equal in distributing its rays over everyone. Yet there are many who are unable to take advantage of the sun's rays. Similarly, the Lord says that surrendering unto Him is the guarantee for all protection from Him, but unfortunate persons are unable to accept this proposition, and therefore they suffer from all material miseries. So even though the Lord is equally well-wishing to everyone, the unfortunate living being, due to bad association only, is unable to accept His instructions <span class="Italic"></I>in toto,</span></I> and for this the Lord is never to be blamed. He is called the well-wisher for the devotees only. He appears to be partial to His devotees, but factually the matter rests on the living being to accept or reject equal treatment by the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purport">The Lord never deviates from His word of honor. When He gives assurance for protection, the promise is executed in all circumstances. It is the duty of the pure devotee to be fixed in the discharge of the duty entrusted to him by the Lord or the Lord's bona fide representative, the spiritual master. The rest is carried on by the Lord without a break.</div>
<div class="Purport">The responsibility of the Lord is also unique. The Lord has no responsibility because all His work is done by His different appointed energies. But still He accepts voluntary responsibilities in displaying different roles in His transcendental pastimes. As a boy, He was playing the part of a cowboy. As the son of Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, He discharged responsibility perfectly. Similarly, when He was playing the part of a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> as the son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Vasudeva, He displayed all the skill of a martially spirited <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya.</span> In almost all cases, the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> king has to secure a wife by fighting or kidnapping. This sort of behavior for a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> is praiseworthy in the sense that a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> must show his power of chivalry to his would-be wife so that the daughter of a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> can see the valor of her would-be husband. Even the Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; R&#257;ma displayed such a spirit of chivalry during His marriage. He broke the strongest bow, called Haradhanur, and achieved the hand of S&#299;t&#257;dev&#299;, the mother of all opulence. The <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> spirit is displayed during marriage festivals, and there is nothing wrong in such fighting. Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a discharged such responsibility fully because although He had more than sixteen thousand wives, in each and every case He fought like a chivalrous <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> and thus secured a wife. To fight sixteen thousand times to secure sixteen thousand wives is certainly possible only for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, He displayed full responsibility in every action of His different transcendental pastimes.</div>
<div class="Purport">The fourteenth quality, knowledge, can be further extended into five subheadings, namely (1) intelligence, (2) gratefulness, (3) power of understanding the circumstantial environments of place, object and time, (4) perfect knowledge of everything, and (5) knowledge of the self. Only fools are ungrateful to their benefactors. The Lord, however, does not require benefit from anyone besides Himself because He is full in Himself; still He feels benefited by the unalloyed services of His devotees. The Lord feels grateful to His devotees for such unsophisticated, unconditional service and tries to reciprocate it by rendering service, although the devotee also has no such desire in his heart. The transcendental service of the Lord is itself a transcendental benefit for the devotee, and therefore the devotee has nothing to expect from the Lord. On the assertion of the Vedic aphorism <span class="Italic">sarva&#7745; khalv ida&#7745; brahma,</span> we can understand that the Lord, by the omnipresent rays of His effulgence, called <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti,</span> is all-pervading inside or outside of everything, like the omnipresent material sky, and thus He is also omniscient.</div>
<div class="Purport">As far as the beauty of the Lord is concerned, He has some special features that distinguish Him from all other living beings, and over and above that He has some special attractive beautiful features by which He attracts the mind of even R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;&#7751;&#299;, the supermost beautiful creation of the Lord. He is known, therefore, as Madana-mohana, or one who attracts the mind of even Cupid. &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; Prabhu has scrutinizingly analyzed other transcendental qualities of the Lord and affirms that Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the Absolute Supreme Personality of Godhead (Parabrahman). He is omnipotent by His inconceivable energies, and therefore He is the Yoge&#347;vara, or the supreme master of all mystic powers. Being the Yoge&#347;vara, His eternal form is spiritual, a combination of eternity, bliss and knowledge. The nondevotee class cannot understand the dynamic nature of His knowledge because they are satisfied to reach up to His eternal form of knowledge. All great souls aspire to be equal in knowledge with Him. This means that all other knowledge is ever insufficient, flexible and measurable, whereas the knowledge of the Lord is ever fixed and unfathomable. &#346;r&#299;la S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; affirms in the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> that although He was observed by the citizens of Dv&#257;rak&#257; every day, they were ever increasingly anxious to see Him again and again. The living beings can appreciate the qualities of the Lord as the ultimate goal, but they cannot attain the status quo of such equality. This material world is a product of the <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva,</span> which is a state of the Lord's dreaming condition in His <span class="Italic">yoga-nidr&#257;</span> mystic slumber in the Causal Ocean, and yet the whole creation appears to be a factual presentation of His creation. This means that the Lord's dreaming conditions are also factual manifestations. He can therefore bring everything under His transcendental control, and thus whenever and wherever He does appear, He does so in His fullness.</div>
<div class="Purport">The Lord, being all that is described above, maintains the affairs of the creation, and by His so doing He gives salvation even to His enemies who are killed by Him. He is attractive even to the topmost liberated soul, and thus He is worshipable even by Brahm&#257; and &#346;iva, the greatest of all demigods. Even in His incarnation of <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a-avat&#257;ra</span> He is the Lord of the creative energy.

He is the control switch of the material energy, and to control the material energy in the innumerable universes, He is the root cause of innumerable incarnations in all the universes. There are more than five hundred thousand incarnations of Manu in only one universe, besides other incarnations in different universes. In the spiritual world, however, beyond the <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva,</span> there is no question of incarnations, but there are plenary expansions of the Lord in different Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;has.

When God-made <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma,</span> which is strictly meant for developing animal consciousness into human consciousness and human consciousness into godly consciousness, is broken by advancement of foolishness, the whole system of peaceful and progressive life is at once disturbed.

In the present age, consideration of the necessary qualification is being neglected, and the false birthright claim is being supported even by a popular, sophisticated poet, the author of <span class="Italic">R&#257;ma-carita-m&#257;nasa.</span></div>

<div class="Translation">Lak&#7779;m&#299;j&#299;, the goddess of fortune, whose glance of grace was sought by demigods like Brahm&#257; and for whom they surrendered many a day unto the Personality of Godhead, gave up her own abode in the forest of lotus flowers and engaged herself in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord. I was endowed with specific powers to supersede the fortune of all the three planetary systems by being decorated with the impressions of the flag, thunderbolt, elephant-driving rod and lotus flower, which are signs of the lotus feet of the Lord. But at the end, when I felt I was so fortunate, the Lord left me.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The beauty and opulence of the world can be enhanced by the grace of the Lord and not by any manmade planning. When the Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was present on this earth, the impressions of the special signs of His lotus feet were stamped on the dust, and as a result of this specific grace, the whole earth was made as perfect as possible. In other words, the rivers, the seas, the forests, the hills and the mines, which are the supplying agents for the necessities of men and animals, were fully discharging their respective duties. Therefore the riches of the world surpassed all the riches of all other planets in the three planetary systems of the universe. One should, therefore, ask that the grace of the Lord always be present on earth so that we may be favored with His causeless mercy and be happy, having all necessities of life. One may ask how we can detain the Supreme Lord on this earth after His mission is fulfilled and He has left this earth for His own abode. The answer is that there is no need to detain the Lord. The Lord, being omnipresent, can be present with us if we want Him at all. By His omnipresence, He can always be with us if we are attached to His devotional service by hearing, chanting, remembering, etc.</div>
<div class="Purport">There is nothing in the world with which the Lord is disconnected. The only thing we must learn is to excavate the source of connection and thus be linked with Him by offenseless service. We can be connected with Him by the transcendental sound representation of the Lord. The holy name of the Lord and the Lord Himself are identical, and one who chants the holy name of the Lord in an offenseless manner can at once realize that the Lord is present before him. Even by the vibration of radio sound, we can partially realize sound relativity, and by resounding the sound of transcendence we can verily feel the presence of the Lord. In this age, when everything is polluted by the contamination of Kali, it is instructed in the scriptures and preached by Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu that by chanting the holy name of the Lord, we can at once be free from contamination and gradually rise to the status of transcendence and go back to Godhead. The offenseless chanter of the holy name of the Lord is as auspicious as the Lord Himself, and the movement of pure devotees of the Lord all over the world can at once change the troublesome face of the world. Only by the propagation of the chanting of the holy name of the Lord can we be immune from all effects of the age of Kali.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The next symptom of the age of Kali is the distressed condition of the cow. Milking the cow means drawing the principles of religion in a liquid form. The great <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is</span> and <span class="Italic">munis</span> would live only on milk. &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; would go to a householder while he was milking a cow, and he would simply take a little quantity of it for subsistence. Even fifty years ago, no one would deprive a <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhu</span> of a quart or two of milk, and every householder would give milk like water. For a San&#257;tanist (a follower of Vedic principles) it is the duty of every householder to have cows and bulls as household paraphernalia, not only for drinking milk, but also for deriving religious principles. The San&#257;tanist worships cows on religious principles and respects <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> The cow's milk is required for the sacrificial fire, and by performing sacrifices the householder can be happy. The cow's calf not only is beautiful to look at, but also gives satisfaction to the cow, and so she delivers as much milk as possible. But in the Kali-yuga, the calves are separated from the cows as early as possible for purposes which may not be mentioned in these pages of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> The cow stands with tears in her eyes, the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> milkman draws milk from the cow artificially, and when there is no milk the cow is sent to be slaughtered. These greatly sinful acts are responsible for all the troubles in present society. People do not know what they are doing in the name of economic development. The influence of Kali will keep them in the darkness of ignorance. Despite all endeavors for peace and prosperity, they must try to see the cows and the bulls happy in all respects. Foolish people do not know how one earns happiness by making the cows and bulls happy, but it is a fact by the law of nature. Let us take it from the authority of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> and adopt the principles for the total happiness of humanity.</div>

The <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> king is considered to be the representative of God to give protection to the helpless and chastise the miscreants. Whenever there are anomalies in this routine work by the administrators, there is an incarnation of the Lord to reestablish the principles of a godly kingdom. In the age of Kali, the poor helpless animals, especially the cows, which are meant to receive all sorts of protection from the administrative heads, are killed without restriction. Thus the administrative heads under whose noses such things happen are representatives of God in name only. Such powerful administrators are rulers of the poor citizens by dress or office, but factually they are worthless, lower-class men without the cultural assets of the twice-born. No one can expect justice or equality of treatment from once-born (spiritually uncultured) lower-class men. Therefore in the age of Kali everyone is unhappy due to the maladministration of the state. The modern human society is not twice-born by spiritual culture. Therefore the people's government, by the people who are not twice-born, must be a government of Kali in which everyone is unhappy.</div>

Similarly, it is the duty of the government to kill at once all bad social elements such as thieves, dacoits and murderers. The same punishment is also due to animal-killers because the animals of the state are also the <span class="Italic">praj&#257;.</span> <span class="Italic">Praj&#257;</span> means one who has taken birth in the state, and this includes both men and animals. Any living being who takes birth in a state has the primary right to live under the protection of the king. The jungle animals are also subject to the king, and they also have a right to live. So what to speak of domestic animals like the cows and bulls.</div>
<div class="Purport">Any living being, if he terrifies other living beings, is a most wretched subject, and the king should at once kill such a disturbing element. As the wild animal is killed when it creates disturbances, similarly any man who unnecessarily kills or terrifies the jungle animals or other animals must be punished at once. By the law of the Supreme Lord, all living beings, in whatever shape they may be, are the sons of the Lord, and no one has any right to kill another animal, unless it is so ordered by the codes of natural law. The tiger can kill a lower animal for his subsistence, but a man cannot kill an animal for his subsistence. That is the law of God, who has created the law that a living being subsists by eating another living being. Thus the vegetarians are also living by eating other living beings. Therefore, the law is that one should live only by eating specific living beings, as ordained by the law of God. The <span class="Italic">&#298;&#347;opani&#7779;ad</span> directs that one should live by the direction of the Lord and not at one's sweet will. A man can subsist on varieties of grains, fruits and milk ordained by God, and there is no need of animal food, save and except in particular cases.</div>
<div class="Purport">The illusioned king or executive head, even though sometimes advertised as a great philosopher and learned scholar, will allow slaughterhouses in the state without knowing that torturing poor animals clears the way to hell for such foolish kings or executive heads. The executive head must always be alert to the safety of the <span class="Italic">praj&#257;s,</span> both man and animal, and inquire whether a particular living being is harassed at any place by another living being. The harassing living being must at once be caught and put to death, as shown by Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it.</div>
<div class="Purport">The people's government, or government by the people, should not allow killing of innocent animals by the sweet will of foolish government men. They must know the codes of God, as mentioned in the revealed scriptures. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it quotes here that according to the codes of God the irresponsible king or state executive jeopardizes his good name, duration of life, power and strength and ultimately his progressive march towards a better life and salvation after death. Such foolish men do not even believe in the existence of a next life.</div>
<div class="Purport">While commenting on this particular verse, we have in our presence the statement of a great modern politician who has recently died and left his will, which discloses his poor fund of knowledge of the codes of God mentioned by Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it. The politician was so ignorant of the codes of God that he writes: "I do not believe in any such ceremonies, and to submit to them, even as a matter of form, would be hypocrisy and an attempt to delude ourselves and others... I have no religious sentiment in the matter."</div>
<div class="Purport">Contrasting these statements of a great politician in the modern age with those of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, we find a vast difference. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was pious according to the scriptural codes, whereas the modern politician goes by his personal belief and sentiments. Any great man of the material world is, after all, a conditioned soul. He is bound by his hands and feet by the ropes of material nature, and still the foolish conditioned soul thinks of himself as free to act by his whimsical sentiments. The conclusion is that people in the time of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it were happy, and the animals were given proper protection because the executive head was not whimsical or ignorant of God's law. Foolish, faithless creatures try to avoid the existence of the Lord and proclaim themselves secular at the cost of valuable human life. The human life is especially meant for knowing the science of God, but foolish creatures, especially in this age of Kali, instead of knowing God scientifically, make propaganda against religious belief as well as the existence of God, even though they are always bound by the laws of God by the symptoms of birth, death, old age and disease.</div>

But when the executive heads are strong enough to curb all sorts of dishonest miscreants, in any part of the state, certainly they cannot flourish. When the miscreants are punished in an exemplary manner, automatically all good fortune follows. As said before, it is the prime duty of the king or the executive head to give protection in all respects to the peaceful, offenseless citizens of the state. The devotees of the Lord are by nature peaceful and offenseless, and therefore it is the prime duty of the state to arrange to convert everyone to become a devotee of the Lord. Thus automatically there will be peaceful, offenseless citizens. Then the only duty of the king will be to curb the dishonest miscreants.

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">O greatest among human beings, it is very difficult to ascertain the particular miscreant who has caused our sufferings, because we are bewildered by all the different opinions of theoretical philosophers.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">There are many theoretical philosophers in the world who put forward their own theories of cause and effect especially about the cause of suffering and its effect on different living beings. Generally there are six great philosophers: Ka&#7751;&#257;da, the author of Vai&#347;e&#7779;ika philosophy; Gautama, the author of logic; Pata&ntilde;jali, the author of mystic <span class="Italic">yoga;</span> Kapila, the author of S&#257;&#7749;khya philosophy; Jaimini, the author of Karma-m&#299;m&#257;&#7745;s&#257;; and Vy&#257;sadeva, the author of Ved&#257;nta-dar&#347;ana.</div>
<div class="Purport">Although the bull, or the personality of religion, and the cow, the personality of the earth, knew perfectly well that the personality of Kali was the direct cause of their sufferings, still, as devotees of the Lord, they knew well also that without the sanction of the Lord no one could inflict trouble upon them. According to the <span class="Italic">Padma Pur&#257;&#7751;a,</span> our present trouble is due to the fructifying of seedling sins, but even those seedling sins also gradually fade away by execution of pure devotional service. Thus even if the devotees see the mischief-mongers, they do not accuse them for the sufferings inflicted. They take it for granted that the mischief-monger is made to act by some indirect cause, and therefore they tolerate the sufferings, thinking them to be God-given in small doses, for otherwise the sufferings should have been greater.</div>
<div class="Purport">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it wanted to get a statement of accusation against the direct mischief-monger, but they declined to give it on the abovementioned grounds. Speculative philosophers, however, do not recognize the sanction of the Lord; they try to find out the cause of sufferings in their own way, as will be described in the following verses. According to &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;, such speculators are themselves bewildered, and thus they cannot know that the ultimate cause of all causes is the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation">Some of the philosophers, who deny all sorts of duality, declare that one's own self is responsible for his personal happiness and distress. Others say that superhuman powers are responsible, while yet others say that activity is responsible, and the gross materialists maintain that nature is the ultimate cause.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">As referred to above, philosophers like Jaimini and his followers establish that fruitive activity is the root cause of all distress and happiness, and that even if there is a superior authority, some superhuman powerful God or gods, He or they are also under the influence of fruitive activity because they reward result according to one's action. They say that action is not independent because action is performed by some performer; therefore, the performer himself is the cause of his own happiness or distress. In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index51c3.html?g=2102">6.5</a>) also it is confirmed that by one's mind, freed from material affection, one can deliver himself from the sufferings of material pangs. So one should not entangle oneself in matter by the mind's material affections. Thus one's own mind is one's friend or enemy in one's material happiness and distress.</div>
<div class="Purport">Atheistic, materialistic S&#257;&#7749;khyaites conclude that material nature is the cause of all causes. According to them, combinations of material elements are the causes of material happiness and distress, and disintegration of matter is the cause of freedom from all material pangs. Gautama and Ka&#7751;&#257;da find that atomic combination is the cause of everything, and impersonalists like A&#7779;&#7789;&#257;vakra discover that the spiritual effulgence of Brahman is the cause of all causes. But in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the Lord Himself declares that He is the source of impersonal Brahman, and therefore He, the Personality of Godhead, is the ultimate cause of all causes. It is also confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> that Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the ultimate cause of all causes.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Vai&#7779;&#7751;avites, the devotees of the Lord, do believe, as above explained, that nothing can take place without the sanction of the Supreme Lord. He is the supreme director, for He confirms in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a>) that He, as all-pervading Param&#257;tm&#257;, stays in everyone's heart and keeps vigilance over all actions and witnesses all activities. The argument of the atheist that one cannot be punished for one's misdeeds unless proved before a qualified justice is refuted herein, for we accept the perpetual witness and constant companion of the living being. A living being may forget all that he might have done in his past or present life, but one must know that in the same tree of the material body, the individual soul and the Supreme Soul as Param&#257;tm&#257; are sitting like two birds. One of them, the living being, is enjoying the fruits of the tree, whereas the Supreme Being is there to witness the activities. Therefore the Param&#257;tm&#257; feature, the Supreme Soul, is actually the witness of all activities of the living being, and only by His direction can the living being remember or forget what he might have done in the past. He is, therefore, both the all-pervading impersonal Brahman and the localized Param&#257;tm&#257; in everyone's heart. He is the knower of all past, present and future, and nothing can be concealed from Him. The devotees know this truth, and therefore they discharge their duties sincerely, without being overly anxious for rewards. Besides that, one cannot estimate the Lord's reactions, either by speculation or by scholarship. Why does He put some into difficulty and not others? He is the supreme knower of the Vedic knowledge, and thus He is the factual Ved&#257;ntist. At the same time He is the compiler of the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta.</span> No one is independent of Him, and everyone is engaged in His service in different ways. In the conditioned state, such services are rendered by the living being under force of the material nature, whereas in the liberated state the living being is helped by the spiritual nature in the voluntary loving service of the Lord. There is no incongruity or inebriety in His actions. All are on the path of Absolute Truth. Bh&#299;&#7779;madeva correctly estimated the inconceivable actions of the Lord. The conclusion is, therefore, that the sufferings of the representative of religion and the representative of the earth, as present before Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, were planned to prove that Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was the ideal executive head because he knew well how to give protection to the cows (the earth) and the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> (religious principles), the two pillars of spiritual advancement. Everyone is under the full control of the Lord. He is quite correct in His action when He desires something to be done by someone, irrespective of the consideration of the particular case. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was thus put to test for his greatness. Now let us see how he solves it by his sagacious mind.</div>

<div class="Translation">The King said: O you, who are in the form of a bull! You know the truth of religion, and you are speaking according to the principle that the destination intended for the perpetrator of irreligious acts is also intended for one who identifies the perpetrator. You are no other than the personality of religion.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">A devotee's conclusion is that no one is directly responsible for being a benefactor or mischief-monger without the sanction of the Lord; therefore he does not consider anyone to be directly responsible for such action. But in both the cases he takes it for granted that either benefit or loss is God-sent, and thus it is His grace. In case of benefit, no one will deny that it is God-sent, but in case of loss or reverses one becomes doubtful about how the Lord could be so unkind to His devotee as to put him in great difficulty. Jesus Christ was seemingly put into such great difficulty, being crucified by the ignorant, but he was never angry at the mischief-mongers. That is the way of accepting a thing, either favorable or unfavorable. Thus for a devotee the identifier is equally a sinner, like the mischief-monger. By God's grace, the devotee tolerates all reverses. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it observed this, and therefore he could understand that the bull was no other than the personality of religion himself. In other words, a devotee has no suffering at all because so-called suffering is also God's grace for a devotee who sees God in everything. The cow and bull never placed any complaint before the King for being tortured by the personality of Kali, although everyone lodges such complaints before the state authorities. The extraordinary behavior of the bull made the King conclude that the bull was certainly the personality of religion, for no one else could understand the finer intricacies of the codes of religion.</div>

This doubtfulness was due to the contamination of both Kali and the material energy.

<div class="Translation">In the age of Satya [truthfulness] your four legs were established by the four principles of austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. But it appears that three of your legs are broken due to rampant irreligion in the form of pride, lust for women, and intoxication.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The deluding energy, or material nature, can act upon the living beings proportionately in terms of the living beings' falling prey to the deluding attraction of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> Moths are captivated by the glaring brightness of light, and thus they become prey to the fire. Similarly, the deluding energy is always captivating the conditioned souls to become prey to the fire of delusion, and the Vedic scriptures warn the conditioned souls not to become prey to delusion but to get rid of it. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> warn us to go not to the darkness of ignorance but to the progressive path of light. The Lord Himself also warns that the deluding power of material energy is too powerful to overcome, but one who completely surrenders unto the Lord can easily do so. But to surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord is also not very easy. Such surrender is possible by persons of austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. These four principles of advanced civilization were remarkable features in the age of Satya. In that age, every human being was practically a qualified <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> of the highest order, and in the social orders of life they were all <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sas,</span> or the topmost in the renounced order. By cultural standing, the human beings were not at all subjected to the deluding energy. Such strong men of character were competent enough to get away from the clutches of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> But gradually, as the basic principles of brahminical culture, namely austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness, became curtailed by proportionate development of pride, attachment for women and intoxication, the path of salvation or the path of transcendental bliss retreated far, far away from human society. With the progression of the age of Kali, people are becoming very proud, and attached to women and intoxication. By the influence of the age of Kali, even a pauper is proud of his penny, the women are always dressed in an overly attractive fashion to victimize the minds of men, and the man is addicted to drinking wine, smoking, drinking tea and chewing tobacco, etc. All these habits, or so-called advancement of civilization, are the root causes of all irreligiosities, and therefore it is not possible to check corruption, bribery and nepotism. Man cannot check all these evils simply by statutory acts and police vigilance, but he can cure the disease of the mind by the proper medicine, namely advocating the principles of brahminical culture or the principles of austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. Modern civilization and economic development are creating a new situation of poverty and scarcity with the result of blackmailing the consumer's commodities. If the leaders and the rich men of the society spend fifty percent of their accumulated wealth mercifully for the misled mass of people and educate them in God consciousness, the knowledge of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> certainly the age of Kali will be defeated in its attempt to entrap the conditioned souls. We must always remember that false pride, or too high an estimation of one's own values of life, undue attachment to women or association with them, and intoxication will divert human civilization from the path of peace, however much the people clamor for peace in the world. The preaching of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> principles will automatically render all men austere, clean both inside and outside, merciful to the suffering, and truthful in daily behavior. That is the way of correcting the flaws of human society, which are very prominently exhibited at the present moment.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The principles of religion do not stand on some dogmas or manmade formulas, but they stand on four primary regulative observances, namely austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. The mass of people must be taught to practice these principles from childhood. Austerity means to accept voluntarily things which may not be very comfortable for the body but are conducive for spiritual realization, for example, fasting. Fasting twice or four times a month is a sort of austerity which may be voluntarily accepted for spiritual realization only, and not for any other purposes, political or otherwise. Fastings which are meant not for self-realization but for some other purposes are condemned in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index1999.html?g=5243">17.5</a>-6). Similarly, cleanliness is necessary both for the mind and for the body. Simply bodily cleanliness may help to some extent, but cleanliness of the mind is necessary, and it is effected by glorifying the Supreme Lord. No one can cleanse the accumulated mental dust without glorifying the Supreme Lord. A godless civilization cannot cleanse the mind because it has no idea of God, and for this simple reason people under such a civilization cannot have good qualifications, however they may be materially equipped. We have to see things by their resultant action. The resultant action of human civilization in the age of Kali is dissatisfaction, so everyone is anxious to get peace of mind. This peace of mind was complete in the Satya age because of the existence of the above-mentioned attributes of the human beings. Gradually these attributes have diminished in the Tret&#257;-yuga to three fourths, in the Dv&#257;para to half, and in this age of Kali to one fourth, which is also gradually diminishing on account of prevailing untruthfulness. By pride, either artificial or real, the resultant action of austerity is spoiled; by too much affection for female association, cleanliness is spoiled; by too much addiction to intoxication, mercy is spoiled; and by too much lying propaganda, truthfulness is spoiled. The revival of <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavata-dharma</span> can save human civilization from falling prey to evils of all description.</div>

These demigods are indirect, qualitative representations of the Supreme Lord. A learned scholar or devotee, however, knows who is who.

Those who are not so learned worship such qualitative, material representations, but their worship is unceremonious because it is irregular.</div>

The personality of Kali also, after attempting to get rid of the punishment in various ways, decided that he must surrender unto him, and thus he began to tremble in fear of his life. The king, or the executive head, must be so strong as to stand before the personality of Kali like the personality of death, Yamar&#257;ja. The King's order must be obeyed, otherwise the culprit's life is in risk. That is the way to rule the personalities of Kali who create disturbance in the normal life of the state citizens.</div>

<div class="Translation">S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; said: Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, thus being petitioned by the personality of Kali, gave him permission to reside in places where gambling, drinking, prostitution and animal slaughter were performed.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The basic principles of irreligiosity, such as pride, prostitution, intoxication and falsehood, counteract the four principles of religion, namely austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. The personality of Kali was given permission to live in four places particularly mentioned by the King, namely the place of gambling, the place of prostitution, the place of drinking and the place of animal slaughter.</div>
<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; directs that drinking against the principles of scriptures, such as the <span class="Italic">sautr&#257;ma&#7751;&#299;-yaj&ntilde;a,</span> association with women outside marriage, and killing animals against the injunctions of scriptures are irreligious. In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> two different types of injunctions are there for the <span class="Italic">prav&#7771;ttas,</span> or those who are engaged in material enjoyment, and for the <span class="Italic">niv&#7771;ttas,</span> or those who are liberated from material bondage. The Vedic injunction for the <span class="Italic">prav&#7771;ttas</span> is to gradually regulate their activities towards the path of liberation. Therefore, for those who are in the lowest stage of ignorance and who indulge in wine, women and flesh, drinking by performing <span class="Italic">sautr&#257;ma&#7751;&#299;-yaj&ntilde;a,</span> association of women by marriage and flesh-eating by sacrifices are sometimes recommended. Such recommendations in the Vedic literature are meant for a particular class of men, and not for all. But because they are injunctions of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> for particular types of persons, such activities by the <span class="Italic">prav&#7771;ttas</span> are not considered <span class="Italic">adharma.</span> One man's food may be poison for others; similarly, what is recommended for those in the mode of ignorance may be poison for those in the mode of goodness. &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; Prabhu, therefore, affirms that recommendations in the scriptures for a certain class of men are never to be considered <span class="Italic">adharma,</span> or irreligious. But such activities are factually <span class="Italic">adharma,</span> and they are never to be encouraged. The recommendations in the scriptures are not meant for the encouragement of such <span class="Italic">adharma,</span> but for regulating the necessary <span class="Italic">adharma</span> gradually toward the path of <span class="Italic">dharma.</span></div>
<div class="Purport">Following in the footsteps of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, it is the duty of all executive heads of states to see that the principles of religion, namely austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness, are established in the state, and that the principles of irreligion, namely pride, illicit female association or prostitution, intoxication and falsity, are checked by all means. And to make the best use of a bad bargain, the personality of Kali may be transferred to places of gambling, drinking, prostitution and slaughterhouses, if there are any places like that. Those who are addicted to these irreligious habits may be regulated by the injunctions of the scripture. In no circumstances should they be encouraged by any state. In other words, the state should categorically stop all sorts of gambling, drinking, prostitution and falsity. The state which wants to eradicate corruption by majority may introduce the principles of religion in the following manner:</div>
<div class="Purport">1. Two compulsory fasting days in a month, if not more (austerity). Even from the economic point of view, such two fasting days in a month in the state will save tons of food, and the system will also act very favorably on the general health of the citizens.</div>
<div class="Purport">2. There must be compulsory marriage of young boys and girls attaining twenty-four years of age and sixteen years of age respectively. There is no harm in coeducation in the schools and colleges, provided the boys and girls are duly married, and in case there is any intimate connection between a male and female student, they should be married properly without illicit relation. The divorce act is encouraging prostitution, and this should be abolished.</div>
<div class="Purport">3. The citizens of the state must give in charity up to fifty percent of their income for the purpose of creating a spiritual atmosphere in the state or in human society, both individually and collectively. They should preach the principles of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> by (a) <span class="Italic">karma-yoga,</span> or doing everything for the satisfaction of the Lord, (b) regular hearing of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> from authorized persons or realized souls, (c) chanting of the glories of the Lord congregationally at home or at places of worship, (d) rendering all kinds of service to <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavatas</span> engaged in preaching <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> and (e) residing in a place where the atmosphere is saturated with God consciousness. If the state is regulated by the above process, naturally there will be God consciousness everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purport">Gambling of all description, even speculative business enterprise, is considered to be degrading, and when gambling is encouraged in the state, there is a complete disappearance of truthfulness. Allowing young boys and girls to remain unmarried more than the above-mentioned ages and licensing animal slaughterhouses of all description should be at once prohibited. The flesh-eaters may be allowed to take flesh as mentioned in the scriptures, and not otherwise. Intoxication of all description-even smoking cigarettes, chewing tobacco or the drinking of tea-must be prohibited.</div>

<div class="Translation">The personality of Kali asked for something more, and because of his begging, the King gave him permission to live where there is gold because wherever there is gold there is also falsity, intoxication, lust, envy and enmity.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Although Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it gave Kali permission to live in four places, it was very difficult for him to find the places because during the reign of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it there were no such places. Therefore Kali asked the King to give him something practical which could be utilized for his nefarious purposes. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it thus gave him permission to live in a place where there is gold, because wherever there is gold there are all the above-mentioned four things, and over and above them there is enmity also. So the personality of Kali became gold-standardized. According to <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> gold encourages falsity, intoxication, prostitution, envy and enmity. Even a gold-standard exchange and currency is bad. Gold-standard currency is based on falsehood because the currency is not on a par with the reserved gold. The basic principle is falsity because currency notes are issued in value beyond that of the actual reserved gold. This artificial inflation of currency by the authorities encourages prostitution of the state economy. The price of commodities becomes artificially inflated because of bad money, or artificial currency notes. Bad money drives away good money. Instead of paper currency, actual gold coins should be used for exchange, and this will stop prostitution of gold. Gold ornaments for women may be allowed by control, not by quality, but by quantity. This will discourage lust, envy and enmity. When there is actual gold currency in the form of coins, the influence of gold in producing falsity, prostitution, etc., will automatically cease. There will be no need of an anticorruption ministry for another term of prostitution and falsity of purpose.</div>

<div class="Translation">Thereafter the King reestablished the lost legs of the personality of religion [the bull], and by encouraging activities he sufficiently improved the condition of the earth.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">By designating particular places for the personality of Kali, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it practically cheated Kali. In the presence of Kali, Dharma (in the shape of a bull), and the earth (in the shape of a cow), he could actually estimate the general condition of his kingdom, and therefore he at once took proper steps to reestablish the legs of the bull, namely austerity, cleanliness and mercy. And for the general benefit of the people of the world, he saw that the gold stock might be employed for stabilization. Gold is certainly a generator of falsity, intoxication, prostitution, enmity and violence, but under the guidance of a proper king or public leader, or a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> or <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;,</span> the same gold can be properly utilized to reestablish the lost legs of the bull, the personality of religion.</div>
<div class="Purport">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, therefore, like his grandfather Arjuna, collected all illicit gold kept for the propensities of Kali and employed it in the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana-yaj&ntilde;a,</span> as per instruction of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> As we have suggested before, one's accumulated wealth may be divided into three parts for distribution, namely fifty percent for the service of the Lord, twenty-five percent for the family members and twenty-five percent for personal necessities. Spending fifty percent for the service of the Lord or for propagation of spiritual knowledge in society by way of the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana-yaj&ntilde;a</span> is the maximum display of human mercy. people of the world are generally in darkness regarding spiritual knowledge, especially in regard to the devotional service of the Lord, and therefore to propagate the systematic transcendental knowledge of devotional service is the greatest mercy that one can show in this world. When everyone is taught to sacrifice fifty percent of his accumulated gold for the Lord's service, certainly austerity, cleanliness and mercy automatically ensue, and thus the lost three legs of the personality of religion are automatically established. When there is sufficient austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness, naturally mother earth is completely satisfied, and there is very little chance for Kali to infiltrate the structure of human society.</div>

<div class="Translation">The most fortunate Emperor Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, who was entrusted with the kingdom of Hastin&#257;pura by Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira when he desired to retire to the forest, is now ruling the world with great success due to his being glorified by the deeds of the kings of the Kuru dynasty.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The prolonged sacrificial ceremonies undertaken by the sages of Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya were begun shortly after the demise of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it. The sacrifice was to continue for one thousand years, and it is understood that in the beginning some of the contemporaries of Baladeva, the elder brother of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, also visited the sacrificial place. According to some authorities, the present tense is also used to indicate the nearest margin of time from the past. In that sense, the present tense is applied to the reign of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it here. For a continuous fact, also, present tense can be used. The principles of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it can be still continued, and human society can still be improved if there is determination by the authorities. We can still purge out from the state all the activities of immorality introduced by the personality of Kali if we are determined to take action like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it. He allotted some place for Kali, but in fact Kali could not find such places in the world at all because Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was strictly vigilant to see that there were no places for gambling, drinking, prostitution and animal slaughter. Modern administrators want to banish corruption from the state, but fools as they are, they do not know how to do it. They want to issue licenses for gambling houses, wine and other intoxicating drug houses, brothels, hotel prostitution and cinema houses, and falsity in every dealing, even in their own, and they want at the same time to drive out corruption from the state. They want the kingdom of God without God consciousness. How can it be possible to adjust two contradictory matters? If we want to drive out corruption from the state, we must first of all organize society to accept the principles of religion, namely austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness, and to make the condition favorable we must close all places of gambling, drinking, prostitution and falsity. These are some of the practical lessons from the pages of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span></div>

Both of them are the pillars of all happiness, and therefore they are meant for full cooperation for common welfare. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was experienced enough to drive away Kali from his field of activities and thereby make the state receptive to spiritual enlightenment. If the common people are not receptive, it is very difficult to impress upon them the necessity of spiritual enlightenment. Austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness, the basic principles of religion, prepare the ground for the reception of advancement in spiritual knowledge, and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it made this favorable condition possible. Thus the <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is</span> of Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya were able to perform the sacrifices for a thousand years.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The word <span class="Italic">ajita</span> is significant here. The Personality of Godhead, &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, is known as Ajita, or unconquerable, and He is so in every respect. No one can know His actual position. He is unconquerable by knowledge also. We have heard about His <span class="Italic">dh&#257;ma,</span> or place, eternal Goloka V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, but there are many scholars who interpret this abode in different ways. But by the grace of a spiritual master like &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, unto whom the King gave himself up as a most humble disciple, one is able to understand the actual position of the Lord, His eternal abode, and His transcendental paraphernalia in that <span class="Italic">dh&#257;ma,</span> or abode. Knowing the transcendental position of the Lord and the transcendental method by which one can approach that transcendental <span class="Italic">dh&#257;ma,</span> the King was confident about his ultimate destination, and by knowing this he could leave aside everything material, even his own body, without any difficulty of attachment. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> it is stated, <span class="Italic">para&#7745; d&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;v&#257; nivartate: </I>[</span><I>Bg</I>. 9.59</I>]</I> one can give up all connection with material attachment when one is able to see the <span class="Italic">param,</span> or the superior quality of things. From <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> we understand the quality of the Lord's energy that is superior to the material quality of energy, and by the grace of a bona fide spiritual master like &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, it is quite possible to know everything of the superior energy of the Lord by which the Lord manifests His eternal name, quality, pastimes, paraphernalia and variegatedness. Unless one thoroughly understands this superior or eternal energy of the Lord, it is not possible to leave the material energy, however one may theoretically speculate on the true nature of the Absolute Truth. By the grace of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was able to receive the mercy of such a personality as &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, and thus he was able to know the actual position of the unconquerable Lord. It is very difficult to find the Lord from the Vedic literatures, but it is very easy to know Him by the mercy of a liberated devotee like &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The highest perfection of life is attained by remembering the transcendental nature of the Lord at the last moment of one's life. This perfection of life is made possible by one who has learned the actual transcendental nature of the Lord from the Vedic hymns sung by a liberated soul like &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; or someone in that line of disciplic succession. There is no gain in hearing the Vedic hymns from some mental speculator. When the same is heard from an actual self-realized soul and is properly understood by service and submission, everything becomes transparently clear. Thus a submissive disciple is able to live transcendentally and continue to the end of life. By scientific adaptation, one is able to remember the Lord even at the end of life, when the power of remembrance is slackened due to derangement of bodily membranes. For a common man, it is very difficult to remember things as they are at the time of death, but by the grace of the Lord and His bona fide devotees, the spiritual masters, one can get this opportunity without difficulty. And it was done in the case of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it.</div>

<div class="Translation">The very day and moment the Personality of Godhead, Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, left this earth, the personality of Kali, who promotes all kinds of irreligious activities, came into this world.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The Personality of Godhead and His holy name, qualities, etc., are all identical. The personality of Kali was not able to enter the jurisdiction of the earth due to the presence of the Personality of Godhead. And similarly, if there is an arrangement for the constant chanting of the holy names, qualities, etc., of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no chance at all for the personality of Kali to enter. That is the technique of driving away the personality of Kali from the world. In modernized human society there are great advancements of material science, and they have invented the radio to distribute sound in the air. So instead of vibrating some nuisance sound for sense enjoyment, if the state arranges to distribute transcendental sound by resounding the holy name, fame and activities of the Lord, as they are authorized in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> or <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> then a favorable condition will be created, the principles of religion in the world will be reestablished, and thus the executive heads, who are so anxious to drive away corruption from the world, will be successful. Nothing is bad if properly used for the service of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The age of Kali is called the fallen age. In this fallen age, because the living beings are in an awkward position, the Supreme Lord has given some special facilities to them. So by the will of the Lord, a living being does not become a victim of a sinful act until the act is actually performed. In other ages, simply by thinking of performing a sinful act, one used to become a victim of the act. On the contrary, a living being in this age is awarded with the results of pious acts simply by thinking of them. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, being the most learned and experienced king by the grace of the Lord, was not unnecessarily envious of the personality of Kali because he did not intend to give him any chance to perform any sinful act. He protected his subjects from falling prey to the sinful acts of the age of Kali, and at the same time he gave full facility to the age of Kali by allotting him some particular places. At the end of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> it is said that even though all nefarious activities of the personality of Kali are present, there is a great advantage in the age of Kali. One can attain salvation simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord. Thus Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it made an organized effort to propagate the chanting of the Lord's holy name, and thus he saved the citizens from the clutches of Kali. It is for this advantage only that great sages sometimes wish all good for the age of Kali. In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> also it is said that by discourse on Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's activities, one can get rid of all the disadvantages of the age of Kali.

Any discrepancy in such sacrifices spoils the whole show, and the result is uncertain, like agricultural enterprises.

Unscrupulous greedy <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> of the age of Kali induce the innocent public to such uncertain sacrificial shows without disclosing the scriptural injunction that in the age of Kali there is no fruitful sacrificial performance but the sacrifice of the congregational chanting of the holy name of the Lord. S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; was narrating the transcendental activities of the Lord before the congregation of sages, and they were factually perceiving the result of hearing these transcendental activities.

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">The value of a moment's association with the devotee of the Lord cannot even be compared to the attainment of heavenly planets or liberation from matter, and what to speak of worldly benedictions in the form of material prosperity, which are for those who are meant for death.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">When there are some similar points, it is possible to compare one thing to another. One cannot compare the association of a pure devotee to anything material. Men who are addicted to material happiness aspire to reach the heavenly planets like the moon, Venus and Indraloka, and those who are advanced in material philosophical speculations aspire after liberation from all material bondage. When one becomes frustrated with all kinds of material advancement, one desires the opposite type of liberation, which is called <span class="Italic">apunar-bhava,</span> or no rebirth. But the pure devotees of the Lord do not aspire after the happiness obtained in the heavenly kingdom, nor do they aspire after liberation from material bondage. In other words, for the pure devotees of the Lord the material pleasures obtainable in the heavenly planets are like phantasmagoria, and because they are already liberated from all material conceptions of pleasure and distress, they are factually liberated even in the material world. This means that the pure devotees of the Lord are engaged in a transcendental existence, namely in the loving service of the Lord, both in the material world and in the spiritual world. As a government servant is always the same, either in the office or at home or at any place, so a devotee has nothing to do with anything material, for he is exclusively engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord. Since he has nothing to do with anything material, what pleasure can he derive from material benedictions like kingship or other overlordships, which are finished quickly with the end of the body? Devotional service is eternal; it has no end, because it is spiritual. Therefore, since the assets of a pure devotee are completely different from material assets, there is no comparison between the two. S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; was a pure devotee of the Lord, and therefore his association with the <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is</span> in Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya is unique. In the material world, association with gross materialists is veritably condemned. The materialist is called <span class="Italic">yo&#7779;it-sa&#7749;g&#299;,</span> or one who is much attached to material entanglement (women and other paraphernalia). Such attachment is conditioned because it drives away the benedictions of life and prosperity. And just the opposite is <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavata-sa&#7749;g&#299;,</span> or one who is always in the association with the Lord's name, form, qualities, etc. Such association is always desirable; it is worshipable, it is praiseworthy, and one may accept it as the highest goal of life.</div>

<div class="Translation">The Personality of Godhead, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a [Govinda], is the exclusive shelter for all great living beings, and His transcendental attributes cannot even be measured by such masters of mystic powers as Lord &#346;iva and Lord Brahm&#257;. Can anyone who is expert in relishing nectar [rasa] ever be fully satiated by hearing topics about Him?</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Lord &#346;iva and Lord Brahm&#257; are two chiefs of the demigods. They are full of mystic powers. For example, Lord &#346;iva drank an ocean of poison of which one drop was sufficient to kill an ordinary living being. Similarly, Brahm&#257; could create many powerful demigods, including Lord &#346;iva. So they are <span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;varas,</span> or lords of the universe. But they are not the supreme powerful. The supreme powerful is Govinda, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. He is the Transcendence, and His transcendental attributes cannot be measured even by such powerful <span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;varas</span> as &#346;iva and Brahm&#257;. Therefore Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the exclusive shelter of the greatest of all living beings. Brahm&#257; is counted amongst the living beings, but he is the greatest of all of us. And why is the greatest of all the living beings so much attached to the transcendental topics of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a? Because He is the reservoir of all enjoyment. Everyone wants to relish some kind of taste in everything, but one who is engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord can derive unlimited pleasure from such engagement. The Lord is unlimited, and His name, attributes, pastimes, entourage, variegatedness, etc. are unlimited, and those who relish them can do so unlimitedly and still not feel satiated. This fact is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Padma Pur&#257;&#7751;a:</span></div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">ramante yogino 'nante<br>saty&#257;nanda-cid-&#257;tmani<br>iti r&#257;ma-paden&#257;sau<br>para&#7745; brahm&#257;bhidh&#299;yate<br></I> [</I>Cc. Madhya <a href="indexdd6e.html?g=107212">9.29</a></I>]</I></div>
</div><A NAME="21510"></A>
<div class="After-Verse">"The mystics derive unlimited transcendental pleasures from the Absolute Truth, and therefore the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, is also known as R&#257;ma."</div>
<div class="Purport">There is no end to such transcendental discourses. In mundane affairs there is the law of satiation, but in transcendence there is no such satiation. S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; desired to continue the topics of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a before the sages of Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya, and the sages also expressed their readiness to hear from him continuously. Since the Lord is transcendence and His attributes are transcendental, such discourses increase the receptive mood of the purified audience.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The speaker on the transcendental activities of the Lord should have only one object of worship and service, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And the audience for such topics should be anxious to hear about Him. When such a combination is possible, namely a qualified speaker and a qualified audience, it is then and there very much congenial to continue discourses on the Transcendence. Professional speakers and a materially absorbed audience cannot derive real benefit from such discourses. Professional speakers make a show of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata-sapt&#257;ha</span> for the sake of family maintenance, and the materially disposed audience hears such discourses of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata-sapt&#257;ha</span> for some material benefit, namely religiosity, wealth, gratification of the senses, or liberation. Such <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> discourses are not purified from the contamination of the material qualities. But the discourses between the saints of Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya and &#346;r&#299; S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; are on the transcendental level. There is no motive for material gain. In such discourses, unlimited transcendental pleasure is relished both by the audience and by the speaker, and therefore they can continue the topics for many thousands of years. Now <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata-sapt&#257;has</span> are held for seven days only, and after finishing the show, both the audience and the speaker become engaged in material activities as usual. They can do so because the speaker is not <span class="Italic">bhagavat-pradh&#257;na</span> and the audience is not <span class="Italic">&#347;u&#347;r&#363;&#7779;at&#257;m,</span> as explained above.</div>

<div class="Translation">O S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299;, please describe those topics of the Lord by which Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, whose intelligence was fixed on liberation, attained the lotus feet of the Lord, who is the shelter of Garu&#7693;a, the King of birds. Those topics were vibrated by the son of Vy&#257;sa [&#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva].</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">There is some controversy amongst the students on the path of liberation. Such transcendental students are known as impersonalists and devotees of the Lord. The devotee of the Lord worships the transcendental form of the Lord, whereas the impersonalist meditates upon the glaring effulgence, or the bodily rays of the Lord, known as the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti.</span> Here in this verse it is said that Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it attained the lotus feet of the Lord by instructions in knowledge delivered by the son of Vy&#257;sadeva, &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was also an impersonalist in the beginning, as he himself has admitted in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bh&#257;gavatam</span></B> (<a href="indexff76.html?g=13393">2.1.9</a>), but later on he was attracted by the transcendental pastimes of the Lord and thus became a devotee. Such devotees with perfect knowledge are called <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavatas,</span> or first-class devotees. There are three classes of devotees, namely the <span class="Italic">pr&#257;k&#7771;ta, madhyama,</span> and <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata.</span> The <span class="Italic">pr&#257;k&#7771;ta,</span> or third-class devotees, are temple worshipers without specific knowledge of the Lord and the Lord's devotees. The <span class="Italic">madhyama,</span> or the second-class devotee, knows well the Lord, the Lord's devotees, the neophytes, and the nondevotees also. But the <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata,</span> or the first-class devotee, sees everything in relation with the Lord and the Lord present in everyone's relation. The <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata,</span> therefore, does not make any distinction, particularly between a devotee and nondevotee. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was such a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata</span> devotee because he was initiated by a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata</span> devotee, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;. He was equally kind, even to the personality of Kali, and what to speak of others.</div>
<div class="Purport">So there are many instances in the transcendental histories of the world of an impersonalist who has later become a devotee. But a devotee has never become an impersonalist. This very fact proves that on the transcendental steps, the step occupied by a devotee is higher than the step occupied by an impersonalist. It is also stated in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index3958.html?g=4186">12.5</a>) that persons stuck on the impersonal step undergo more sufferings than achievement of reality. Therefore knowledge imparted by &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; unto Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it helped him attain the service of the Lord. And this stage of perfection is called <span class="Italic">apavarga,</span> or the perfect stage of liberation. Simple knowledge of liberation is material knowledge. Actual freedom from material bondage is called liberation, but attainment of the transcendental service of the Lord is called the perfect stage of liberation. Such a stage is attained by knowledge and renunciation, as we have already explained (<span class="Ref_Italic">SB</span> <a href="index30a6.html?g=6433">1.2.12</a>), and perfect knowledge, as delivered by &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, results in the attainment of the transcendental service of the Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">&#346;r&#299; S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; said: O God, although we are born in a mixed caste, we are still promoted in birthright simply by serving and following the great who are advanced in knowledge. Even by conversing with such great souls, one can without delay cleanse oneself of all disqualifications resulting from lower births.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; did not take his birth in a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> family. He was born in a family of mixed caste, or an uncultured low family. But because of higher association, like &#346;r&#299; &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; and the great <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is</span> of Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya, certainly the disqualification of inferior birth was washed off. Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu followed this principle in pursuance of the Vedic usages, and by His transcendental association He elevated many lowborn, or those disqualified by birth or action, to the status of devotional service and established them in the position of <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas,</span> or authorities. He clearly stated that any man, whatever he may be, whether a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> or <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> by birth, or a householder or mendicant in the order of society, if he is conversant with the science of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, he can be accepted as an <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya</span> or <span class="Italic">guru,</span> a spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purport">S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; learned the science of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a from great <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is</span> and authorities like &#346;ukadeva and Vy&#257;sadeva and he was so qualified that even the sages of Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya eagerly wanted to hear from him the science of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in the form of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> So he had the double association of great souls by hearing and preaching. Transcendental science, or the science of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, has to be learned from the authorities, and when one preaches the science, he becomes still more qualified. So S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; had both the advantages, and thus undoubtedly he was completely freed from all disqualifications of low birth and mental agonies. This verse definitely proves that &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; did not refuse to teach S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; about the transcendental science nor did the sages of Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya refuse to hear lessons from him because of his inferior birth. This means that thousands of years ago there was no bar to learning or preaching the transcendental science because of inferior birth. The rigidity of the so-called caste system in Hindu society became prominent within only one hundred years or so when the number of <span class="Italic">dvija-bandhus,</span> or disqualified men in the families of higher castes, increased. Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya revived the original Vedic system, and He elevated &#7788;h&#257;kura Harid&#257;sa to the position of <span class="Italic">n&#257;m&#257;c&#257;rya,</span> or the authority in preaching the glories of the holy name of the Lord, although His Holiness &#346;r&#299;la Harid&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura was pleased to appear in a family of Mohammedans.</div>
<div class="Purport">Such is the power of pure devotees of the Lord. The Ganges water is accepted as pure, and one can become purified after taking a bath in the waters of the Ganges. But as far as the great devotees of the Lord are concerned, they can purify a degraded soul even by being seen by the lowborn, and what to speak of association. Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu wanted to purify the whole atmosphere of the polluted world by sending qualified preachers all over the world, and it remains with the Indians to take up this task scientifically and thus do the best kind of humanitarian work. The mental diseases of the present generation are more acute than bodily diseases; it is quite fit and proper to take up the preaching of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> all over the world without delay. <span class="Italic">Mahattam&#257;n&#257;m abhidh&#257;na</span> also means dictionary of great devotees, or a book full of the words of great devotees. Such a dictionary of the words of great devotees and those of the Lord are in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and allied literatures, specifically the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span></div>

<div class="First">The <span class="Italic">dvija-bandhu,</span> or the less intelligent, uncultured men born of higher castes, put forward many arguments against the lower caste men becoming <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> in this life. They argue that birth in a family of <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> or less than <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> is made possible by one's previous sinful acts and that one therefore has to complete the terms of disadvantages due to lower birth. And to answer these false logicians, <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> asserts that one who chants the holy name of the Lord under the direction of a pure devotee can at once get free from the disadvantages due to a lower-caste birth. A pure devotee of the Lord does not commit any offense while chanting the holy name of the Lord. There are ten different offenses in the chanting of the holy name of the Lord. To chant the holy name under the direction of a pure devotee is offenseless chanting. Offenseless chanting of the holy name of the Lord is transcendental, and, therefore, such chanting can at once purify one from the effects of all kinds of previous sins. This offenseless chanting indicates that one has fully understood the transcendental nature of the holy name and has thus surrendered unto the Lord. Transcendentally the holy name of the Lord and the Lord Himself are identical, being absolute. The holy name of the Lord is as powerful as the Lord. The Lord is the all-powerful Personality of Godhead, and He has innumerable names, which are all nondifferent from Him and are equally powerful also. In the last word of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the Lord asserts that one who surrenders fully unto Him is protected from all sins by the grace of the Lord. Since His name and He Himself are identical, the holy name of the Lord can protect the devotee from all effects of sins. The chanting of the holy name of the Lord can undoubtedly deliver one from the disadvantages of a lower caste birth. The Lord's unlimited power is extended on and on by the unlimited expansion of the devotees and incarnations, and thus every devotee of the Lord and incarnations also can be equally surcharged with the potency of the Lord. Since the devotee is surcharged with the potency of the Lord, even fractionally, the disqualification due to lower birth cannot stand in the way.</div>

Others ask for the favor of the goddess of fortune, and despite such prayers she declines to award such favors. But still she renders service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although He has nothing to accept from her. The Personality of Godhead in His Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u feature begets Brahm&#257;, the first created person in the material world, from His navel lotus stem and not in the womb of the goddess of fortune, who is eternally engaged in His service. These are some of the instances of His complete independence and perfection. That He has nothing to do does not mean that He is impersonal. He is transcendentally so full of inconceivable potencies that simply by His willing, everything is done without physical or personal endeavor. He is called, therefore, Yoge&#347;vara, or the Lord of all mystic powers.</div>

<div class="First">The conception of many gods in the Vedic literatures by the ignorant is completely wrong.

The living entities are not as powerful as the Lord's plenary expansions, and therefore there are two different types of expansions. Lord Brahm&#257; is generally one of the living entities, and Lord &#346;iva is the via medium between the Lord and the living entities. In other words, even demigods like Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord &#346;iva, who are the chief amongst all demigods, are never equal to or greater than Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

<div class="Translation">Self-controlled persons who are attached to the Supreme Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a can all of a sudden give up the world of material attachment, including the gross body and subtle mind, and go away to attain the highest perfection of the renounced order of life, by which nonviolence and renunciation are consequential.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Only the self-controlled can gradually be attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Self-controlled means not indulging in sense enjoyment more than is necessary. And those who are not self-controlled are given over to sense enjoyment. Dry philosophical speculation is a subtle sense enjoyment of the mind. Sense enjoyment leads one to the path of darkness. Those who are self-controlled can make progress on the path of liberation from the conditional life of material existence. The <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> therefore, enjoin that one should not go on the path of darkness but should make a progressive march towards the path of light or liberation. Self-control is actually achieved not by artificially stopping the senses from material enjoyment, but by becoming factually attached to the Supreme Lord by engaging one's unalloyed senses in the transcendental service of the Lord. The senses cannot be forcibly curbed, but they can be given proper engagement. Purified senses, therefore, are always engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord. This perfectional stage of sense engagement is called <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> So those who are attached to the means of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> are factually self-controlled and can all of a sudden give up their homely or bodily attachment for the service of the Lord. This is called the <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa</span> stage. <span class="Italic">Ha&#7745;sas,</span> or swans, accept only milk out of a mixture of milk and water. Similarly, those who accept the service of the Lord instead of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;'s</span> service are called the <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sas.</span> They are naturally qualified with all the good attributes, such as pridelessness, freedom from vanity, nonviolence, tolerance, simplicity, respectability, worship, devotion and sincerity. All these godly qualities exist in the devotee of the Lord spontaneously. Such <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sas,</span> who are completely given up to the service of the Lord, are very rare. They are very rare even amongst the liberated souls. Real nonviolence means freedom from envy. In this world everyone is envious of his fellow being. But a perfect <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa,</span> being completely given up to the service of the Lord, is perfectly nonenvious. He loves every living being in relation with the Supreme Lord. Real renunciation means perfect dependence on God. Every living being is dependent on someone else because he is so made. Actually everyone is dependent on the mercy of the Supreme Lord, but when one forgets his relation with the Lord, he becomes dependent on the conditions of material nature. Renunciation means renouncing ones dependence on the conditions of material nature and thus becoming completely dependent on the mercy of the Lord. Real independence means complete faith in the mercy of the Lord without dependence on the conditions of matter. This <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa</span> stage is the highest perfectional stage in <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> the process of devotional service to the Supreme Lord.</div>

<div class="First">The Supreme Lord is so kind to His pure devotees that in proper time He calls such devotees up to Him and thus creates an auspicious circumstance for the devotee. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was a pure devotee of the Lord, and there was no reason for him to become extremely fatigued, hungry and thirsty because a devotee of the Lord never becomes perturbed by such bodily demands. But by the desire of the Lord, even such a devotee can become apparently fatigued and thirsty just to create a situation favorable for his renunciation of worldly activities. One has to give up all attachment for worldly relations before one is able to go back to Godhead, and thus when a devotee is too much absorbed in worldly affairs, the Lord creates a situation to cause indifference. The Supreme Lord never forgets His pure devotee, even though he may be engaged in so-called worldly affairs. Sometimes He creates an awkward situation, and the devotee becomes obliged to renounce all worldly affairs. The devotee can understand by the signal of the Lord, but others take it to be unfavorable and frustrating. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was to become the medium for the revelation of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> by Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, as his grandfather Arjuna was the medium for the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> Had Arjuna not been taken up with an illusion of family affection by the will of the Lord, the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> would not have been spoken by the Lord Himself for the good of all concerned.

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">It appears that the <span class="Italic">muni,</span> in whose hermitage the King entered, was in yogic trance.

In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> also we have the information of the gradual development of perception from matter to a living entity. Our material mind and body develop from the living entity, the soul, and being influenced by the three qualities of matter, we forget our real identity. The <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na</span> process theoretically speculates about the reality of the soul. But <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> factually engages the spirit soul in activities. The perception of matter is transcended to still subtler states of the senses. The senses are transcended to the subtler mind, and then to breathing activities and gradually to intelligence. Beyond the intelligence, the living soul is realized by the mechanical activities of the <span class="Italic">yoga</span> system, or practice of meditation restraining the senses, regulating the breathing system and applying intelligence to rise to the transcendental position. This trance stops all material activities of the body. The King saw the <span class="Italic">muni</span> in that position. He also saw the <span class="Italic">muni</span> as follows.</div>

<div class="Translation">The King, not received by any formal welcome by means of being offered a seat, place, water and sweet addresses, considered himself neglected, and so thinking he became angry.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The law of reception in the codes of the Vedic principles states that even if an enemy is received at home, he must be received with all respects. He should not be given a chance to understand that he has come into the house of an enemy. When Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, accompanied by Arjuna and Bh&#299;ma, approached Jar&#257;sandha in Magadha, the respectable enemies were given a royal reception by King Jar&#257;sandha. The guest enemy, namely Bh&#299;ma, was to fight with Jar&#257;sandha, and yet they were given a grand reception. At night they used to sit down together as friends and guests, and in the day they used to fight, risking life and death. That was the law of reception. The reception law enjoins that a poor man, who has nothing to offer his guest, should be good enough to offer a straw mat for sitting, a glass of water for drinking and some sweet words. Therefore, to receive a guest, either friend or foe, there is no expense. It is only a question of good manners.</div>
<div class="Purport">When Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it entered the door of &#346;am&#299;ka &#7770;&#7779;i, he did not expect a royal reception by the <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;i</span> because he knew that saints and <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is</span> are not materially rich men. But he never expected that a seat of straw, a glass of water and some sweet words would be denied to him. He was not an ordinary guest, nor was he an enemy of the <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;i,</span> and therefore the cold reception by the <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;i</span> astonished the King greatly. As a matter of fact, the King was right to get angry with the <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;i</span> when he needed a glass of water very badly. To become angry in such a grave situation was not unnatural for the King, but because the King himself was not less than a great saint, his becoming angry and taking action were astonishing. So it must be accepted that it was so ordained by the supreme will of the Lord. The King was a great devotee of the Lord, and the saint was also as good as the King. But by the will of the Lord, the circumstances were so created that they became ways to the King's becoming unattached to family connection and governmental activities and thus becoming a completely surrendered soul unto the lotus feet of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The merciful Lord sometimes creates such awkward positions for his pure devotees in order to drag them towards Himself from the mire of material existence. But outwardly the situations appear to be frustrating to the devotees. The devotees of the Lord are always under the protection of the Lord, and in any condition, frustration or success, the Lord is the supreme guide for the devotees. The pure devotees, therefore, accept all conditions of frustration as blessings from the Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The King, being a devotee of the Lord, did not approve of his own action, and thus he began to wonder whether the sage was really in a trance or was just pretending in order to avoid receiving the King, who was a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> and therefore lower in rank. Repentance comes in the mind of a good soul as soon as he commits something wrong. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura and &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; do not believe that the King's action was due to his past misdeeds. The arrangement was so made by the Lord just to call the King back home, back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purport">According to &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299;, the plan was made by the will of the Lord, and by the will of the Lord the situation of frustration was created. The plan was that for his so-called misdeed the King could be cursed by an inexperienced <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> boy infected by the influence of Kali, and thus the King would leave his hearth and home for good. His connections with &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; would enable the presentation of the great <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> which is considered to be the book incarnation of the Lord. This book incarnation of the Lord gives much fascinating information of the transcendental pastimes of the Lord, like His <span class="Italic">r&#257;sa-l&#299;la</span> with the spiritual cowherd damsels of Vrajabh&#363;mi. This specific pastime of the Lord has a special significance because anyone who properly learns about this particular pastime of the Lord will certainly be dissuaded from mundane sex desire and be placed on the path of sublime devotional service to the Lord. The pure devotee's mundane frustration is meant to elevate the devotee to a higher transcendental position. By placing Arjuna and the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas in frustration due to the intrigue of their cousin-brothers, the prelude of the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra was created by the Lord. This was to incarnate the sound representative of the Lord, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> So by placing King Par&#299;k&#7779;it in an awkward position, the incarnation of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> was created by the will of the Lord. Being distressed by hunger and thirst was only a show, because the King endured much, even in the womb of his mother. He was never disturbed by the glaring heat of the <span class="Italic">brahm&#257;stra</span> released by A&#347;vatth&#257;m&#257;. The King's distressed condition was certainly unprecedented. The devotees like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it are powerful enough to forbear such distresses, by the will of the Lord, and they are never disturbed. The situation, in this case, was therefore all planned by the Lord.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are considered to be the head and brains of the social body, and the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> are considered to be the arms of the social body. The arms are required to protect the body from all harm, but the arms must act according to the directions of the head and brain. That is a natural arrangement made by the supreme order, for it is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> that four social orders or castes, namely the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas,</span> the <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas</span> and the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras,</span> are set up according to quality and work done by them. Naturally the son of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> has a good chance to become a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> by the direction of his qualified father, as a son of a medical practitioner has a very good chance to become a qualified medical practitioner. So the caste system is quite scientific. The son must take advantage of the father's qualification and thus become a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> or medical practitioner, and not otherwise. Without being qualified, one cannot become a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> or medical practitioner, and that is the verdict of all scriptures and social orders. Herein &#346;&#7771;&#7749;gi, a qualified son of a great <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> attained the required brahminical power both by birth and by training, but he was lacking in culture because he was an inexperienced boy. By the influence of Kali, the son of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> became puffed up with brahminical power and thus wrongly compared Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it to crows and watchdogs. The King is certainly the watchdog of the state in the sense that he keeps vigilant eyes over the border of the state for its protection and defense, but to address him as a watchdog is the sign of a less-cultured boy. Thus the downfall of the brahminical powers began as they gave importance to birthright without culture. The downfall of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> caste began in the age of Kali. And since <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are the heads of the social order, all other orders of society also began to deteriorate. This beginning of brahminical deterioration was highly deplored by the father of &#346;&#7771;&#7749;gi, as we will find.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">After explaining the general codes relating to the royal position and asserting that the king can do no wrong and therefore is never to be condemned, the sage &#346;am&#299;ka wanted to say something about Emperor Par&#299;k&#7779;it specifically. The specific qualification of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it is summarized herein. The King, even calculated as a king only, was most celebrated as a ruler who administered the religious principles of the royal order. In the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> the duties of all castes and orders of society are prescribed.

He was also a great devotee of the Lord and a self-realized soul. Cursing such a king, when he was tired and fatigued with hunger and thirst, was not at all proper. &#346;am&#299;ka &#7770;&#7779;i thus admitted from all sides that Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was cursed most unjustly.

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Then the &#7771;&#7779;i prayed to the all-pervading Personality of Godhead to pardon his immature boy, who had no intelligence and who committed the great sin of cursing a person who was completely free from all sins, who was subordinate and who deserved to be protected.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Everyone is responsible for his own action, either pious or sinful. &#7770;&#7779;i &#346;am&#299;ka could foresee that his son had committed a great sin by cursing Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, who deserved to be protected by the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> for he was a pious ruler and completely free from all sins because of his being a first-class devotee of the Lord. When an offense is done unto the devotee of the Lord, it is very difficult to overcome the reaction. The <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> being at the head of the social orders, are meant to give protection to their subordinates and not to curse them. There are occasions when a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> may furiously curse a subordinate <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> or <span class="Italic">vai&#347;ya,</span> etc., but in the case of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it there were no grounds, as already explained. The foolish boy had done it out of sheer vanity in being a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a's</span> son, and thus he became liable to be punished by the law of God. The Lord never forgives a person who condemns His pure devotee. Therefore, by cursing a king the foolish &#346;&#7771;&#7749;gi had committed not only a sin but also the greatest offense. Therefore the <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;i</span> could foresee that only the Supreme Personality of Godhead could save his boy from his sinful act. He therefore directly prayed for pardon from the Supreme Lord, who alone can undo a thing which is impossible to change. The appeal was made in the name of a foolish boy who had developed no intelligence at all.</div>
<div class="Purport">A question may be raised herein that since it was the desire of the Lord that Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja be put into that awkward position so that he might be delivered from material existence, then why was a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a's</span> son made responsible for this offensive act? The answer is that the offensive act was performed by a child only so that he could be excused very easily, and thus the prayer of the father was accepted. But if the question is raised why the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> community as a whole was made responsible for allowing Kali into the world affairs, the answer is given in the <span class="Italic">Var&#257;ha Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> that the demons who acted inimically toward the Personality of Godhead but were not killed by the Lord were allowed to take birth in the families of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> to take advantage of the age of Kali. The all-merciful Lord gave them a chance to have their births in the families of pious <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> so that they could progress toward salvation. But the demons, instead of utilizing the good opportunity, misused the brahminical culture due to being puffed up by vanity in becoming <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> The typical example is the son of &#346;am&#299;ka &#7770;&#7779;i, and all the foolish sons of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are warned hereby not to become as foolish as &#346;&#7771;&#7749;gi and be always on guard against the demoniac qualities which they had in their previous births. The foolish boy was, of course, excused by the Lord, but others, who may not have a father like &#346;am&#299;ka &#7770;&#7779;i, will be put into great difficulty if they misuse the advantages obtained by birth in a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> family.</div>

But he knew also that a pure devotee is callous about worldly advantages or reverses. As such, the devotees are never inclined to counteract personal defamation, curses, negligence, etc. As far as such things are concerned, in personal affairs the devotees do not care for them. But in the case of their being performed against the Lord and His devotees, then the devotees take very strong action. It was a personal affair, and therefore &#346;am&#299;ka &#7770;&#7779;i knew that the King would not take counteraction. Thus there was no alternative than to place an appeal to the Lord for the immature boy.</div>
<div class="Purport">It is not that only the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are powerful enough to award curses or blessings upon the subordinates; the devotee of the Lord, even though he may not be a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> is more powerful than a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> But a powerful devotee never misuses the power for personal benefit.

<div class="First">Progressive human civilization is based on brahminical culture, God consciousness and protection of cows. All economic development of the state by trade, commerce, agriculture and industries must be fully utilized in relation to the above principles, otherwise all so-called economic development becomes a source of degradation. Cow protection means feeding the brahminical culture, which leads towards God consciousness, and thus perfection of human civilization is achieved. The age of Kali aims at killing the higher principles of life, and although Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it strongly resisted the domination of the personality of Kali within the world, the influence of the age of Kali came at an opportune moment, and even a strong king like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was induced to disregard the brahminical culture due to a slight provocation of hunger and thirst. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it lamented the accidental incident, and he desired that all his kingdom, strength and accumulation of wealth would be burned up for not being engaged in brahminical culture, etc.</div>
<div class="Purport">Where wealth and strength are not engaged in the advancement of brahminical culture, God consciousness and cow protection, the state and home are surely doomed by Providence.

<div class="Translation">While the King was thus repenting, he received news of his imminent death, which would be due to the bite of a snake-bird, occasioned by the curse spoken by the sage's son. The King accepted this as good news, for it would be the cause of his indifference toward worldly things.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Real happiness is achieved by spiritual existence or by cessation of the repetition of birth and death. One can stop the repetition of birth and death only by going back to Godhead. In the material world, even by attaining the topmost planet (Brahmaloka), one cannot get rid of the conditions of repeated birth and death, but still we do not accept the path of attaining perfection. The path of perfection frees one from all material attachments, and thus one becomes fit to enter into the spiritual kingdom. Therefore, those who are materially poverty-stricken are better candidates than those who are materially prosperous. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was a great devotee of the Lord and a bona fide candidate for entering into the kingdom of God, but even though he was so, his material assets as the Emperor of the world were setbacks to perfect attainment of his rightful status as one of the associates of the Lord in the spiritual sky. As a devotee of the Lord, he could understand that the cursing of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> boy, although unwise, was a blessing upon him, being the cause of detachment from worldly affairs, both political and social. &#346;am&#299;ka Muni also, after regretting the incident, conveyed the news to the King as a matter of duty so that the King would be able to prepare himself to go back to Godhead. &#346;am&#299;ka Muni sent news to the King that foolish &#346;&#7771;&#7749;gi, his son, although a powerful <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> boy, unfortunately had misused his spiritual power by cursing the King unwarrantedly. The incident of the King's garlanding the <span class="Italic">muni</span> was not sufficient cause for being cursed to death, but since there was no way to retract the curse, the King was informed to prepare for death within a week. Both &#346;am&#299;ka Muni and the King were self-realized souls. &#346;am&#299;ka Muni was a mystic, and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was a devotee. Therefore there was no difference between them in self-realization. Neither of them was afraid of meeting death. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it could have gone to the <span class="Italic">muni</span> to beg his pardon, but the news of imminent death was conveyed to the King with so much regret by the <span class="Italic">muni</span> that the King did not want to shame the <span class="Italic">muni</span> further by his presence there. He decided to prepare himself for his imminent death and find out the way to go back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purport">The life of a human being is a chance to prepare oneself to go back to Godhead, or to get rid of the material existence, the repetition of birth and death. Thus in the system of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> every man and woman is trained for this purpose. In other words, the system of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> is known also as <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana-dharma,</span> or the eternal occupation. The system of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> prepares a man for going back to Godhead, and thus a householder is ordered to go to the forest as <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha</span> to acquire complete knowledge and then to take <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> prior to his inevitable death. Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was fortunate to get a seven-day notice to meet his inevitable death. But for the common man there is no definite notice, although death is inevitable for all. Foolish men forget this sure fact of death and neglect the duty of preparing themselves for going back to Godhead. They spoil their lives in animal propensities to eat, drink, be merry and enjoy. Such an irresponsible life is adopted by the people in the age of Kali because of a sinful desire to condemn brahminical culture, God consciousness and cow protection, for which the state is responsible. The state must employ revenue to advance these three items and thus educate the populace to prepare for death. The state which does so is the real welfare state. The state of India should better follow the examples of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, the ideal executive head, than to imitate other materialistic states which have no idea of the kingdom of Godhead, the ultimate goal of human life. Deterioration of the ideals of Indian civilization has brought about the deterioration of civic life, not only in India but also abroad.</div>

<div class="Translation">The river [Ganges, by which the King sat to fast] carries the most auspicious water, which is mixed with the dust of the lotus feet of the Lord and tulas&#299; leaves. Therefore that water sanctifies the three worlds inside and outside and even sanctifies Lord &#346;iva and other demigods. Consequently everyone who is destined to die must take shelter of this river.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, just after receiving the news of his death within seven days, at once retired from family life and shifted himself to the sacred bank of the Yamun&#257; River. Generally it is said that the King took shelter on the bank of the Ganges, but according to &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;, the King took shelter on the bank of the Yamun&#257;. &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;'s statement appears to be more accurate because of the geographical situation. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it resided in his capital Hastin&#257;pura, situated near present Delhi, and the River Yamun&#257; flows down past the city. Naturally the King would take shelter of the River Yamun&#257; because she was flowing past his palace door. And as far as sanctity is concerned, the River Yamun&#257; is more directly connected with Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a than the Ganges. The Lord sanctified the River Yamun&#257; from the beginning of His transcendental pastimes in the world. While His father Vasudeva was crossing the Yamun&#257; with the baby Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a for a safe place at Gokula on the other bank of the river from Mathur&#257;, the Lord fell down in the river, and by the dust of His lotus feet the river at once became sanctified. It is especially mentioned herein that Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it took shelter of that particular river which is beautifully flowing, carrying the dust of the lotus feet of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, mixed with <span class="Italic">tulas&#299;</span> leaves. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's lotus feet are always besmeared with the <span class="Italic">tulas&#299;</span> leaves, and thus as soon as His lotus feet contact the water of the Ganges and the Yamun&#257;, the rivers become at once sanctified.

<div class="Verse-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">Thus the King, the worthy descendant of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, decided once and for all and sat on the Ganges' bank to fast until death and give himself up to the lotus feet of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who alone is able to award liberation. So, freeing himself from all kinds of associations and attachments, he accepted the vows of a sage.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The water of the Ganges sanctifies all the three worlds, including the gods and the demigods, because it emanates from the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the fountainhead of the principle of <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-tattva,</span> and therefore shelter of His lotus feet can deliver one from all sins, including an offense committed by a king unto a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, therefore, decided to meditate upon the lotus feet of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who is Mukunda, or the giver of liberations of all description. The banks of the Ganges or the Yamun&#257; give one a chance to remember the Lord continuously. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it freed himself from all sorts of material association and meditated upon the lotus feet of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and that is the way of liberation. To be free from all material association means to cease completely from committing any further sins. To meditate upon the lotus feet of the Lord means to become free from the effects of all previous sins. The conditions of the material world are so made that one has to commit sins willingly or unwillingly, and the best example is Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it himself, who was a recognized sinless, pious king. But he also became a victim of an offense, even though he was ever unwilling to commit such a mistake. He was cursed also, but because he was a great devotee of the Lord, even such reverses of life became favorable. The principle is that one should not willingly commit any sin in his life and should constantly remember the lotus feet of the Lord without deviation. Only in such a mood will the Lord help the devotee make regular progress toward the path of liberation and thus attain the lotus feet of the Lord. Even if there are accidental sins committed by the devotee, the Lord saves the surrendered soul from all sins, as confirmed in all scriptures.</div>

He was a great sage, and his very dear wife was Pulom&#257;. He could travel in space like Durv&#257;s&#257;, N&#257;rada and others, and he used to visit all the planets of the universe. Before the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra, he tried to stop the battle. Sometimes he instructed Bh&#257;radv&#257;ja Muni about astronomical evolution, and he is the author of the great <span class="Italic">Bh&#7771;gu-sa&#7745;hit&#257;,</span> the great astrological calculation. He explained how air, fire, water and earth are generated from ether. He explained how the air in the stomach works and regulates the intestines. As a great philosopher, he logically established the eternity of the living entity (<span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</span>). He was also a great anthropologist, and the theory of evolution was long ago explained by him. He was a scientific propounder of the four divisions and orders of human society known as the <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</span> institution. He converted the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> king V&#299;tahavya into a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span></div>

<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Par&#257;&#347;ara:</span> He is the grandson of Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha Muni and father of Vy&#257;sadeva. He is the son of Mahar&#7779;i &#346;akti, and his mother's name was Ad&#7771;&#347;yat&#299;. He was in the womb of his mother when she was only twelve years old. And from within the womb of his mother he learned the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> His father was killed by a demon, Kalm&#257;&#7779;ap&#257;da, and to avenge this he wanted to annihilate the whole world. He was restrained, however, by his grandfather Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha. He then performed a R&#257;k&#7779;asa-killing <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a,</span> but Mahar&#7779;i Pulastya restrained him. He begot Vy&#257;sadeva, being attracted by Satyavat&#299;, who was to become the wife of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#346;&#257;ntanu. By the blessings of Par&#257;&#347;ara, Satyavat&#299; became fragrant for miles. He was present also during the time of Bh&#299;&#7779;ma's death.

Although he was a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> by birth, he became a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> in the very same body by the power of his spiritual achievements. He picked a quarrel with Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha Muni when he was a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> king and performed a great sacrifice in cooperation with Maga&#7749;ga Muni and thus was able to vanquish the sons of Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha. He became a great <span class="Italic">yog&#299;,</span> and yet he failed to check his senses and thus was obliged to become the father of &#346;akuntal&#257;, the beauty queen of world history. Once, when he was a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> king, he visited the hermitage of Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha Muni, and he was given a royal reception. Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra wanted from Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha a cow named Nandin&#299;, and the Muni refused to deliver it. Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra stole the cow, and thus there was a quarrel between the sage and the King. Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra was defeated by the spiritual strength of Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha, and thus the King decided to become a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> Before becoming a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> he underwent severe austerity on the bank of the Kau&#347;ika.

Like the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas,</span> he also allowed his daughter to select her own husband in a <span class="Italic">svaya&#7745;vara</span> meeting, and at that ceremony all the bachelor sons of the <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is</span> were invited.

<div class="First">Although the King had already decided to fast until death on the bank of the Ganges, he humbly expressed his decision to elicit the opinions of the great authorities present there. Any decision, however important, should be confirmed by some authority. That makes the matter perfect. This means that the monarchs who ruled the earth in those days were not irresponsible dictators. They scrupulously followed the authoritative decisions of the saints and sages in terms of Vedic injunction. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, as a perfect king, followed the principles by consulting the authorities, even up to the last days of his life.</div>

<div class="Translation">The fortunate King said: Indeed, we are the most grateful of all the kings who are trained to get favors from the great souls. Generally you [sages] consider royalty as refuse to be rejected and left in a distant place.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">According to religious principles, stool, urine, wash water, etc., must be left at a long distance. Attached bathrooms, urinals, etc. may be very convenient amenities of modern civilization, but they are ordered to be situated at a distance from residential quarters. That very example is cited herein in relation to the kingly order for those who are progressively marching back to Godhead. Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu said that to be in intimate touch with dollars-and-cents men, or the kingly order, is worse than suicide for one who desires to go back to Godhead. In other words, the transcendentalists do not generally associate with men who are too enamored by the external beauty of God's creation. By advanced knowledge in spiritual realization, the transcendentalist knows that this beautiful material world is nothing but a shadowy reflection of the reality, the kingdom of God. They are not, therefore, very much captivated by royal opulence or anything like that. But in the case of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, the situation was different. Apparently the King was condemned to death by an inexperienced <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> boy, but factually he was called by the Lord to return to Him. Other transcendentalists, the great sages and mystics who assembled together because of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it's fasting unto death, were quite anxious to see him, for he was going back to Godhead. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it also could understand that the great sages who assembled there were all kind to his forefathers, the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, because of their devotional service to the Lord. He therefore felt grateful to the sages for being present there at the last stage of his life, and he felt that it was all due to the greatness of his late forefathers or grandfathers. He felt proud, therefore, that he happened to be the descendant of such great devotees. Such pride for the devotees of the Lord is certainly not equal to the puffed-up sense of vanity for material prosperity. The first is reality, whereas the other is false and vain.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">That a devotee of the Lord is the only perfect living being is explained herein by Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it. A devotee of the Lord is no one's enemy, although there may be many enemies of a devotee. A devotee of the Lord does not like to associate with nondevotees, although he has no enmity with them. He desires association with the devotees of the Lord. This is perfectly natural because birds of the same feather mix together. And the most important function of a devotee is to have complete attachment for Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the father of all living beings. As a good son of the father behaves in a friendly way with all his other brothers, so also the devotee of the Lord, being a good son of the supreme father, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, sees all other living beings in relation with the supreme father. He tries to bring back the upstart sons of the father to a saner stage and to get them to accept the supreme fatherhood of God. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was certainly going back to Godhead, but even if he were not to go back, he prayed for a pattern of life which is the most perfect way in the material world. A pure devotee does not desire the company of a personality as great as Brahm&#257;, but he prefers the association of a petty living being, provided he is a devotee of the Lord.</div>

It is not at all astonishing that you give up your throne, which is decorated with the helmets of many kings, to achieve eternal association with the Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Foolish politicians who hold political administrative posts think that the temporary posts they occupy are the highest material gain of life, and therefore they stick to those posts even up to the last moment of life, without knowing that achievement of liberation as one of the associates of the Lord in His eternal abode is the highest gain of life. The human life is meant for achieving this end. The Lord has assured us in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> many times that going back to Godhead, His eternal abode, is the highest achievement. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, while praying to Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;ha, said, "O my Lord, I am very much afraid of the materialistic way of life, and I am not the least afraid of Your present ghastly ferocious feature as N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva. This materialistic way of life is something like a grinding stone, and we are being crushed by it. We have fallen into this horrible whirlpool of the tossing waves of life, and thus, my Lord, I pray at Your lotus feet to call me back to Your eternal abode as one of Your servitors. This is the summit liberation of this materialistic way of life. I have very bitter experience of the materialistic way of life. In whichever species of life I have taken birth, compelled by the force of my own activities, I have very painfully experienced two things, namely separation from my beloved and meeting with what is not wanted. And to counteract them, the remedies which I undertook were more dangerous than the disease itself. So I drift from one point to another birth after birth, and I pray to You therefore to give me a shelter at Your lotus feet."</div>
<div class="Purport"><JD:"Destination-295">The P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ava kings, who are more than many saints of the world, knew the bitter results of the materialistic way of life. They were never captivated by the glare of the imperial throne they occupied, and they sought always the opportunity of being called by the Lord to associate with Him eternally. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was the worthy grandson of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira gave up the imperial throne to his grandson, and similarly Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, the grandson of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, gave up the imperial throne to his son Janamejaya. That is the way of all the kings in the dynasty because they are all strictly in the line of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Thus the devotees of the Lord are never enchanted by the glare of materialistic life, and they live impartially, unattached to the objects of the false, illusory materialistic way of life.</div>

<div class="First">Beyond the limitation of the material creation, which is compared to the cloud in the sky, there is the <span class="Italic">paravyoma,</span> or the spiritual sky, full of planets called Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;has.

When a great devotee of the Lord passes away, there is nothing to be lamented because the devotee is destined to enter into the kingdom of God. But the sorry plight is that such great devotees leave our sight, and therefore there is every reason to be sorry. As the Lord is rarely to be seen by our present eyes, so also are the great devotees. The great <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;is,</span> therefore, correctly decided to remain on the spot till the last moment.</div>

<div class="Translation">The King said: O great sages, you have all very kindly assembled here, having come from all parts of the universe. You are all as good as supreme knowledge personified, who resides in the planet above the three worlds [Satyaloka]. Consequently you are naturally inclined to do good to others, and but for this you have no interest, either in this life or in the next.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Six kinds of opulences, namely wealth, strength, fame, beauty, knowledge and renunciation, are all originally the different attributes pertaining to the Absolute Personality of Godhead. The living beings, who are part and parcel entities of the Supreme Being, have all these attributes partially, up to the full strength of seventy-eight percent. In the material world these attributes (up to seventy-eight percent of the Lord's attributes) are covered by the material energy, as the sun is covered by a cloud. The covered strength of the sun is very dim, compared to the original glare, and similarly the original color of the living beings with such attributes becomes almost extinct. There are three planetary systems, namely the lower worlds, the intermediate worlds and the upper worlds. The human beings on earth are situated at the beginning of the intermediate worlds, but living beings like Brahm&#257; and his contemporaries live in the upper worlds, of which the topmost is Satyaloka. In Satyaloka the inhabitants are fully cognizant of Vedic wisdom, and thus the mystic cloud of material energy is cleared. Therefore they are known as the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> personified. Such persons, being fully aware of knowledge both mundane and transcendental, have no interest in either the mundane or transcendental worlds. They are practically desireless devotees. In the mundane world they have nothing to achieve, and in the transcendental world they are full in themselves. Then why do they come to the mundane world? They descend on different planets as messiahs by the order of the Lord to deliver the fallen souls. On the earth they come down and do good to the people of the world in different circumstances under different climatic influences. They have nothing to do in this world save and except reclaim the fallen souls rotting in material existence, deluded by material energy.</div>

<div class="Translation">O trustworthy br&#257;hma&#7751;as, I now ask you about my immediate duty. Please, after proper deliberation, tell me of the unalloyed duty of everyone in all circumstances, and specifically of those who are just about to die.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">In this verse the King has placed two questions before the learned sages. The first question is what is the duty of everyone in all circumstances, and the second question is what is the specific duty of one who is to die very shortly. Out of the two, the question relating to the dying man is most important because everyone is a dying man, either very shortly or after one hundred years. The duration of life is immaterial, but the duty of a dying man is very important. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it placed these two questions before &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; also on his arrival, and practically the whole of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> beginning from the Second Canto up to the last Twelfth Canto, deals with these two questions. The conclusion arrived at thereof is that devotional service of the Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, as it is confirmed by the Lord Himself in the last phases of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> is the last word in relation to everyone's permanent duty in life. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was already aware of this fact, but he wanted the great sages assembled there to unanimously give their verdict on his conviction so that he might be able to go on with his confirmed duty without controversy. He has especially mentioned the word <span class="Italic">&#347;uddha,</span> or perfectly correct. For transcendental realization or self-realization, many processes are recommended by various classes of philosophers. Some of them are first-class methods, and some of them are second- or third-class methods. The first-class method demands that one give up all other methods and surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord and thus be saved from all sins and their reactions.</div>

<div class="Translation">At that moment there appeared the powerful son of Vy&#257;sadeva, who traveled over the earth disinterested and satisfied with himself. He did not manifest any symptoms of belonging to any social order or status of life. He was surrounded with women and children, and he dressed as if others had neglected him.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">The word <span class="Italic">bhagav&#257;n</span> is sometimes used in relation with some of the great devotees of the Lord, like &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;. Such liberated souls are disinterested in the affairs of this material world because they are self-satisfied by the great achievements of devotional service. As explained before, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; never accepted any formal spiritual master, nor did he undergo any formal reformatory performances. His father, Vy&#257;sadeva, was his natural spiritual master because &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; heard <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> from him. After this, he became completely self-satisfied. Thus he was not dependent on any formal process. The formal processes are necessary for those who are expected to reach the stage of complete liberation, but &#346;r&#299; &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was already in that status by the grace of his father. As a young boy he was expected to be properly dressed, but he went about naked and was uninterested in social customs. He was neglected by the general populace, and inquisitive boys and women surrounded him as if he were a madman. He thus appears on the scene while traveling on the earth of his own accord. It appears that upon the inquiry of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, the great sages were not unanimous in their decision as to what was to be done. For spiritual salvation there were many prescriptions according to the different modes of different persons. But the ultimate aim of life is to attain the highest perfectional stage of devotional service to the Lord. As doctors differ, so also sages differ in their different prescriptions. While such things were going on, the great and powerful son of Vy&#257;sadeva appeared on the scene.</div>

One who does not know how to put questions before the spiritual master has no business seeing him.

<div class="First">The importance of holy places of pilgrimage is due to the presence of great sages and saints. It is said that sinful persons go to the holy places and leave their sins there to accumulate. But the presence of the great saints disinfects the accumulated sins, and thus the holy places continue to remain sanctified by the grace of the devotees and saints present there. If such saints appear in the homes of worldly people, certainly the accumulated sins of such worldly enjoyers become neutralized. Therefore, the holy saints actually have no self-interest with the householders. The only aim of such saints is to sanctify the houses of the householders, and the householders therefore should feel grateful when such saints and sages appear at their doors. A householder who dishonors such holy orders is a great offender. It is enjoined, therefore, that a householder who does not bow down before a saint at once must undergo fasting for the day in order to neutralize the great offense.</div>

<div class="First">There are two classes of human beings, namely the atheist and the devotee of the Lord. The devotee of the Lord, because of manifesting godly qualities, is called a demigod, whereas the atheist is called a demon. The demon cannot stand the presence of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Personality of Godhead. The demons are always busy in trying to vanquish the Personality of Godhead, but factually as soon as the Personality of Godhead appears, by either His transcendental name, form, attributes, pastimes, paraphernalia or variegatedness, the demon is at once vanquished. It is said that a ghost cannot remain as soon as the holy name of the Lord is chanted. The great saints and devotees of the Lord are in the list of His paraphernalia, and thus as soon as a saintly devotee is present, the ghostly sins are at once vanquished. That is the verdict of all Vedic literatures. One is recommended, therefore, to associate only with saintly devotees so that worldly demons and ghosts cannot exert their sinister influence.</div>

<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">A pure and exclusive devotee of the Lord serves his family interest more dexterously than others, who are attached to illusory family affairs. Generally people are attached to family matters, and the whole economic impetus of human society is moving under the influence of family affection. Such deluded persons have no information that one can render better service to the family by becoming a devotee of the Lord. The Lord gives special protection to the family members and descendants of a devotee, even though such members are themselves nondevotees! Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Prahl&#257;da was a great devotee of the Lord, but his father, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, was a great atheist and declared enemy of the Lord. But despite all this, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was awarded salvation due to his being the father of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Prahl&#257;da. The Lord is so kind that he gives all protection to the family members of His devotee, and thus the devotee has no need to bother about his family members, even if one leaves such family members aside to discharge devotional service. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira and his brothers were the sons of Kunt&#299;, the paternal aunt of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it admits the patronage of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a because of his being the only grandson of the great P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas.</div>

<div class="First">The great sage &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was certainly inspired by Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a to appear voluntarily before Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, the great devotee of the Lord, just to give him the teachings of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> One can achieve the nucleus of the devotional service of the Lord by the mercy of the spiritual master and the Personality of Godhead.

One who is not authorized by the Lord cannot become a spiritual master. &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; is an authorized spiritual master, and thus he was inspired by the Lord to appear before Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it and instruct him in the teachings of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> One can achieve the ultimate success of going back to Godhead if he is favored by the Lord's sending His true representative. As soon as a true representative of the Lord is met by a devotee of the Lord, the devotee is assured a guarantee for going back to Godhead just after leaving the present body. This, however, depends on the sincerity of the devotee himself. The Lord is seated in the heart of all living beings, and thus he knows very well the movements of all individual persons. As soon as the Lord finds that a particular soul is very eager to go back to Godhead, the Lord at once sends His bona fide representative. The sincere devotee is thus assured by the Lord of going back to Godhead. The conclusion is that to get the assistance and help of a bona fide spiritual master means <span class="Italic">to receive the direct help of the Lord Himself.</span></div>

<div class="Translation">You are the spiritual master of great saints and devotees. I am therefore begging you to show the way of perfection for all persons, and especially for one who is about to die.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Unless one is perfectly anxious to inquire about the way of perfection, there is no necessity of approaching a spiritual master. A spiritual master is not a kind of decoration for a householder. Generally a fashionable materialist engages a so-called spiritual master without any profit. The pseudo- spiritual master flatters the so-called disciple, and thereby both the master and his ward go to hell without a doubt. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it is the right type of disciple because he puts forward questions vital to the interest of all men, particularly for the dying men. The question put forward by Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it is the basic principle of the complete thesis of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> Now let us see how intelligently the great master replies.</div>

<div class="Translation">O powerful br&#257;hma&#7751;a, it is said that you hardly stay in the houses of men long enough to milk a cow.</div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="First">Saints and sages in the renounced order of life go to the houses of the householders at the time they milk the cows, early in the morning, and ask some quantity of milk for subsistence. A pound of milk fresh from the milk bag of a cow is sufficient to feed an adult with all vitamin values, and therefore saints and sages live only on milk. Even the poorest of the householders keep at least ten cows, each delivering twelve to twenty quarts of milk, and therefore no one hesitates to spare a few pounds of milk for the mendicants. It is the duty of householders to maintain the saints and sages, like the children. So a saint like &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; would hardly stay at the house of a householder for more than five minutes in the morning. In other words, such saints are very rarely seen in the houses of householders, and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it therefore prayed to him to instruct him as soon as possible. The householders also should be intelligent enough to get some transcendental information from visiting sages. The householder should not foolishly ask a saint to deliver what is available in the market. That should be the reciprocal relation between the saints and the householders.</div>
