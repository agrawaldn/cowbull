King Priyavrata was detached from worldly opulence, and then he became attached to his kingdom, but finally he again became detached from material enjoyment and thus achieved liberation. When King Par&#299;k&#7779;it heard about this, he was struck with wonder, but he was somewhat bewildered as to how a devotee with no attachment for material enjoyment could later become attached to it. Thus in astonishment he questioned &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; about this.</div></div><A NAME="66572"></A><div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level"><TB>In response to the King&rsquo;s inquiries, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; said that devotional service, being transcendental, cannot be deviated by any material influences. Priyavrata had received transcendental knowledge from the instructions of N&#257;rada, and therefore he did not want to enter a materialistic life of enjoyment in a kingdom. He accepted the kingdom, however, at the request of such superior demigods as Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord Indra, the King of heaven.</div></div><A NAME="66573"></A><div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level"><TB>Everything is under the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the supreme controller, and everyone must work accordingly. Just as a bull is controlled by a rope tied to its nose, so all conditioned souls are forced to work under the spells of the modes of nature. A civilized man, therefore, works according to the institution of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama.</span> Even in materialistic life, however, no one is free to act. Everyone is compelled to accept a certain type of body offered by the Supreme Lord and thus be allotted different grades of happiness and distress. Therefore even if one artificially leaves home and goes to the forest, he again becomes attached to materialistic life. Family life is compared to a fortress for practicing sense control. When the senses are controlled. one may live either at home or in the forest; there is no difference.</div></div><A NAME="66574"></A><div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level"><TB>When Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata, following the instruction of Lord Brahm&#257;. accepted the royal throne, his father, Manu, left home for the forest. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata then married Barhi&#7779;mat&#299;, the daughter of Vi&#347;vakarm&#257;. In the womb of Barhi&#7779;mat&#299; he begot ten sons, named &#256;gn&#299;dhra, Idhmajihva, Yaj&ntilde;ab&#257;hu, Mah&#257;v&#299;ra, Hira&#7751;yaret&#257;, Gh&#7771;tap&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;ha, Savana, Medh&#257;tithi, V&#299;tihotra and Kavi. He also begot one daughter, whose name was &#362;rjasvat&#299;. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata lived with his wife and family for many thousands of years. The impressions from the rims of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata&rsquo;s chariot wheels created seven oceans and seven islands. Of the ten sons of Priyavrata, three sons named Kavi, Mah&#257;v&#299;ra and Savana accepted <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa,</span> the fourth order of life, and the remaining seven sons became the rulers of the seven islands. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata also had a second wife, in whom he begot three sons named Uttama, Raivata and T&#257;masa. All of them were elevated to the post of Manu. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; thus described how Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata achieved liberation.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The mission of human life is to realize one&rsquo;s self and then gradually to go back home, back to Godhead. Since N&#257;rada Muni instructed the King fully on this subject, why did he again enter household life, which is the main cause of material bondage? Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was greatly astonished that King Priyavrata remained in household life, especially since he was not only a self-realized soul but also a first-class devotee of the Lord. A devotee actually has no attraction for household life, but surprisingly, King Priyavrata enjoyed household life very much. One may argue, &ldquo;Why is it wrong to enjoy household life?&rdquo; The reply is that in household life one becomes bound by the results of fruitive activities. The essence of household life is sense enjoyment, and as long as one engrosses his mind in working hard for sense enjoyment, one becomes bound by the reactions of fruitive activities. This ignorance of self-realization is the greatest defeat in human life. The human form of life is especially meant for getting out of the bondage of fruitive activities, but as long as one is forgetful of his life&rsquo;s mission and acts like an ordinary animal&mdash;eating, sleeping, mating and defending&mdash;he must continue his conditioned life of material existence. Such a life is called <span class="Italic">svar&#363;pa-vism&#7771;ti,</span> forgetfulness of one&rsquo;s real constitutional position. Therefore in Vedic civilization one is trained in the very beginning of life as a <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;.</span> A <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> must execute austerities and refrain from sex indulgence. Therefore if one is completely trained in the principles of <span class="Italic">brahmacarya,</span> he generally does not enter household life. He is then called a <span class="Italic">nai&#7779;&#7789;hika-brahmac&#257;r&#299;,</span> which indicates total celibacy. King Par&#299;k&#7779;it was thus astonished that the great King Priyavrata, although trained in the principles of <span class="Italic">nai&#7779;&#7789;hika-brahmacarya,</span> entered household life.</div><A NAME="66590"></A><div class="Purport">The words <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavata &#257;tm&#257;r&#257;ma&#7717;</span> are very significant in this verse. If one is self-satisfied as is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is called <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavata &#257;tm&#257;r&#257;ma&#7717;.</span> There are different types of satisfaction. <span class="Italic">Karm&#299;s</span> are satisfied in their fruitive activities, <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s</span> are satisfied to merge into the effulgence of Brahman, and devotees are satisfied to engage in the Lord&rsquo;s service. The Lord is self-satisfied because He is fully opulent, and one who is satisfied by serving Him is called <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavata &#257;tm&#257;r&#257;ma&#7717;.</span> <span class="Italic">Manu&#7779;y&#257;&#7751;&#257;&#7745; sahasre&#7779;u: [Bg. <a href="index7428.html?g=2487">7.3</a>]</span> out of many thousands of persons, one may endeavor for liberation, and of many thousands of persons attempting to become liberated, one may achieve liberation from the anxieties of material existence and become self-satisfied. Even that satisfaction, however, is not the ultimate satisfaction. The <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s</span> and the <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> have desires, as do the <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s,</span> but devotees have no desires. Satisfaction in the service of the Lord is called <span class="Italic">ak&#257;ma,</span> freedom from desire, and this is the ultimate satisfaction. Therefore Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it inquired, &ldquo;How could one who was fully satisfied on the highest platform be satisfied with family life?&rdquo;</div><A NAME="66591"></A><div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">par&#257;bhava&#7717;</span> in this verse is also significant. When one is satisfied in family life, he is doomed because he must already have forgotten his relationship with the Lord. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja describes how the activities of family life implicate one more and more. <span class="Italic">&#256;tma-p&#257;ta&#7745; g&#7771;ham andha-k&#363;pam:</span> household life is like a dark well. If one falls into this well, his spiritual death is assured. How Priyavrata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja remained a liberated <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa</span> even within family life is described in the next verse.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is praised in eloquent, transcendental verses by such exalted personalities as Brahm&#257;, are very pleasing to great devotees and liberated persons. One who is attached to the nectarean honey of the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet, and whose mind is always absorbed in His glories, may sometimes be checked by some impediment, but he still never gives up the exalted position he has acquired.</div><A NAME="66646"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="66647"></A><div class="First">&#346;r&#299; &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; accepted both of the King&rsquo;s propositions&mdash;that a person who is advanced in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness cannot embrace materialistic life again and that one who has embraced materialistic life cannot take up K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness at any stage of his existence. Although accepting both these statements, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; qualified them by saying that a person who has once absorbed his mind in the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead may sometimes be influenced by impediments, but he still does not give up his exalted devotional position.</div><A NAME="66648"></A><div class="Purport">According to &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura, there are two kinds of impediments to devotional service. The first is an offense at the lotus feet of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. This is called <span class="Italic">vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-apar&#257;dha.</span> &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu warned His devotees not to commit <span class="Italic">vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-apar&#257;dha,</span> which He described as the mad elephant offense. When a mad elephant enters a beautiful garden, it destroys everything, leaving a barren field. Similarly, the power of <span class="Italic">vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-apar&#257;dha</span> is so great that even an advanced devotee becomes almost devoid of his spiritual assets if he commits it. Since K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness is eternal, it cannot be destroyed altogether, but advancement may be checked for the time being. Thus <span class="Italic">vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-apar&#257;dha</span> is one kind of impediment to devotional service. Sometimes, however, the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His devotee desires to impede one&rsquo;s devotional service. For example, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu and Hira&#7751;y&#257;k&#7779;a were formerly Jaya and Vijaya, the gatekeepers in Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha, but by the desire of the Lord, they became His enemies for three lives. Thus the desire of the Lord is another kind of impediment. But in both cases, the pure devotee, once advanced in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, cannot be lost. Following the orders of his superiors (Sv&#257;yambhuva and Lord Brahm&#257;), Priyavrata accepted family life, but this did not mean he lost his position in devotional service. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness is perfect and eternal, and therefore it cannot be lost under any circumstances. Because the material world is full of obstructions to advancement in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, there may appear to be many impediments, yet K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, declares in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexa9e1.html?g=3264">9.31</a>), <span class="Italic">kaunteya pratij&#257;n&#299;hi na me bhakta&#7717; pra&#7751;a&#347;yati:</span> once one has taken shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord, he cannot be lost.</div><A NAME="66649"></A><div class="Purport">In this verse, the word <span class="Italic">&#347;ivatam&#257;m</span> is very significant. <span class="Italic">&#346;ivatam&#257;m</span> means &ldquo;the most auspicious.&rdquo; The devotional path is so auspicious that a devotee cannot be lost under any circumstances. This is described in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> by the Lord Himself. <span class="Italic">p&#257;rtha naiveha n&#257;mutra vin&#257;&#347;as tasya vidyate:</span> &ldquo;My dear Arjuna, for a devotee there is no question of being lost, either in this life or in the next.&rdquo; (Bg. <a href="indexf336-3.html?g=2394">6.40</a>) In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexa603.html?g=2422">6.43</a>) the Lord clearly explains how this is so.</div><A NAME="66650"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">tatra ta&#7745; buddhi-sa&#7745;yoga&#7745;<br>labhate paurva-dehikam<br>yatate ca tato bh&#363;ya&#7717;<br>sa&#7745;siddhau kuru-nandana</div></div><A NAME="66651"></A><div class="After-Verse">By the order of the Lord, a perfect devotee sometimes comes to this material world like an ordinary human being. Because of his previous practice, such a perfect devotee naturally becomes attached to devotional service, apparently without cause. Despite all kinds of impediments due to surrounding circumstances, he automatically perseveres in devotional service and gradually advances until he once again becomes perfect. Bilvama&#7749;gala &#7788;h&#257;kura had been an advanced devotee in his previous life, but in his next life he became greatly fallen and was attached to a prostitute. Suddenly, however, his entire behavior was changed by the words of the very prostitute who had so much attracted him, and he became a great devotee. In the lives of exalted devotees, there are many such instances, proving that once one has taken to the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord, he cannot be lost (<span class="Italic">kaunteya pratij&#257;n&#299;hi na me bhakta&#7717; pra&#7751;a&#347;yati</span>).</div><A NAME="66652"></A><div class="Purport">The fact is, however, that one becomes a devotee when he is completely freed from all reactions to sinful life.

continued: My dear King, Prince Priyavrata was a great devotee because he sought the lotus feet of N&#257;rada, his spiritual master, and thus achieved the highest perfection in transcendental knowledge. With advanced knowledge, he always engaged in discussing spiritual subjects and did not divert his attention to anything else. The Prince&rsquo;s father then asked him to take charge of ruling the world. He tried to convince Priyavrata that this was his duty as indicated in the revealed scriptures. Prince Priyavrata, however, was continuously practicing bhakti-yoga by constantly remembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead, thus engaging all his senses in the service of the Lord. Therefore, although the order of his father could not be rejected, the Prince did not welcome it. Thus he very conscientiously raised the question of whether he might be diverted from devotional service by accepting the responsibility of ruling over the world.</div><A NAME="66667"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="66668"></A><div class="First">&#346;r&#299;la Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura has sung, <span class="Italic">ch&#257;&#7693;iy&#257; vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-sev&#257; nist&#257;ra p&#257;yeche keb&#257;:</span> &ldquo;Without serving the lotus feet of a pure Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava or spiritual master, no one has ever attained perfect liberation from material bondage.&rdquo; prince Priyavrata regularly served the lotus feet of N&#257;rada, and thus the Prince perfectly understood transcendental subjects in truth (<span class="Italic">sa-tattva&#7717;</span>). The word <span class="Italic">sa-tattva&#7717;</span> means that Priyavrata knew all the facts about the spirit soul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the relationship between the spirit soul and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he also knew all about this material world and the relationship of the spirit soul and the Supreme Lord within the material world. Thus the Prince decided to engage himself only in rendering service to the Lord.</div><A NAME="66669"></A><div class="Purport">When Priyavrata&rsquo;s father, Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu, requested him to accept the responsibility of ruling over the world, he did not welcome the suggestion. This is the symptom of a great, liberated devotee. Even though engaged in worldly affairs, he does not take pleasure in them, but remains always absorbed in the Lord&rsquo;s service. While thus serving the Lord, he deals externally with worldly affairs without being affected. For example, although he has no attraction for his children, he cares for them and educates them to become devotees. Similarly, he speaks to his wife with affectionate words, but he is not attached to her. By rendering devotional service, a devotee acquires all the good qualities of the Supreme Lord. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a had sixteen thousand wives, all of them very beautiful, and although He dealt with each of them as a beloved husband, He was not attracted or attached to any of them. In the same way, although a devotee may enter family life and act very affectionately toward his wife and children, he is never attached to these activities.</div><A NAME="66670"></A><div class="Purport">This verse states that by serving the lotus feet of his spiritual master, prince Priyavrata very soon attained the perfectional stage of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness.

Born directly from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he dedicates his activities to the welfare of the entire universe, for he knows the purpose of the universal creation. This supremely powerful Lord Brahm&#257;, accompanied by his associates and the personified Vedas, left his own abode in the highest planetary system and descended to the place of Prince Priyavrata&rsquo;s meditation.</div><A NAME="66688"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="66689"></A><div class="First">Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Supreme Self (<span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;</span>), is the source of everything, as explained in the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra:</span> <span class="Italic">janm&#257;dy asya yata&#7717;</I> [SB </I><a href="index4dab.html?g=6120">1.1.1</a></I>]</I>.</span> Because Brahm&#257; was born directly from Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, he is called <span class="Italic">&#257;tma-yoni.</span> He is also called <span class="Italic">bhagav&#257;n,</span> although generally <span class="Italic">bhagav&#257;n</span> refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead (Vi&#7779;&#7751;u or Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a). Sometimes great personalities&mdash;such as demigods like Lord Brahm&#257;, N&#257;rada or Lord &#346;iva&mdash;are also addressed as <span class="Italic">bhagav&#257;n</span> because they carry out the purpose of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Brahm&#257; is called <span class="Italic">bhagav&#257;n</span> because he is the secondary creator of this universe. He is always thinking of how to improve the situation of the conditioned souls who have come to the material world to enjoy material activities. For this reason, he disseminates the Vedic knowledge throughout the universe for everyone&rsquo;s guidance.</div><A NAME="66690"></A><div class="Purport">Vedic knowledge is divided into two parts: <span class="Italic">prav&#7771;tti-m&#257;rga</span> and <span class="Italic">niv&#7771;tti-m&#257;rga.</span> <span class="Italic">Niv&#7771;tti-m&#257;rga</span> is the path of negating sense enjoyment, and <span class="Italic">prav&#7771;tti-m&#257;rga</span> is the path by which the living entities are given a chance to enjoy and at the same time are directed in such a way that they can go back home, back to Godhead. Because ruling over this universe is a great responsibility, Brahm&#257; must force many Manus in different ages to take charge of universal affairs. Under each Manu there are different kings who also execute the purpose of Lord Brahm&#257;. It is understood from previous explanations that the father of Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, King Utt&#257;nap&#257;da, ruled over the universe because his elder brother, Priyavrata, practiced austerity from the very beginning of his life. Thus up to the point of the Pracet&#257;s, the kings of the universe were all descendants of Utt&#257;nap&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. Since there were no suitable kings after the Pracet&#257;s, Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu went to the Gandham&#257;dana Hill to bring back his eldest son, Priyavrata, who was meditating there. Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu requested Priyavrata to rule over the universe. When he refused, Lord Brahm&#257; descended from the supreme planetary system, known as Satyaloka, to request Priyavrata to accept the order. Lord Brahm&#257; did not come alone. He came with other great sages like Mar&#299;ci, &#256;treya and Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha. To convince Priyavrata that it was necessary for him to follow the Vedic injunctions and accept the responsibility of ruling over the world, Lord Brahm&#257; also brought with him the personified <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> his constant associates.</div><A NAME="66691"></A><div class="Purport">A significant word in this verse is <span class="Italic">sva-bhavan&#257;t,</span> indicating that Lord Brahm&#257; descended from his own abode. Every demigod has his own abode. Indra, the King of the demigods, has his own abode, as do Candra, the lord of the moon planet, and S&#363;rya, the predominating deity of the sun planet.

A material body includes senses. However, the sense activities of so-called scientists who try to be free from God&rsquo;s law or the laws of nature are useless. This is also confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexd990.html?g=2586">7.14</a>). <span class="Italic">Mama m&#257;y&#257; duratyay&#257;:</span> it is impossible to surpass the control of material nature, for the Supreme Personality of Godhead is working behind it.

Priyavrata might argue that Lord Brahm&#257; was requesting him to accept family life and the responsibility for ruling a kingdom, although N&#257;rada Muni had advised him not to enter household life and be entangled in material affairs. Whom to accept would be a puzzle for Priyavrata because both Lord Brahm&#257; and N&#257;rada Muni are authorities. Under the circumstances, the use of the word <span class="Italic">man&#299;&#7779;ay&#257;</span> is very appropriate, for it indicates that since both N&#257;rada Muni and Lord Brahm&#257; are authorized to give instruction, Priyavrata should neglect neither of them but should use his intelligence to follow the advice of both. To solve such dilemmas, &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; has given a very clear conception of intelligence. He says:</div><A NAME="66761"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">an&#257;saktasya vi&#7779;ay&#257;n<br>yath&#257;rham upayu&ntilde;jata&#7717;<br>nirbandha&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-sambandhe<br>yukta&#7745; vair&#257;gyam ucyate</div></div><A NAME="66762"></A><div class="After-Verse"><span class="Italic">Vi&#7779;ay&#257;n,</span> material affairs, should be accepted without attachment. and everything should be dovetailed with the service of the Lord.

Becoming a family man or king in the material world is not harmful if one accepts everything for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s service. That necessitates clear intelligence. M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers say, <span class="Italic">brahma satya&#7745; jagan mithy&#257;:</span> this material world is false, and only the Absolute Truth is real. However, an intelligent devotee in the line of Lord Brahm&#257; and the great sage N&#257;rada&mdash;or, in other words, in the Brahma-samprad&#257;ya&mdash;does not consider this world false. That which is created by the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be false, but using it for enjoyment is. Everything is meant to be enjoyed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index2ceb.html?g=2055">5.29</a>). <span class="Italic">Bhokt&#257;ra&#7745; yaj&ntilde;a-tapas&#257;&#7745; sarva-loka-mahe&#347;varam:</span> the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme proprietor and enjoyer, and therefore everything should be dovetailed for His enjoyment and service.

Others say, however, that one&rsquo;s birth according to the <span class="Italic">gu&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">karma</span> of his past life is not the essential consideration, since one can change his <span class="Italic">gu&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">karma</span> even in this life. Thus they say that the four divisions of the social order&mdash;<span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a, k&#7779;atriya, vai&#347;ya</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span>&mdash;should be arranged according to the <span class="Italic">gu&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">karma</span> of this life. This version is confirmed in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> by N&#257;rada Muni. While instructing Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira about the symptoms of <span class="Italic">gu&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">karma,</span> N&#257;rada Muni said that these symptoms must govern the division of society. In other words, if a person born in the family of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> has the symptoms of a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra,</span> he should be designated as a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra.</span> Similarly, if a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> has brahminical qualities, he should be designated a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span></div><A NAME="66793"></A><div class="Purport">The <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</span> system is scientific. Therefore if we accept the divisions of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama</span> according to the Vedic instructions, our lives will be successful. Unless human society is thus divided and arranged, it cannot be perfect.

At the present moment, however, human society does not know that this is the ultimate goal or perfection of life. Therefore instead of worshiping Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. people have been educated to worship matter. According to the direction of modern society, men think they can advance in civilization by manipulating matter to build skyscrapers, big roads, automobiles and so on. Such a civilization must certainly be called materialistic because its people do not know the goal of life. The goal of life is to reach Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. but instead of reaching Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, people are bewildered by the external manifestation of the material energy. Therefore progress in material advancement is blind, and the leaders of such material advancement are also blind. They are leading their followers in the wrong way.</div><A NAME="66796"></A><div class="Purport">It is best, therefore, to accept the injunctions of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> which are mentioned in this verse as <span class="Italic">yad-v&#257;ci.</span> In accordance with those injunctions, everyone should find out whether he is a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a, k&#7779;atriya, vai&#347;ya</span> or <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> and should thus be educated accordingly. Then his life will be successful. Otherwise, all of human society will be confused. If human society is divided scientifically according to <span class="Italic">var&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama,</span> and if the Vedic directions are followed, one&rsquo;s life, regardless of his position, will be successful. It is not that <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> will be elevated to the transcendental platform but not the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras.</span> If the Vedic injunctions are followed, all of them&mdash;<span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as, k&#7779;atriyas, vai&#347;yas</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span>&mdash;will be elevated to the transcendental platform, and their lives will be successful. The injunctions in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are explicit directions from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The example cited in this verse is that bulls tied by ropes in their nostrils move according to the direction of the driver. Similarly, if we move according to the instructions of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> the perfect paths for our lives will be set. Otherwise, if we do not move in that way but act according to our whimsical ideas, our lives will be spoiled by confusion and will end in despair. Actually, because people at the present moment are not following the instructions of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> they are all confused. We must therefore accept this instruction by Lord Brahm&#257; to Priyavrata as the factual scientific direction leading to the success of life.

This we cannot change, for the happiness and distress are ordained by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in accordance with whose decision we have received our bodies. Since we cannot avoid the plan of the Supreme Godhead, we must agree to be directed by Him, just as a blind man is led by a person who has eyes. Under any circumstances, if we remain in the condition allotted to us by the Supreme Lord and follow His instructions, we will become perfect. The main purpose of life is to follow the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is such instructions that constitute one&rsquo;s religion or occupational duty.</div><A NAME="66813"></A><div class="Purport">In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> therefore, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharm&#257;n parityajya m&#257;m eka&#7745; &#347;ara&#7751;a&#7745; vraja:</span> &ldquo;Give up all other engagements.

The bulls, being completely surrendered to the driver, remain wherever he wants to place them and eat whatever he wants them to eat. Similarly, being completely surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we should not aspire for happiness, or regret distress; we must be satisfied with the position allotted to us by the Lord. We should follow the path of devotional service and not be dissatisfied with the happiness and distress He has given. People in the material modes of passion and ignorance generally cannot understand the plan of the Supreme Personality of Godhead with its 8,400,000 forms of life, but the human form affords one the special privilege to understand this plan, engage in devotional service and elevate oneself to the highest position of perfection by following the Lord&rsquo;s instructions. The entire world is working under the influence of the modes of material nature, especially ignorance and passion, but if people engage in hearing and chanting about the glories of the Supreme Lord, their lives can be successful, and they can be elevated to the highest perfection. In the <span class="Italic">B&#7771;han-n&#257;rad&#299;ya Pur&#257;&#7751;a,</span> therefore, it is said:</div><A NAME="66817"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">harer n&#257;ma harer n&#257;ma<br>harer n&#257;maiva kevalam<br>kalau n&#257;sty eva n&#257;sty eva<br>n&#257;sty eva gatir anyath&#257;<br></I> [Adi </I><a href="indexd751.html?g=93741">17.21</a></I>]</I></div></div><A NAME="66818"></A><div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;In this age of Kali, there is no other way, no other way, no other way for spiritual perfection than the holy name, the holy name, the holy name of the Lord.&rdquo; Everyone should be given the chance to hear the holy names of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for thus one will gradually come to understand his real position in life and be elevated to the transcendental position above the mode of goodness. Thus all impediments to his progress will be cut to pieces. In conclusion, therefore, we must be satisfied in whatever position we have been put into by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and we should try to engage ourselves in His devotional service. Then our lives will be successful.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

To answer this doubt, Lord Brahm&#257; informed him that even those who are liberated do not resent accepting, in the present body, the results of their past activities. While sleeping, one dreams many unreal things, but when he awakens he disregards them and makes progress in factual life. Similarly, a liberated person&mdash;one who has completely understood that he is not the body but a spirit soul&mdash;disregards past activities performed in ignorance and performs his present activities in such a way that they produce no reactions.

Formerly many mercantile men from the up-country of India used to go to Bengal, and thus there is a familiar saying, &ldquo;If you go to Bengal, your fortune will go with you.&rdquo; Our first concern, therefore, should be to control the senses, and since the senses cannot be controlled unless engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, our most important duty is to engage the senses in devotional service. <span class="Italic">H&#7771;&#7779;&#299;ke&#7751;a h&#7771;&#7779;&#299;ke&#347;a-sevana&#7745; bhaktir ucyate:</span></I> [Cc.

Even household life can do no harm to a self-controlled person acting in this way; it cannot force him into material bondage. &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; has further enunciated this position:</div><A NAME="66850"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">&#299;h&#257; yasya harer d&#257;sye<br>karma&#7751;&#257; manas&#257; gir&#257;<br>nikhil&#257;sv apy avasth&#257;su<br>j&#299;van-mukta&#7717; sa ucyate</div></div><A NAME="66851"></A><div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Regardless of one&rsquo;s circumstances, if one fully engages his activities, mind and words in the devotional service of the Lord, he should be understood to be a liberated person.&rdquo; &#346;r&#299;la Bhaktivinoda &#7788;h&#257;kura was a responsible officer and a householder, yet his service to the cause of expanding the mission of Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu is unique. &#346;r&#299;la Prabodh&#257;nanda Sarasvat&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura says, <span class="Italic">durd&#257;ntendriya-k&#257;la-sarpa-pa&#7789;al&#299; protkh&#257;ta-da&#7745;&#7779;&#7789;r&#257;yate.</span> The sense organs are certainly our greatest enemies, and they are therefore compared to venomous serpents. However, if a venomous serpent is bereft of its poison fangs, it is no longer fearful. Similarly, if the senses are engaged in the service of the Lord, there is no need to fear their activities. The devotees in the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement move within this material world, but because their senses are fully engaged in the service of the Lord, they are always aloof from the material world. They are always living in a transcendental position.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

With the permission of the great sage N&#257;rada, he delivered to his son the governmental responsibility for maintaining and protecting all the planets of the universe. He thus achieved relief from the most dangerous, poisonous ocean of material desires.</div><A NAME="66920"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="66921"></A><div class="First">Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu was practically hopeless because such a great personality as N&#257;rada was instructing his son Priyavrata not to accept household life. Now he was very pleased that Lord Brahm&#257; had interfered by inducing his son to accept the responsibility for ruling the government of the universe. From <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> we get information that Vaivasvata Manu was the son of the sun-god and that his son, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ik&#7779;v&#257;ku, ruled this planet earth. Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu, however, appears to have been in charge of the entire universe, and he entrusted to his son, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata, the responsibility for maintaining and protecting all the planetary systems. <span class="Italic">Dhar&#257;-ma&#7751;&#7693;ala</span> means &ldquo;planet.&rdquo; This earth, for instance, is called <span class="Italic">dhar&#257;-ma&#7751;&#7693;ala.</span> <span class="Italic">Akhila,</span> however, means &ldquo;all&rdquo; or &ldquo;universal.&rdquo; It is therefore difficult to understand where Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata was situated, but from this literature his position certainly appears greater than that of Vaivasvata Manu, for he was entrusted with all the planetary systems of the entire universe.</div><A NAME="66922"></A><div class="Purport">Another significant statement is that Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu took great satisfaction from abnegating the responsibility for ruling all the planetary systems of the universe. At present, politicians are very eager to take charge of the government, and they engage their men in canvassing from door to door to get votes to win the post of president or a similar exalted office. On the contrary, however, herein we find that King Priyavrata had to be persuaded by Lord Brahm&#257; to accept the post of emperor of the entire universe. Similarly, his father, Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu, felt relieved to entrust the universal government to Priyavrata. Thus it is evident that the kings and executive heads of government in the Vedic age never accepted their positions for sense enjoyment. Such exalted kings, who were known as <span class="Italic">r&#257;jar&#7779;is,</span> ruled only to maintain and protect the kingdom for the welfare of the citizens. The history of Priyavrata and Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu describes how exemplary, responsible monarchs performed the duties of government with disinterest, keeping themselves always aloof from the contamination of material attachment.</div><A NAME="66923"></A><div class="Purport">Material affairs have herein been compared to an ocean of poison.

That is the system of Vedic civilization.

Manu entrusted the government to his son with the permission of the great saint N&#257;rada. This is particularly mentioned because although N&#257;rada wanted Priyavrata to become free from all material affairs, when Priyavrata took charge of the universe by the request of Lord Brahm&#257; and Manu, N&#257;rada was also very pleased.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

They concentrated their minds always upon the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the resting place of the totality of living entities and who is therefore celebrated as V&#257;sudeva. Lord V&#257;sudeva is the only shelter of those who are actually afraid of material existence. By constantly thinking of His lotus feet, these three sons of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata became advanced in pure devotional service. By the prowess of their devotional service, they could directly perceive the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in everyone&rsquo;s heart as the Supersoul, and realize that there was qualitatively no difference between themselves and Him.</div><A NAME="66989"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="66990"></A><div class="First">The <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa</span> stage is the topmost position in renounced life. In <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa,</span> the renounced order, there are four stages&mdash;<span class="Italic">ku&#7789;&#299;caka, bah&#363;daka, parivr&#257;jak&#257;c&#257;rya</span> and <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa.</span> According to the Vedic system, when one accepts the renounced order, he stays outside his village in a cottage, and his necessities, especially his food, are supplied from home. This is called the <span class="Italic">ku&#7789;&#299;caka</span> stage. When a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> advances further, he no longer accepts anything from home: instead, he collects his necessities, especially his food, from many places. This system is called <span class="Italic">m&#257;dhukar&#299;,</span> which literally means &ldquo;the profession of the bumblebees.&rdquo; As bumblebees collect honey from many flowers, a little from each, so a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> should beg from door to door but not accept very much food from any particular house; he should collect a little bit from every house. This is called the <span class="Italic">bah&#363;daka</span> stage. When a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> is still more experienced, he travels all over the world to preach the glories of Lord V&#257;sudeva. He is then known as <span class="Italic">parivr&#257;jak&#257;c&#257;rya.</span> The <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> reaches the <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa</span> stage when he finishes his preaching work and sits down in one place, strictly for the sake of advancing in spiritual life. An actual <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa</span> is one who completely controls his senses and engages in the unalloyed service of the Lord. Therefore all three of these sons of Priyavrata, namely Kavi, Mah&#257;v&#299;ra and Savana, were situated in the <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa</span> stage from the very beginning. Their senses could not disturb them, for their senses were completely engaged in serving the Lord. Therefore the three brothers are described in this verse as <span class="Italic">upa&#347;ama-&#347;&#299;l&#257;&#7717;.</span> <span class="Italic">Upa&#347;ama</span> means &ldquo;completely subdued.&rdquo; Because they completely subdued their senses, they are understood to have been great sages and saints.</div><A NAME="66991"></A><div class="Purport">After subduing their senses, the three brothers concentrated their minds upon the lotus feet of V&#257;sudeva, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index4112.html?g=2631">7.19</a>), <span class="Italic">v&#257;sudeva&#7717; sarvam iti.</span> The lotus feet of V&#257;sudeva are everything. Lord V&#257;sudeva is the reservoir of all living entities. When this cosmic manifestation is dissolved, all living entities enter the supreme body of the Lord, Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, who merges within the body of Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Both of these <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-tattvas</span> are <span class="Italic">v&#257;sudeva-tattvas,</span> and therefore the great sages Kavi, Mah&#257;v&#299;ra and Savana concentrated always upon the lotus feet of Lord V&#257;sudeva, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. In this way they could understand that the Supersoul within the heart is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and they could recognize their identity with Him. The complete description of this realization is that simply by discharging the unalloyed form of devotional service, one can realize his self completely. The <span class="Italic">parama-bhakti-yoga</span> mentioned in this verse means that a living entity, by dint of unalloyed devotional service, has no other interest than the service of the Lord, as described in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">v&#257;sudeva&#7717; sarvam iti</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index4112.html?g=2631">7.19</a>]). By <span class="Italic">parama-bhakti-yoga,</span> by elevating oneself to the highest platform of loving service, one can automatically be relieved from the bodily concept of life and see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face.

Whenever he was determined to fix his arrow upon his bowstring with his two powerful arms, all opponents of the regulative principles of religious life would flee from his presence in fear of the unparalleled prowess he displayed in ruling the universe. He greatly loved his wife Barhi&#7779;mat&#299;, and with the increase of days, their exchange of nuptial love also increased. By her feminine behavior as she dressed herself, walked, got up, smiled, laughed, and glanced about, Queen Barhi&#7779;mat&#299; increased his energy. Thus although he was a great soul, he appeared lost in the feminine conduct of his wife. He behaved with her just like an ordinary man, but actually he was a great soul.</div><A NAME="67014"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="67015"></A><div class="First">In this verse, the word <span class="Italic">dharma-pratipak&#7779;a&#7717;</span> (&ldquo;opponents of religious principles&rdquo;) refers not to a particular faith, but to <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma,</span> the division of society, socially and spiritually, into four <span class="Italic">var&#7751;as</span> (<span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a, k&#7779;atriya, vai&#347;ya</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span>) and four <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;ramas</span> (<span class="Italic">brahmacarya, g&#7771;hastha, v&#257;naprastha</span> and <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span>). To maintain proper social order and help the citizens gradually progress toward the goal of life&mdash;namely spiritual understanding&mdash;the principles of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> must be accepted. From this verse, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata appears to have been so strict in maintaining this institution of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> that anyone neglecting it would immediately flee from his presence as soon as the King warned him by fighting or administering light punishment. Indeed, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata would not have to fight, for simply because of his strong determination, they dared not disobey the rules and regulations of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma.</span> It is said that unless human society is regulated by <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma,</span> it is no better than a bestial society of cats and dogs. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata, therefore, strictly maintained <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> by his extraordinary, unparalleled prowess.</div><A NAME="67016"></A><div class="Purport">To maintain such a life of strict vigilance, one needs encouragement from his wife. In the <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> system, certain classes, such as the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s,</span> do not need encouragement from the opposite sex. <span class="Italic">K&#7779;atriyas</span> and <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hasthas,</span> however, actually need the encouragement of their wives in order to execute their duties. Indeed, a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> or <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> cannot properly execute his responsibilities without the association of his wife. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu personally admitted that a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> must live with a wife. <span class="Italic">K&#7779;atriyas</span> were even allowed to have many wives to encourage them in discharging the duties of government. The association of a good wife is necessary in a life of <span class="Italic">karma</span> and political affairs. To execute his duties properly, therefore. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata took advantage of his good wife Barhi&#7779;mat&#299;, who was always very expert in pleasing her great husband by properly dressing herself, smiling, and exhibiting her feminine bodily features. Queen Barhi&#7779;mat&#299; always kept Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata very encouraged, and thus he executed his governmental duty very properly. In this verse <span class="Italic">iva</span> has twice been used to indicate that Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata acted exactly like a henpecked husband and thereby seemed to have lost his sense of human responsibility. Actually, however, he was fully conscious of his position as a spirit soul, although he seemingly behaved like an acquiescent <span class="Italic">karm&#299;</span> husband. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata thus ruled the universe for eleven <span class="Italic">arbudas</span> of years. One <span class="Italic">arbuda</span> consists of 100,000,000 years, and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata ruled the universe for eleven such <span class="Italic">arbudas.</span></div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Encircling Sumeru Hill on his chariot, the sun-god illuminates all the surrounding planetary systems. However, when the sun is on the northern side of the hill, the south receives less light, and when the sun is in the south, the north receives less. King Priyavrata disliked this situation and therefore decided to make daylight in the part of the universe where there was night. He followed the orbit of the sun-god on a brilliant chariot and thus fulfilled his desire. He could perform such wonderful activities because of the power he had achieved by worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div><A NAME="67026"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="67027"></A><div class="First">There is a Bengali saying which describes that someone is so powerful that he can make the night day and the day night. That saying is current because of the prowess of Priyavrata. His activities demonstrate how powerful he became by worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is known as Yoge&#347;vara, the master of all mystic powers. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexec8a.html?g=6105">18.78</a>) it is said wherever there is the master of all mystic powers (<span class="Italic">yatra yoge&#347;vara&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&#7717;</span>), victory, fortune and all other opulences are present. Devotional service is so powerful. When a devotee achieves what he wants to accomplish, it is not by his own mystic power but by the grace of the master of mystic power. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a: by His grace, a devotee can accomplish wonderful things unimaginable even to the most powerful scientist.</div><A NAME="67028"></A><div class="Purport">From the description in this verse, it appears that the sun moves. According to modern astronomers, the sun is fixed in one place, surrounded by the solar system, but here we find that the sun is not stationary: it is rotating in a prescribed orbit. This fact is corroborated by <span class="Ref_Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> (5.52). <span class="Italic">Yasy&#257;j&ntilde;ay&#257; bhramati sa&#7745;bh&#7771;ta-k&#257;la-cakra&#7717;:</span> the sun is rotating in its fixed orbit in accordance with the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to <span class="Italic">Jyotir Veda,</span> the science of astronomy in the Vedic literature, the sun moves for six months on the northern side of the Sumeru Hill and for six months on the southern side. We have practical experience on this planet that when there is summer in the north there is winter in the south and vice versa. Modern materialistic scientists sometimes present themselves as knowing all the ingredients of the sun, yet they are unable to offer a second sun like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata&rsquo;s.</div><A NAME="67029"></A><div class="Purport">Although Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata devised a very powerful chariot as brilliant as the sun, he had no desire to compete with the sun-god, for a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava never wants to supersede another Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. His purpose was to give abundant benefits in material existence. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura remarks that in the months of April and May the rays of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata&rsquo;s brilliant sun were as pleasing as the rays of the moon, and in October and November, both morning and evening, that sun provided more warmth than the sunshine. In short, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata was extremely powerful, and his actions extended his power in all directions.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Not to speak of a sanctified devotee, even a <span class="Italic">ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la,</span> an outcaste, who is untouchable, is immediately freed from material bondage if he utters the holy name of the Lord even once. Sometimes caste <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> argue that unless one changes his body he cannot be accepted as a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> for since the present body is obtained as a result of past actions, one who has in the past acted as a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> takes birth in a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> family.

This is to be understood without arguments. This verse clearly says, <span class="Italic">sa jah&#257;ti bandham:</span> &ldquo;He gives up his material bondage.&rdquo; The body is a symbolic representation of material bondage according to one&rsquo;s <span class="Italic">karma.</span> Although sometimes we cannot see the gross body changing, chanting the holy name of the Supreme Lord immediately changes the subtle body, and because the subtle body changes, the living entity is immediately freed from material bondage. After all, changes of the gross body are conducted by the subtle body. After the destruction of the gross body, the subtle body takes the living entity from his present gross body to another.

He performed such wonderful acts as creating another sun, which shined during the night, and creating a chariot so great that its wheels formed vast oceans. These activities are so great that modern scientists cannot even imagine how such things can be done. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata acted very wonderfully in the material field of activities, but because he was dealing in sense gratification&mdash;ruling his kingdom and dancing to the indications of his beautiful wife&mdash;he personally condemned himself. When we think about this example of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata, we can just consider how degraded is the modern civilization of materialistic advancement. Modern so-called scientists and other materialists are very satisfied because they can construct great bridges, roads and machines, but such activities are nothing comparable to those of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata. If Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata could condemn himself in spite of his wonderful activities, how condemned we are in our so-called advancement of material civilization. We can conclude that such advancement has nothing to do with the problems of the living entity entangled within this material world. Unfortunately, modern man does not understand his entanglement and how condemned he is, nor does he know what kind of body he is going to have in the next life. From a spiritual point of view, a great kingdom, beautiful wife and wonderful material activities are all impediments to spiritual advancement. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata had served the great sage N&#257;rada sincerely. Therefore even though he had accepted material opulences, he could not be deviated from his own task. He again became K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious.

This is also mentioned in relation to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu, who was born from the dead body of his father by the manipulation of great sages.

The Nai&#7779;&#257;da race was given a place in the forest because by nature they are thieves and rogues.

Once Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#256;gn&#299;dhra desired to have a son, and therefore he entered a cave of Mandara Mountain to practice austerity. Understanding his desire, Lord Brahm&#257; sent a celestial girl named P&#363;rvacitti to &#256;gn&#299;dhra&rsquo;s hermitage. After dressing herself very attractively, she presented herself before him with various feminine movements, and &#256;gn&#299;dhra was naturally attracted to her. The girl&rsquo;s actions, expressions, smile, sweet words and moving eyes were fascinating to him. &#256;gn&#299;dhra was expert in flattery. Thus he attracted the celestial girl, who was pleased to accept him as her husband because of his mellifluous words. She enjoyed royal happiness with &#256;gn&#299;dhra for many years before returning to her abode in the heavenly planets. In her womb &#256;gn&#299;dhra begot nine sons&mdash;N&#257;bhi, Ki&#7745;puru&#7779;a, Harivar&#7779;a, Il&#257;v&#7771;ta, Ramyaka, Hira&#7751;maya, Kuru, Bhadr&#257;&#347;va and Ketum&#257;la.

These principles are exactly contrary to the modern principles of faithlessness. As clearly stated here, the King protected the citizens the way a father protects his begotten children. How he ruled the citizens is also described here&mdash;<span class="Italic">dharm&#257;vek&#7779;am&#257;&#7751;a&#7717;,</span> strictly according to religious principles. It is the duty of the executive head of a state to see that the citizens strictly follow religious principles. The Vedic religious principles begin with <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma,</span> the duties of the four <span class="Italic">var&#7751;as</span> and four <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;ramas.</span> <span class="Italic">Dharma</span> refers to principles given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The first principle of <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> or religion, is to observe the duties of the four orders as enjoined by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to people&rsquo;s qualities and activities, society should be divided into <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as, k&#7779;atriyas, vai&#347;yas</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> and then again into <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;s, g&#7771;hasthas, v&#257;naprasthas</span> and <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s.</span> These are religious principles, and it is the duty of the head of state to see that his citizens strictly follow them. He should not merely act officially; he should be like a father who is always a well-wisher of his sons. Such a father strictly observes whether his sons are performing their duties, and sometimes he also punishes them.</div><A NAME="67199"></A><div class="Purport">Just contrary to the principles mentioned here, the presidents and chief executives in the age of Kali are simply tax collectors who do not care whether religious principles are observed. Indeed, the chief executives of the present day introduce all kinds of sinful activity, especially illicit sex, intoxication, animal killing and gambling. These sinful activities are now very prominently manifested in India. Although a hundred years ago these four principles of sinful life were strictly prohibited in the families of India, they have now been introduced into every Indian family; therefore they cannot follow religious principles. In contrast to the principles of the kings of old, the modern state is concerned only with propaganda for levying taxes and is no longer responsible for the spiritual welfare of the citizens. The state is now callous to religious principles. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> predicts that in Kali-yuga the government will be entrusted with <span class="Italic">dasyu-dharma,</span> which means the occupational duty of rogues and thieves. Modern heads of state are rogues and thieves who plunder the citizens instead of giving them protection. Rogues and thieves plunder without regard for law, but in this age of Kali, as stated in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> the lawmakers themselves plunder the citizens. The next prediction to be fulfilled, which is already coming to pass, is that because of the sinful activities of the citizens and the government, rain will become increasingly scarce. Gradually there will be complete drought and no production of food grains. People will be reduced to eating flesh and seeds, and many good, spiritually inclined people will have to forsake their homes because they will be too harassed by drought, taxation and famine. The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is the only hope to save the world from such devastation. It is the most scientific and authorized movement for the actual welfare of the whole human society.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Pit&#7771;loka is mentioned in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">y&#257;nti deva-vrat&#257; dev&#257;n pit&#7773;n y&#257;nti pit&#7771;-vrat&#257;&#7717; </I>[Bg. </I><a href="index0567.html?g=3210">9.25</a></I>]</I></span>). To go to this planet, one needs very good sons who can make offerings to Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and then offer the remnants to their forefathers. The purpose of the <span class="Italic">&#347;r&#257;ddha</span> ceremony is to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, so that after pleasing Him one may offer <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da</span> to one&rsquo;s forefathers and in this way make them happy. The inhabitants of Pit&#7771;loka are generally men of the <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;&#299;ya,</span> or fruitive activities category, who have been transferred there because of their pious activities. They can stay there as long as their descendants offer them <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-pras&#257;da.</span> Everyone in heavenly planets such as Pit&#7771;loka, however, must return to earth after exhausting the effects of his pious acts. As confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index1885.html?g=3174">9.21</a>), <span class="Italic">k&#7779;&#299;&#7751;e pu&#7751;ye martya-loka&#7745; vi&#347;anti:</span> persons who perform pious acts are transferred to higher planets, but when the effects of their pious acts are over, they are again transferred to earth.</div><A NAME="67211"></A><div class="Purport">Since Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata was a great devotee, how could he have begotten a son who desired to be transferred to Pit&#7771;loka? Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says, <span class="Italic">pit&#7773;n y&#257;nti pit&#7771;-vrat&#257;&#7717;:</span> persons who desire to go to Pit&#7771;loka are transferred there. Similarly, <span class="Italic">y&#257;nti mad-y&#257;jino &rsquo;pi m&#257;m:</span> persons who desire to be transferred to the spiritual planets, Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;halokas, can also go there. Since Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#256;gn&#299;dhra was the son of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, he should have desired to be transferred to the spiritual world, Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka. Why, then, did he desire to be transferred to Pit&#7771;loka? In answer to this, Gosv&#257;m&#299; Giridhara, one of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> commentators, remarks that &#256;gn&#299;dhra was born when Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata was infatuated by lusty desires. This may be accepted as a fact because sons are begotten with different mentalities according to the time of their conception. According to the Vedic system, therefore, before a child is conceived, the <span class="Italic">garbh&#257;dh&#257;na-sa&#7745;sk&#257;ra</span> is performed. This ceremony molds the mentality of the father in such a way that when he plants his seed in the womb of his wife, he will beget a child whose mind will be completely saturated with a devotional attitude. At the present moment, however, there are no such <span class="Italic">garbh&#257;dh&#257;na-sa&#7745;sk&#257;ras,</span> and therefore people generally have a lusty attitude when they beget children. Especially in this age of Kali, there are no <span class="Italic">garbh&#257;dh&#257;na</span> ceremonies; everyone enjoys sex with his wife like a cat or dog. Therefore according to &#347;&#257;stric injunctions, almost all the people of this age belong to the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> category. Of course, although Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#256;gn&#299;dhra had a desire to be transferred to Pit&#7771;loka, this does not mean that his mentality was that of a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra;</span> he was a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya.</span></div><A NAME="67212"></A><div class="Purport">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#256;gn&#299;dhra desired to be transferred to Pit&#7771;loka, and therefore he needed a wife because anyone desiring to be transferred to Pit&#7771;loka must leave behind a good son to offer yearly <span class="Italic">pi&#7751;&#7693;a,</span> or <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da</span> from Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. To have a good son, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#256;gn&#299;dhra wanted a wife from a family of demigods. Therefore he went to Mandara Hill. where the women of the demigods generally come, to worship Lord Brahm&#257;. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index70d8.html?g=1532">4.12</a>) it is said, <span class="Italic">k&#257;&#7749;k&#7779;anta&#7717; karma&#7751;&#257;&#7745; siddhi&#7745; yajanta iha devat&#257;&#7717;:</span> materialists who want quick results in the material world worship demigods.

The practice of <span class="Italic">yoga</span> is undoubtedly good because it controls the senses, which are like venomous serpents. When one engages in devotional service, however, completely employing all the activities of the senses in the service of the Lord, the venomous quality of the senses is completely nullified. It is explained that a serpent is to be feared because of its poison fangs, but if those fangs are broken. the serpent, although it seems fearsome, is not at all dangerous. Devotees, therefore, may see hundreds and thousands of beautiful women with fascinating bodily movements and gestures but not be allured, whereas such women would make ordinary <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> fall. Even the advanced <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra broke his mystic practice to unite with Menak&#257; and beget a child known as &#346;akuntal&#257;. The practice of mystic <span class="Italic">yoga,</span> therefore, is not sufficiently strong to control the senses. Another example is Prince &#256;gn&#299;dhra, whose attention was drawn to the movements of P&#363;rvacitti, the Apsar&#257;, simply because he heard the tinkling of her ankle bells. In the same way that Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra Muni was attracted by the tinkling bangles of Menak&#257;, Prince &#256;gn&#299;dhra, upon hearing the tinkling bangles of P&#363;rvacitti, immediately opened his eyes to see her beautiful movements as she walked. The prince was also very handsome. As described herein, his eyes were just like the buds of lotus flowers.

smelled the beautiful and attractive flowers. She could attract the minds and vision of both humans and demigods by her playful movements, her shyness and humility, her glances, the very pleasing sounds that poured from her mouth as she spoke, and the motion of her limbs. By all these qualities, she opened for Cupid, who bears an arrow of flowers, a path of aural reception into the minds of men. When she spoke, nectar seemed to flow from her mouth. As she breathed, the bees, mad for the taste of her breath, tried to hover about her beautiful lotuslike eyes. Disturbed by the bees, she tried to move hastily, but as she raised her feet to walk quickly, her hair, the belt on her hips, and her breasts, which were like water jugs, also moved in a way that made her extremely beautiful and attractive. Indeed, she seemed to be making a path for the entrance of Cupid, who is most powerful. Therefore the prince, completely subdued by seeing her, spoke to her as follows.</div><A NAME="67254"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="67255"></A><div class="First">How a beautiful woman&rsquo;s movements and gestures, her hair and the structure of her breasts, hips and other bodily features attract the minds not only of men but of demigods also is very finely described in this statement. The words <span class="Italic">divija</span> and <span class="Italic">manuja</span> specifically emphasize that the attraction of feminine gestures is powerful everywhere within this material world, both on this planet and in the higher planetary systems. It is said that the standard of living in the higher planetary systems is thousands and thousands of times higher than the standard of living on this planet. Therefore the beautiful bodily features of the women there are also thousands and thousands of times more attractive than the features of the women on earth. The creator has constructed women in such a way that their beautiful voices and movements and the beautiful features of their hips, their breasts, and the other parts of their bodies attract the members of the opposite sex, both on earth and on other planets, and awaken their lusty desires. When one is controlled by Cupid or the beauty of women, he becomes stunned like matter such as stone. Captivated by the material movements of women, he wants to remain in this material world. Thus one&rsquo;s promotion to the spiritual world is checked simply by seeing the beautiful bodily structure and movements of women. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu has therefore warned all devotees to beware of the attraction of beautiful women and materialistic civilization. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu even refused to see Prat&#257;parudra Mah&#257;r&#257;ja because he was a very opulent person in the material world. Lord Caitanya said in this connection, <span class="Italic">ni&#7779;ki&ntilde;canasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukhasya:</span> those who are engaged in the devotional service of the Lord because they are very serious about going back home, back to Godhead, should be very careful to avoid seeing the beautiful gestures of women and should also avoid seeing persons who are very rich.</div><A NAME="67256"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">ni&#7779;ki&ntilde;canasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukhasya<br>p&#257;ra&#7745; para&#7745; jigami&#7779;or bhava-s&#257;garasya<br>sandar&#347;ana&#7745; vi&#7779;ayi&#7751;&#257;m atha yo&#7779;it&#257;&#7745; ca<br>h&#257; hanta hanta vi&#7779;a-bhak&#7779;a&#7751;ato &rsquo;py as&#257;dhu</div></div><A NAME="67257"></A><div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Alas, for a person who is seriously desiring to cross the material ocean and engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord without material motives, seeing a materialist engaged in sense gratification or seeing a woman who is similarly interested is more abominable than drinking poison willingly.&rdquo; (<span class="Ref_Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta, Madhya</span> <a href="indexeb50.html?g=110641">11.8</a>) One who is serious about going back home, back to Godhead, should not contemplate the attractive features of women and the opulence of rich men.

Indeed, he was surprised to see such exceptional beauty, which must have been the result of past austerities and penances. He therefore asked the girl whether she had achieved such beauty just to break the penances and austerities of others. He thought that Lord Brahm&#257;, the creator of the universe, might have been pleased with him and might therefore have sent her to become his wife. He requested P&#363;rvacitti to become his wife so that together they could perform austerities and penances in family life. In other words, a suitable wife helps her husband perform penances and austerities in household life if both of them are on the same elevated platform of spiritual understanding. Without spiritual understanding, husband and wife cannot be equally situated. Lord Brahm&#257;, the creator of the universe, is interested in good progeny. Therefore unless he is pleased, one cannot get a suitable wife. In fact, Lord Brahm&#257; is worshiped in marriage ceremonies.

When &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva appeared as the son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja N&#257;bhi, He was appreciated by the people as the most exalted and beautiful personality of that age. His poise, influence, strength, enthusiasm, bodily luster and other transcendental qualities were beyond compare. The word <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;abha</span> refers to the best, or the supreme. Due to the superexcellent attributes of the son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja N&#257;bhi, the King named his son &#7770;&#7779;abha, or &ldquo;the best.&rdquo; His influence was incomparable. Although there was a scarcity of rain, &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva did not care for Indra, the King of heaven, who is in charge of supplying rain. Through His own potency, &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva sumptuously covered Ajan&#257;bha with ample rain. Upon receiving &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as his son, King N&#257;bhi began to raise Him very carefully. After that, he entrusted the ruling power to Him and, retiring from family life, lived at Badarik&#257;&#347;rama completely engaged in the worship of V&#257;sudeva, the Supreme Lord. To follow social customs, Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva for a while became a student in the <span class="Italic">gurukula,</span> and after returning. He followed the orders of His <span class="Italic">guru</span> and accepted a wife named Jayant&#299;, who had been given to Him by the King of heaven, Indra. He begot a hundred sons in the womb of Jayant&#299;. Of these hundred sons, the eldest was known as Bharata. Since the reign of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata, this planet has been called Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a. &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva&rsquo;s other sons were headed by Ku&#347;&#257;varta, Il&#257;varta, Brahm&#257;varta, Malaya, Ketu, Bhadrasena, Indrasp&#7771;k, Vidarbha and K&#299;ka&#7789;a. There were also other sons named Kavi, Havi, Antarik&#7779;a, Prabuddha, Pippal&#257;yana, Avirhotra, Drumila, Camasa and Karabh&#257;jana. Instead of ruling the kingdom, these nine became mendicant preachers of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, following the religious precepts of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> Their characteristics and activities are described in the Eleventh Canto of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> during the talks between Vasudeva and N&#257;rada at Kuruk&#7779;etra.

The first symptom of one so liberated is that he is freed from all sinful activity (<span class="Italic">apahata-p&#257;pa</span>). As long as one is under the clutches of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> in the material energy, one has to engage in sinful activity. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> describes such people as <span class="Italic">du&#7779;k&#7771;tina&#7717;,</span> which indicates that they are always engaged in sinful activity. One who is liberated in this life does not commit any sinful activities. Sinful activity involves illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. Another symptom of a liberated person is <span class="Italic">vijara,</span> which indicates that he is not subjected to the miseries of old age. Another symptom is <span class="Italic">vim&#7771;tyu.</span> A liberated person prepares himself in such a way that he does not take on any more material bodies, which are destined to die. In other words. he does not fall down again to repeat birth and death. Another symptom is <span class="Italic">vi&#347;oka,</span> which indicates that he is callous to material distress and happiness. Another is <span class="Italic">vijighatsa,</span> which indicates that he no longer desires material enjoyment. Another symptom is <span class="Italic">apip&#257;t&#257;,</span> which means that he has no desire other than to engage in the devotional service of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, his dearmost pursuable Lord. A further symptom is <span class="Italic">satya-k&#257;ma,</span> which indicates that all his desires are directed to the Supreme Truth, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. He does not want anything else. He is <span class="Italic">satya-sa&#7749;kalpa.</span> Whatever he desires is fulfilled by the grace of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. First of all, he does not desire anything for his material benefit, and secondly if he desires anything at all, he simply desires to serve the Supreme Lord. That desire is fulfilled by the Lord&rsquo;s grace.

In due course of time, the principles of var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma had become neglected; therefore through His personal characteristics and behavior, He taught the ignorant public how to perform duties within the var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma. In this way He regulated the general populace in householder life, enabling them to develop religion and economic well-being and to attain reputations, sons and daughters, material pleasure and finally eternal life.

It is stated in this chapter that a human being should not work hard like dogs and hogs for sense gratification. The human life is especially meant for the revival of our relationship with the Supreme Lord, and to this end all kinds of austerities and penances should be accepted. By austere activities, one&rsquo;s heart can be cleansed of material contamination, and as a result one can be situated on the spiritual platform. To attain this perfection, one has to take shelter of a devotee and serve him. Then the door of liberation will be open. Those who are materially attached to women and sense gratification gradually become entangled in material consciousness and suffer the miseries of birth, old age, disease and death. Those who are engaged in the general welfare of all and who are not attached to children and family are called <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;s.</span> Those who are engaged in sense gratification. who act piously or impiously, cannot understand the purpose of the soul. Therefore they should approach a highly elevated devotee and accept him as a spiritual master. By his association, one will be able to understand the purpose of life. Under the instructions of such a spiritual master, one can attain devotional service to the Lord, detachment from material things, and tolerance of material misery and distress. One can then see all living entities equally, and one becomes very eager to know about transcendental subject matters. Endeavoring persistently for the satisfaction of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, one becomes detached from wife, children and home. He is not interested in wasting time. In this way one becomes self-realized. A person advanced in spiritual knowledge does not engage anyone in material activity. And one who cannot deliver another person by instructing him in devotional service should not become a spiritual master, father, mother, demigod or husband. Instructing His one hundred sons, Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva advised them to accept their eldest brother, Bharata, as their guide and lord, and thereby serve him. Of all living entities, the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are the best, and above the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> the Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas are situated in an even better position. Serving a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava means serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; describes the characteristics of Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and the sacrificial performance executed by Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva for the instruction of the general populace.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The word <span class="Italic">deha-bh&#257;k</span> refers to anyone who accepts a material body, but the living entity who is awarded the human form must act differently from animals. Animals like dogs and hogs enjoy sense gratification by eating stool. After undergoing severe hardships all day, human beings are trying to enjoy themselves at night by eating, drinking, having sex and sleeping. At the same time, they have to properly defend themselves. However, this is not human civilization. Human life means voluntarily practicing suffering for the advancement of spiritual life. There is, of course, suffering in the lives of animals and plants, which are suffering due to their past misdeeds. However, human beings should voluntarily accept suffering in the form of austerities and penances in order to attain the divine life. After attaining the divine life, one can enjoy happiness eternally. After all, every living entity is trying to enjoy happiness, but as long as one is encaged in the material body, he has to suffer different kinds of misery. A higher sense is present in the human form. We should act according to superior advice in order to attain eternal happiness and go back to Godhead.</div><A NAME="67960"></A><div class="Purport">It is significant in this verse that the government and the natural guardian, the father, should educate subordinates and raise them to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness.

To relieve them from this bondage and enable them to become blissful and happy, <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> should be taught.

The instructions of &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva are very essential at the present moment. People are being educated and trained to work very hard for sense gratification, and there is no sublime aim in life. A man travels to earn his livelihood, leaving home early in the morning, catching a local train and being packed in a compartment. He has to stand for an hour or two in order to reach his place of business. Then again he takes a bus to get to the office. At the office he works hard from nine to five; then he takes two or three hours to return home. After eating, he has sex and goes to sleep. For all this hardship, his only happiness is a little sex. <span class="Italic">Yan maithun&#257;di-g&#7771;hamedhi-sukha&#7745; hi tuccham</I> [SB </span></I><a href="indexaa4a.html?g=57238">7.9.45</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva clearly states that human life is not meant for this kind of existence, which is enjoyed even by dogs and hogs.

In this way, you should place your faith and love in Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You should detest sense gratification and tolerate the duality of pleasure and pain, which are like the seasonal changes of summer and winter. Try to realize the miserable condition of living entities, who are miserable even in the higher planetary systems. Philosophically inquire about the truth. Then undergo all kinds of austerities and penances for the sake of devotional service. Give up the endeavor for sense enjoyment and engage in the service of the Lord. Listen to discussions about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and always associate with devotees. Chant about and glorify the Supreme Lord, and look upon everyone equally on the spiritual platform. Give up enmity and subdue anger and lamentation. Abandon identifying the self with the body and the home, and practice reading the revealed scriptures. Live in a secluded place and practice the process by which you can completely control your life air, mind and senses. Have full faith in the revealed scriptures, the Vedic literatures, and always observe celibacy. Perform your prescribed duties and avoid unnecessary talks. Always thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, acquire knowledge from the right source. Thus practicing bhakti-yoga, you will patiently and enthusiastically be elevated in knowledge and will be able to give up the false ego.</div><A NAME="68108"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="68109"></A><div class="First">In these four verses, &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva tells His sons how they can be freed from the false identification arising from false ego and material conditional life.

All these prescribed methods enable one to give up the material body (<span class="Italic">li&#7749;ga&#7745; vyapohet</span>) and be situated in his original spiritual body.

The heart is situated within the chest, and although instrumentally the son is born with the aid of the genitals, he is actually born from within the heart. According to the heart&rsquo;s situation. the semen takes the form of a body. Therefore according to the Vedic system, when one begets a child his heart should be purified through the ritualistic ceremony known as <span class="Italic">garbh&#257;dh&#257;na.</span> &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva&rsquo;s heart was always uncontaminated and spiritual. Consequently all the sons born from the heart of &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva were spiritually inclined. Nonetheless. &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva suggested that His eldest son was superior, and He advised the others to serve him. All the brothers of Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja were advised by &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva to adhere to Bharata&rsquo;s service. The question may be asked why one should be attached to family members, for in the beginning it was advised that one should not be attached to home and family. However, it is also advised, <span class="Italic">mah&#299;yas&#257;m p&#257;da-rajo-&rsquo;bhi&#7779;eka</span>&mdash;one has to serve the <span class="Italic">mah&#299;y&#257;n,</span> one who is very spiritually advanced. <span class="Italic">Mahat-sev&#257;&#7745; dv&#257;ram &#257;hur vimukte&#7717;:</I> [SB </span></I><a href="index2715.html?g=42747">5.5.2</a>] by serving the <span class="Italic">mahat,</span> the exalted devotee, one&rsquo;s path for liberation is open. The family of &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva should not be compared to an ordinary materialistic family. Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva&rsquo;s eldest son, was specifically very exalted. For this reason the other sons were advised to serve him for his pleasure. That was to be their duty.</div><A NAME="68236"></A><div class="Purport">The Supreme Lord was advising Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja to be the chief ruler of the planet. This is the real plan of the Supreme Lord. In the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra, we find that Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a wanted Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira to be the supreme emperor of this planet. He never wanted Duryodhana to take the post. As stated in the previous verse, Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva&rsquo;s heart is <span class="Italic">h&#7771;daya&#7745; yatra dharma&#7717;.</span> The characteristic <span class="Italic">dharma</span> is also explained in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;:</span> surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. To protect <span class="Italic">dharma</span> (<span class="Italic">paritr&#257;&#7751;&#257;ya s&#257;dh&#363;n&#257;m</span>), the Lord always wants the ruler of the earth to be a devotee. Then everything goes on nicely for the benefit of everyone. As soon as a demon rules the earth, everything becomes chaotic. At the present moment, the world is inclined toward the democratic process, but the people in general are all contaminated by the modes of passion and ignorance. Consequently they cannot select the right person to head the government. The president is selected by the votes of ignorant <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras;</span> therefore another <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> is elected, and immediately the entire government becomes polluted. If people strictly followed the principles of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> <span class="Italic"></I>they</span></I> would elect a person who is the Lord&rsquo;s devotee. Then automatically there would be good government. &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva therefore recommended Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja as the emperor of this planet. Serving a devotee means serving the Supreme Lord, for a devotee always represents the Lord. When a devotee is in charge, the government is always congenial and beneficial for everyone.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Although He could do all this, He did not exercise these powers.</div><A NAME="68429"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="68430"></A><div class="First">In the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Madhya</span> <a href="indexe262.html?g=124131">19.149</a>) it is said:</div><A NAME="68431"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-bhakta&mdash;&mdash;ni&#7779;k&#257;ma, ataeva &lsquo;&#347;&#257;nta&rsquo;<br>bhukti-mukti-siddhi-k&#257;m&#299;&mdash;&mdash;sakali &lsquo;a&#347;&#257;nta&rsquo;</div></div><A NAME="68432"></A><div class="After-Verse">The word <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;nta</span> means completely peaceful.

Those in the material world are <span class="Italic">a&#347;&#257;nta</span> (without peace) because they have so many desires to fulfill. The pure devotee, however, is without desire. <span class="Italic">Any&#257;bhil&#257;&#7779;it&#257;-&#347;&#363;nya:</span> a pure devotee is completely free from all kinds of material desire. <span class="Italic">Karm&#299;s,</span> on the other hand, are simply full of desires because they try to enjoy sense gratification. They are not peaceful in this life, nor the next, during the past, present or future. Similarly, <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s</span> are always aspiring after liberation and trying to become one with the Supreme. <span class="Italic">Yog&#299;s</span> are aspiring after many <span class="Italic">siddhis</span> (powers)&mdash;<span class="Italic">a&#7751;im&#257;, laghim&#257;, pr&#257;pti,</span> etc. However, a devotee is not at all interested in these things because he is fully dependent on the mercy of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is <span class="Italic">yoge&#347;vara,</span> the possessor of all mystic powers (<span class="Italic">siddhis</span>), and He is <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;r&#257;ma,</span> fully self-satisfied. The <span class="Italic">yoga-siddhis</span> are described in this verse. One can fly in outer space without the aid of a machine, and he can travel at the speed of mind. This means that as soon as a <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> desires to go somewhere within this universe or even beyond this universe, he can do so immediately. One cannot estimate the speed of mind, for within a second the mind can go many millions of miles. Sometimes <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> enter into the bodies of other people and act as they desire when their bodies are not working properly. When the body becomes old, a perfect <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> can find a young, able body. Giving up his old body, the <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> can enter into the young body and act as he pleases. Being a plenary expansion of Lord V&#257;sudeva, Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva possessed all these mystic <span class="Italic">yoga</span> powers, but He was satisfied with His devotional love of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, which was evinced by the ecstatic symptoms, such as crying, laughing and shivering.</div><A NAME="68433"></A><div class="Thus-end">Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Fifth Chapter of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> entitled &ldquo;Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva&rsquo;s Teachings to His Sons.&rdquo;</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

He was not attached to His body even when it was being burned up in a forest fire. When the seed of fruitive activity is burned by the fire of knowledge, the spiritual properties and mystic powers are automatically manifest, yet <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> is not affected by these mystic powers. An ordinary <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> is captivated by mystic powers and his progress checked; therefore a perfect <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> does not welcome them. Because the mind is restless and undependable, it must remain always under control. Even the mind of the advanced <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> Saubhari created such a disturbance that he lost his yogic mystic powers. Due to a restless mind, even a very advanced <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> can fall down. The mind is so restless that it induces even a perfect <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> to be controlled by the senses. Therefore Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva, for the instruction of all <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s,</span> showed the process of quitting the body. While traveling in South India, through the provinces of Kar&#7751;&#257;&#7789;a, Ko&#7749;ka, Ve&#7749;ka and Ku&#7789;aka, Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva arrived in the neighborhood of Ku&#7789;ak&#257;cala. Suddenly there was a forest fire that burned the forest and Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva&rsquo;s body to ashes. The pastimes of Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva as a liberated soul were known by the King of Ko&#7749;ka, Ve&#7749;ka and Ku&#7789;aka. This King&rsquo;s name was Arhat. He later became captivated by the illusory energy, and in this condition he set forth the basic principles of Jainism. Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva set forth the principles of religion that can free one from material bondage, and He put an end to all kinds of atheistic activities. On this earth, the place known as Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a was a very pious land because the Supreme Lord appeared there when He wanted to incarnate.<br>Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva neglected all the mystic powers for which the so-called <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> hanker. Because of the beauty of devotional service, devotees are not at all interested in so-called mystic power. The master of all yogic power, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, can exhibit all powers on behalf of His devotee. Devotional service is more valuable than yogic mystic powers. Devotees who are sometimes misled aspire for liberation and mystic powers. The Supreme Lord gives these devotees whatever they desire, but they cannot attain the most important function of devotional service. Devotional service to the Lord is guaranteed for those who do not desire liberation and mystic power.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Whatever is necessary for the discharge of devotional service is automatically attained, though it may appear to be the result of mystic <span class="Italic">yoga</span> power. Sometimes a <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> displays a little yogic power by manufacturing gold. A little quantity of gold captivates foolish people, and thus the <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> gets many followers, who are willing to accept such a tiny person as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> may also advertise himself as Bhagav&#257;n. However, a devotee does not have to exhibit such magical wonders. Without practicing the mystic yogic process, he achieves even greater opulence all over the world. Under the circumstances, Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva refused to manifest mystic yogic perfections, and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it asked why He did not accept them, since, for a devotee, they are not at all disturbing. A devotee is never distressed or satisfied by material opulence. His concern is how to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If, by the grace of the Supreme Lord, a devotee achieves extraordinary opulence, he utilizes the opportunity for the Lord&rsquo;s service. He is not disturbed by the opulence.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

This example is given here because a <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> desiring to get free from material conditions must always keep his mind under control. &#346;r&#299;la Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura used to say that in the morning our first business should be to beat the mind with shoes a hundred times. and, before going to bed, to beat the mind a hundred times with a broomstick. In this way one&rsquo;s mind can be kept under control. An uncontrolled mind and an unchaste wife are the same. An unchaste wife can kill her husband at any time, and an uncontrolled mind, followed by lust, anger, greed, madness, envy and illusion, can certainly kill the <span class="Italic">yog&#299;.</span> When the <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> is controlled by the mind, he falls down into the material condition. One should be very careful of the mind, just as a husband should be careful of an unchaste wife.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

He is your spiritual master, worshipable Deity, friend, and the director of your activities. To say nothing of this, He sometimes serves your family as a messenger or servant. This means He worked just as ordinary servants do.

Especially glorious is the dynasty of Priyavrata, in which the Supreme Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva incarnated. Similarly, the family of Utt&#257;nap&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, the father of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Dhruva, is also glorious due to King P&#7771;thu&rsquo;s taking birth in it. The dynasty of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Raghu is glorified because Lord R&#257;macandra appeared in that family. As far as the Yadu and Kuru dynasties are concerned, they existed simultaneously, but of the two, the Yadu dynasty was more glorious due to the appearance of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it might have been thinking that the Kuru dynasty was not as fortunate as the others because the Supreme Lord did not appear in that family, neither as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Lord R&#257;macandra, Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva or Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu. Therefore Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was encouraged by &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; in this particular verse.</div><A NAME="68672"></A><div class="Purport">The Kuru dynasty may be considered more glorious due to the presence of devotees like the five P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, who rendered unalloyed devotional service. Although Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a did not appear in the Kuru dynasty. He was so obligated to the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas&rsquo; devotional service that He acted as a maintainer of the family and spiritual master of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas. Although He took birth in the Yadu dynasty, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was more affectionate to the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas. By His actions, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a proved that He was more inclined to the Kuru dynasty than the Yadu dynasty. Indeed, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, indebted to the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas&rsquo; devotional service, sometimes acted as their messenger, and He guided them through many dangerous situations. Therefore Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it should not have been saddened because Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a did not appear in his family. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is always inclined toward His pure devotees, and by His action it is clear that liberation is not very important for the devotees. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a easily gives one liberation, but He does not so easily give one the facility to become a devotee. <span class="Italic">Mukti&#7745; dad&#257;ti karhicit sma na bhakti-yogam.</span> Directly or indirectly, it is proved that <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> is the basis for the supreme relationship with the Supreme Lord.

As confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexc2a1.html?g=5889">18.54</a>): <span class="Italic">Brahma-bh&#363;ta&#7717; prasann&#257;tm&#257; na &#347;ocati na k&#257;&#7749;k&#7779;ati.</span> This is the goal of all living entities. Even though one may be situated within this material world, he can become fully satisfied and devoid of hankering and lamentation simply by following the instructions of the Lord as set forth in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> or <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> Satisfaction through self-realization is called <span class="Italic">svar&#363;p&#257;nanda.</span> The conditioned soul, eternally sleeping in darkness, does not understand his self-interest.

To try to become happy by adjusting the material atmosphere is a useless endeavor. Indeed, it is impossible. By His personal behavior and instructions, Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva enlightened the conditioned soul and showed him how to become self-sufficient in his spiritual identity.</div><A NAME="68687"></A><div class="Thus-end">Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Sixth Chapter, of the <span class="non-Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> entitled &ldquo;The Activities of Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva.&rdquo;</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja performed various ritualistic ceremonies (Vedic <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;as</span>) and satisfied the Supreme Lord by his different modes of worship. In due course of time, he left home and resided in Hardwar and passed his days in devotional activities. Being ordered by his father, Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva, Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja married Pa&ntilde;cajan&#299;, the daughter of Vi&#347;var&#363;pa. After this, he ruled the whole world peacefully. Formerly this planet was known as Ajan&#257;bha, and after the reign of Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja it became known as Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a. Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja begot five sons in the womb of Pa&ntilde;cajan&#299;, and he named the sons Sumati, R&#257;&#7779;&#7789;rabh&#7771;ta, Sudar&#347;ana, &#256;vara&#7751;a and Dh&#363;mraketu. Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was very rigid in executing religious principles and following in the footsteps of his father. He therefore ruled the citizens very successfully. Because he performed various <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;as</span> to satisfy the Supreme Lord, he was personally very satisfied. Being of undisturbed mind, he increased his devotional activities unto Lord V&#257;sudeva. Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was competent in understanding the principles of saintly persons like N&#257;rada, and he followed in the footsteps of the sages. He also kept Lord V&#257;sudeva constantly within his heart. After finishing his kingly duties, he divided his kingdom among his five sons. He then left home and went to the place of Pulaha known as Pulah&#257;&#347;rama. There he ate forest vegetables and fruits, and worshiped Lord V&#257;sudeva with everything available. Thus he increased his devotion toward V&#257;sudeva, and he automatically began to realize further his transcendental, blissful life. Due to his highly advanced spiritual position, there were sometimes visible in his body the <span class="Italic">a&#7779;&#7789;a-s&#257;ttvika</span> transformations, such as ecstatic crying and bodily trembling, which are symptoms of love of Godhead. It is understood that Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata worshiped the Supreme Lord with the <span class="Italic">mantras</span> mentioned in the <span class="Italic">&#7770;g Veda,</span> generally known as G&#257;yatr&#299; <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> which aim at the Supreme N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a situated within the sun.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

In other words, he performed all the yaj&ntilde;as for the satisfaction of Lord V&#257;sudeva, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata thought that since the demigods were different parts of V&#257;sudeva&rsquo;s body, He controls those who are explained in the Vedic mantras. By thinking in this way, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata was freed from all material contamination, such as attachment, lust and greed. When the priests were about to offer the sacrificial ingredients into the fire, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata expertly understood how the offering made to different demigods was simply an offering to the different limbs of the Lord. For instance, Indra is the arm of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and S&#363;rya [the sun] is His eye. Thus Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata considered that the oblations offered to different demigods were actually offered unto the different limbs of Lord V&#257;sudeva.</div><A NAME="68756"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="68757"></A><div class="First">The Supreme Personality of Godhead says that as long as one does not develop the pure devotional service of <span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;a&#7745; k&#299;rtanam,</span> hearing and chanting, one must carry out his prescribed duties. Since Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was a great devotee, one may ask why he performed so many sacrifices that are actually meant for <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s.</span> The fact is that he was simply following the orders of V&#257;sudeva. As K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> <span class="Italic">sarva dharm&#257;n parityajya m&#257;m eka&#7745; &#347;ara&#7751;a&#7745; vraja:</span> &ldquo;Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me.&rdquo; (Bg. <a href="index3a32.html?g=5997">18.66</a>) Whatever we do, we should constantly remember V&#257;sudeva. People are generally addicted to offering obeisances to various demigods, but Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja simply wanted to please Lord V&#257;sudeva. As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;:</span> <span class="Italic">bhokt&#257;ra&#7745; yaj&ntilde;a-tapas&#257;&#7745; sarva-loka-mahe&#347;varam</span> (Bg. <a href="index2ceb.html?g=2055">5.29</a>). A <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a</span> may be carried out to satisfy a particular demigod, but when the <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a is</span> offered to the <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;a-puru&#7779;a,</span> N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, the demigods are satisfied. The purpose of performing different <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;as</span> is to satisfy the Supreme Lord. One may perform them in the name of different demigods or directly. If we directly offer oblations to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demigods are automatically satisfied. If we water the root of a tree, the branches, twigs, fruits and flowers are automatically satisfied. When one offers sacrifices to different demigods, one should remember that the demigods are simply parts of the body of the Supreme. If we worship the hand of a person, we intend to satisfy the person himself. If we massage a person&rsquo;s legs, we do not really serve the legs but the person who possesses the legs. All the demigods are different parts of the Lord, and if we offer service to them, we actually serve the Lord Himself. Demigod worship is mentioned in <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;, but</span> actually the <span class="Italic">&#347;lokas</span> advocate worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda.

Similarly, we should offer respects to Brahm&#257;, Agni and S&#363;rya. There are many offerings to different demigods, and one should always remember that these offerings are usually meant to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

One day after Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja had taken his bath as usual in the River Ga&#7751;&#7693;ak&#299; and was chanting his <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> he saw a pregnant deer come to the river to drink water. Suddenly there could be heard the thundering roar of a lion, and the deer was so frightened that it immediately gave birth to its calf. It then crossed the river, but died immediately thereafter. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata took compassion upon the motherless calf, rescued it from the water, took it to his <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama</span> and cared for it affectionately. He gradually became attached to this young deer and always thought of it affectionately. As it grew up, it became Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata&rsquo;s constant companion, and he always took care of it. Gradually he became so absorbed in thinking of this deer that his mind became agitated. As he became more attached to the deer, his devotional service slackened. Although he was able to give up his opulent kingdom, he became attached to the deer. Thus he fell down from his mystic <span class="Italic">yoga</span> practice. Once when the deer was absent, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata was so disturbed that he began to search for it. While searching and lamenting the deer&rsquo;s absence, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata fell down and died. Because his mind was fully absorbed thinking of the deer, he naturally took his next birth from the womb of a deer. However, because he was considerably advanced spiritually, he did not forget his past activities, even though he was in the body of a deer. He could understand how he had fallen down from his exalted position, and remembering this, he left his mother deer and again went to Pulaha-&#257;&#347;rama. He finally ended his fruitive activities in the form of a deer, and when he died he was released from the deer&rsquo;s body.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

If one is actually sympathetic to fallen, suffering humanity, he should try to elevate people from material consciousness to spiritual consciousness. As far as the deer was concerned, Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja became very sympathetic, but he forgot that it was impossible for him to elevate a deer to spiritual consciousness, because, after all, a deer is but an animal. It was very dangerous for Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja to sacrifice all his regulative principles simply to take care of an animal.

Material conditions are already established by the superior administration according to one&rsquo;s <span class="Italic">karma.</span> They cannot be changed. The only benefit we can render to suffering beings is to try to raise them to spiritual consciousness. Material comforts cannot be increased or decreased.

One should not bother for material activities. If one is at all sympathetic or able to do good to others, he should endeavor to raise people to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. In this way everyone advances spiritually by the grace of the Lord. For our instruction, Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja acted in such a way. We should be very careful not to be misled by so-called welfare activities conducted in bodily, terms. One should not give up his interest in attaining the favor of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u at any cost. Generally people do not know this, or they forget it. Consequently they sacrifice their original interest, the attainment of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&rsquo;s favor, and engage in philanthropic activities for bodily comfort.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Due to the fruitive results of his past deeds, he fell down from mystic yoga, austerity and worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If it were not due to his past fruitive activity, how could he have been attracted to the deer after giving up the association of his own son and family, considering them stumbling blocks on the path of spiritual life? How could he show such uncontrollable affection for a deer? This was definitely due to his past karma. The King was so engrossed in petting and maintaining the deer that he fell down from his spiritual activities.

In this regard, a question may be raised. How can a devotee be affected by his past misconduct and vicious activities? In <span class="Ref_Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> (5.54) it is said, <span class="Italic">karm&#257;&#7751;i nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bh&#257;j&#257;m:</span> &ldquo;For those engaged in devotional service, <span class="Italic">bhakti-bhajana,</span> the results of past deeds are indemnified.&rdquo; According to this, Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja could not be punished for his past misdeeds. The conclusion must be that Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata purposefully became over-addicted to the deer and neglected his spiritual advancement. To immediately rectify his mistake, for a short time he was awarded the body of a deer. This was just to increase his desire for mature devotional service. Although Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was awarded the body of an animal, he did not forget what had previously happened due to his purposeful mistake. He was very anxious to get out of his deer body, and this indicates that his affection for devotional service was intensified, so much so that he was quickly to attain perfection in a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> body in the next life. It is with this conviction that we declare in our <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> magazine that devotees like the <span class="Italic">gosv&#257;m&#299;s</span> living in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana who purposely commit some sinful activity are born in the bodies of dogs, monkeys and tortoises in that holy land.

However, due to his having been elevated to the topmost platform of devotional service, he did not forget the incidents of his past life. This special benediction saved him from further deterioration. Due to his past activities in devotional service, he became determined to finish his devotional service even in the body of a deer. It is therefore said in this verse, <span class="Italic">m&#7771;tam,</span> although he had died, <span class="Italic">anu,</span> afterwards, <span class="Italic">na m&#7771;ta janm&#257;nusm&#7771;tir itaravat,</span> he did not forget the incidents of his past life as others forget them.

Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata could remember the activities of his past life and how he was raised to the spiritual platform. Due to his foolishness, he became attached to an insignificant deer and thus fell down and had to accept the body of a deer. This is significant for every devotee. If we misuse our position and think that we are fully engaged in devotional service and can do whatever we like, we have to suffer like Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and be condemned to accept the type of body that impairs our devotional service. Only the human form is able to execute devotional service, but if we voluntarily give this up for sense gratification, we certainly have to be punished. This punishment is not exactly like that endured by an ordinary materialistic person. By the grace of the Supreme Lord, a devotee is punished in such a way that his eagerness to attain the lotus feet of Lord V&#257;sudeva is increased. By his intense desire, he returns home in the next lifetime. Devotional service is very completely described here: <span class="Italic">tad-anu&#347;rava&#7751;a-manana-sa&#7749;k&#299;rtan&#257;r&#257;dhan&#257;nusmaran&#257;bhiyogena.</span> The constant hearing and chanting of the glories of the Lord is recommended in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;:</span> <span class="Italic">satata&#7745; k&#299;rtayanto m&#257;&#7745; yatanta&#347; ca d&#7771;&#7693;ha-vrat&#257;&#7717;</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="index6a3d.html?g=3111">9.14</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> Those who have taken to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness should be very careful that not a single moment is wasted and that not a single moment is spent without chanting and remembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His activities. By His own actions and by the actions of His devotees, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a teaches us how to become cautious in devotional service. Through the medium of Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a teaches us that we must be careful in the discharge of devotional service. If we want to keep our minds completely fixed without deviation, we must engage them in devotional service full time. As far as the members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness are concerned, they have sacrificed everything to push on this K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement. Yet they must take a lesson from the life of Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja to be very cautious and to see that not a single moment is wasted in frivolous talk, sleep or voracious eating. Eating is not prohibited, but if we eat voraciously we shall certainly sleep more than required. Sense gratification ensues, and we may be degraded to a lower life form. In that way our spiritual progress may be checked at least for the time being. The best course is to take the advice of &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299;: <span class="Italic">avyartha-k&#257;latvam</I> [Cc.</I></span>Madhya <a href="indexa378.html?g=130049">23.18</a>-19]<span class="Italic">.</span> <span class="Italic">We</span> should see that every moment of our lives is utilized for the rendering of devotional service and nothing else.

In this body he remained like one dull, deaf and dumb, so much so that when he was brought before the goddess K&#257;l&#299; to be killed as a sacrifice, he never protested but remained silent. After having given up the body of a deer, he took birth in the womb of the youngest wife of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> In this life he could also remember the activities of his past life, and in order to avoid the influence of society, he remained like a deaf and dumb person. He was very careful not to fall down again. He did not mix with anyone who was not a devotee. This process should be adopted by every devotee. As advised by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu: <span class="Italic">asat-sa&#7749;ga-ty&#257;ga&mdash;ei vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-&#257;c&#257;ra.</span> One should strictly avoid the company of nondevotees, even though they may be family members. When Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was in the body of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> the people in the neighborhood thought of him as a crazy, dull fellow, but within he was always chanting and remembering V&#257;sudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although his father wanted to give him an education and purify him as a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> by offering him the sacred thread, he remained in such a way that his father and mother could understand that he was crazy and not interested in the reformatory method. Nonetheless, he remained fully K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious, even without undergoing such official ceremonies. Due to his silence, some people who were no better than animals began to tease him in many ways, but he tolerated this. After the death of his father and mother, his stepmother and stepbrothers began to treat him very poorly. They would give him the most condemned food, but still he did not mind; he remained completely absorbed in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. He was ordered by his stepbrothers and mother to guard a paddy field one night, and at that time the leader of a dacoit party took him away and tried to kill him by offering him as a sacrifice before Bhadra K&#257;l&#299;. When the dacoits brought Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja before the goddess K&#257;l&#299; and raised a chopper to kill him, the goddess K&#257;l&#299; became immediately alarmed due to the mistreatment of a devotee. She came out of the deity and, taking the chopper in her own hands, killed all the dacoits there. Thus a pure devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can remain silent despite the mistreatment of nondevotees. Rogues and dacoits who misbehave toward a devotee are punished at last by the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

He remained always in a trance. He had nine equally qualified sons by his first wife, and by his second wife he begot twins&mdash;a brother and a sister, of which the male child was said to be the topmost devotee and foremost of saintly kings&mdash;Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja.

He never ate anything for sense gratification because he was already liberated from the bodily conception, which induces one to accept palatable or unpalatable food. He was full in the transcendental consciousness of devotional service, and therefore he was unaffected by the dualities arising from the bodily conception. Actually his body was as strong as a bull&rsquo;s, and his limbs were very muscular. He didn&rsquo;t care for winter or summer, wind or rain, and he never covered his body at any time. He lay on the ground, and never smeared oil on his body or took a bath. Because his body was dirty, his spiritual effulgence and knowledge were covered, just as the splendor of a valuable gem is covered by dirt. He only wore a dirty loincloth and his sacred thread, which was blackish. Understanding that he was born in a br&#257;hma&#7751;a family, people would call him a brahma-bandhu and other names.

They fed him sumptuously and then brought him before the goddess K&#257;l&#299;, offering her incense, lamps, garlands, parched grain, newly grown twigs, sprouts, fruits and flowers.

According to the Vedic <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras,</span> everything must be done according to regulative principles, but here it is stated that the thieves and rogues devised their own process for killing an animalistic man. The tamasic <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> give instructions for the sacrifice of an animal like a goat or buffalo before the goddess K&#257;l&#299;, but there is no mention of killing a man, however dull he may be. This process was manufactured by the dacoits themselves; therefore the word <span class="Italic">sva-vidhin&#257;</span> is used. Even at this time there are many sacrifices being conducted without reference to the Vedic scriptures. For instance, in Calcutta recently a slaughterhouse was being advertised as a temple of the goddess K&#257;l&#299;. Meat-eaters foolishly purchase meat from such shops, thinking it different from ordinary meat and taking it to be the <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da</span> of goddess K&#257;l&#299;. The sacrifice of a goat or a similar animal before the goddess K&#257;l&#299; is mentioned in <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> just to keep people from eating slaughterhouse meat and becoming responsible for the killing of animals. The conditioned soul has a natural tendency toward sex and meat-eating; consequently the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> grant them some concessions. Actually the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> aim at putting an end to these abominable activities, but they impart some regulative principles so that gradually meat-eaters and sex hunters will be rectified.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

were low minded and bound to the modes of passion and ignorance. They were overpowered by the desire to become very rich; therefore they had the audacity to disobey the injunctions of the Vedas, so much so that they were prepared to kill Ja&#7693;a Bharata, a self-realized soul born in a br&#257;hma&#7751;a family. Due to their envy, these dacoits brought him before the goddess K&#257;l&#299; for sacrifice. Such people are always addicted to envious activities, and therefore they dared to try to kill Ja&#7693;a Bharata. Ja&#7693;a Bharata was the best friend of all living entities. He was no one&rsquo;s enemy, and he was always absorbed in meditation on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He was born of a good br&#257;hma&#7751;a father, and killing him was forbidden, even though he might have been an enemy or aggressive person. In any case, there was no reason to kill Ja&#7693;a Bharata, and the goddess K&#257;l&#299; could not bear this. She could immediately understand that these sinful dacoits were about to kill a great devotee of the Lord. Suddenly the deity&rsquo;s body burst asunder, and the goddess K&#257;l&#299; personally emerged from it in a body burning with an intense and intolerable effulgence.</div><A NAME="69385"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="69386"></A><div class="First">According to the Vedic injunctions, only an aggressor can be killed. If a person comes with an intent to kill, one can immediately take action and kill in self-defense. It is also stated that one can be killed if he comes to set fire to the home or to pollute or kidnap one&rsquo;s wife. Lord R&#257;macandra killed the entire family of R&#257;va&#7751;a because R&#257;va&#7751;a kidnapped His wife, S&#299;t&#257;dev&#299;. However, killing is not sanctioned in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> for other purposes. The killing of animals in sacrifice to the demigods, who are expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is sanctioned for those who eat meat. This is a kind of restriction for meat-eating. In other words, the slaughter of animals is also restricted by certain rules and regulations in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> Considering these points, there was no reason to kill Ja&#7693;a Bharata, who was born in a respectable, highly exalted <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> family. He was a God-realized soul and a well-wisher to all living entities. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> did not at all sanction the killing of Ja&#7693;a Bharata by rogues and thieves. Consequently the goddess Bhadra K&#257;l&#299; emerged from the deity to give protection to the Lord&rsquo;s devotee. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura explains that due to the Brahman effulgence of such a devotee as Ja&#7693;a Bharata, the deity was fractured. Only thieves and rogues in the modes of passion and ignorance and maddened by material opulence offer a man in sacrifice before the goddess K&#257;l&#299;. This is not sanctioned by the Vedic instructions. Presently there are many hundreds and thousands of slaughterhouses throughout the world that are maintained by a puffed-up population mad for material opulence. Such activities are never supported by the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata</span> school.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The King forced Ja&#7693;a Bharata to carry his palanquin and chastised him because he did not carry it properly. A carrier of King Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a&rsquo;s palanquin was needed, and to fulfill this need the chief carriers found Ja&#7693;a Bharata as the most likely person to do the work. He was therefore forced to carry the palanquin. Ja&#7693;a Bharata, however, did not protest this proud order, but humbly accepted the job and carried the palanquin. While carrying it, however, he was very careful to see that he did not step on an ant, and whenever he saw one, he would stop until the ant had passed. Because of this, he could not keep pace with the other carriers. The King within the palanquin became very disturbed and chastised Ja&#7693;a Bharata with filthy language, but Ja&#7693;a Bharata, being completely freed from the bodily conception, did not protest; he proceeded carrying the palanquin. When he continued as before, the King threatened him with punishment, and being threatened by the King, Ja&#7693;a Bharata began to talk. He protested against the filthy language used by the King when the King chastised him, and the King, hearing the instructions of Ja&#7693;a Bharata, was awakened to his real knowledge. When he came to his consciousness, he understood that he had offended a great, learned and saintly person. At that time he very humbly and respectfully prayed to Ja&#7693;a Bharata.

Due to this, the palanquin was shaking, and King Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a immediately asked the carriers, &ldquo;Why are you carrying this palanquin unevenly? Better carry it properly.&rdquo;</div><A NAME="69443"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="69444"></A><div class="First">Although Ja&#7693;a Bharata was forced to carry the palanquin, he did not give up his sympathetic feelings toward the poor ants passing on the road. A devotee of the Lord does not forget his devotional service and other favorable activities, even when he is in a most distressful condition. Ja&#7693;a Bharata was a qualified <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> highly elevated in spiritual knowledge, yet he was forced to carry the palanquin. He did not mind this, but while walking on the road, he could not forget his duty to avoid killing even an ant. A Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is never envious or unnecessarily violent. There were many ants on the path, but Ja&#7693;a Bharata took care by looking ahead three feet. When the ants were no longer in his way, he would place his foot on the ground. A Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is always very kind at heart to all living entities. In His <span class="Italic">s&#257;&#7749;khya-yoga,</span> Lord Kapiladeva explains: <span class="Italic">suh&#7771;da&#7717; sarva-dehin&#257;m.</span> Living entities assume different bodily forms. Those who are not Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas consider only human society worthy of their sympathy, but K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a claims to be the supreme father of all life forms. Consequently the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava takes care not to annihilate untimely or unnecessarily any life form. All living entities have to fulfill a certain duration for being encaged in a particular type of material body. They have to finish the duration allotted a particular body before being promoted or evolved to another body. Killing an animal or any other living being simply places an impediment in the way of his completing his term of imprisonment in a certain body. One should therefore not kill bodies for one&rsquo;s sense gratification, for this will implicate one in sinful activity.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

He was neither fat, lean nor thin, nor had he anything to do with a lump of matter, a combination of the five gross and three subtle elements. He had nothing to do with the material body and its two hands and legs. In other words, he had completely realized his spiritual identity [].

Although considering himself very learned, the King did not know about the position of an advanced devotee situated in devotional service, nor did he know his characteristics. Ja&#7693;a Bharata was the residence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; he always carried the form of the Lord within his heart.

We have several examples of this in Vedic literature. Once N&#257;rada became angry with the two sons of Kuvera, Nalak&#363;vara and Ma&#7751;igr&#299;va, and he chastised them by turning them into trees. The result was that later they were liberated by Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.

But in course of time the succession was broken, and therefore the science as it is appears to be lost.&rdquo;</div><A NAME="69612"></A><div class="Purport">Through the disciplic succession the royal order was on the same platform as great saintly persons (<span class="Italic">r&#257;ja-&#7771;&#7779;is</span>). Formerly they could understand the philosophy of life and knew how to train the citizens to come to the same standard. In other words, they knew how to deliver the citizens from the entanglement of birth and death. When Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Da&#347;aratha ruled Ayodhy&#257;, the great sage Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra once came to him to take away Lord R&#257;macandra and Lak&#7779;ma&#7751;a to the forest to kill a demon. When the saintly person Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra came to the court of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Da&#347;aratha, the King, in order to receive the saintly person, asked him, <span class="Italic">aihi&#7779;&#7789;a&#7745; yat tat punar janma jay&#257;ya.</span> He asked the sage whether everything was going on well in his endeavor to conquer the repetition of birth and death. The whole process of Vedic civilization is based on this point. We must know how to conquer the repetition of birth and death. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a also knew the purpose of life; therefore when Ja&#7693;a Bharata put the philosophy of life before him, he immediately appreciated it. This is the foundation of Vedic society. Learned scholars, <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> saintly persons and sages who were fully aware of the Vedic purpose advised the royal order how to benefit the general masses, and by their cooperation, the general masses were benefited. Therefore everything was successful. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a attained this perfection of understanding the value of human life; therefore he regretted his insulting words to Ja&#7693;a Bharata, and he immediately descended from his palanquin and fell down at the lotus feet of Ja&#7693;a Bharata in order to be excused and to hear from him further about the values of life known as <span class="Italic">brahma jij&ntilde;&#257;s&#257;</span> (inquiry into the Absolute Truth). At the present moment, high government officials are ignorant of the values of life, and when saintly persons endeavor to broadcast the Vedic knowledge, the so-called executives do not offer their respectful obeisances but try to obstruct the spiritual propaganda. Thus one can say that the former kingly government was like heaven and that the present government is like hell.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Sometimes it is very risky to give great philosophical instructions to ordinary people, but &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, for the benefit of the fallen souls of Kali-yuga, has given us a very nice instrument, the chanting of the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> The general mass of people, although <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> and less, can be purified by chanting this Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> Then they can understand the exalted philosophical statements of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> Our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement has therefore adopted the chanting of the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra</span> for the general masses.

By punishing them, he teaches the citizens to obey the laws of the state. Again, you have said that punishing a person who is deaf and dumb is like chewing the chewed or grinding the pulp; that is to say, there is no benefit in it. However, if one is engaged in his own occupational duty as ordered by the Supreme Lord, his sinful activities are certainly diminished.

Our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement aims at engaging people in Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s service. That will help them become freed from all material contamination and sinful activity.

This would be very beneficial for everyone. Unfortunately the king or president engages people in sense gratification instead of the Lord&rsquo;s service, and such activities are certainly not beneficial for anyone. King Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a tried to engage Ja&#7693;a Bharata in carrying the palanquin, which is a form of sense gratification for the King. However, if one is engaged as a palanquin carrier in the Lord&rsquo;s service, that is certainly beneficial. In this godless civilization, if a president engages people somehow or other in devotional service or the awakening of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, he renders the very best service to the citizens.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

He tells the King: &ldquo;You are not very experienced, yet you pose yourself as a learned person because you are very proud of your knowledge. Actually a person who is on the transcendental platform does not care for social behavior that sacrifices spiritual advancement. Social behavior comes within the jurisdiction of <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a,</span> material benefit. No one can spiritually advance by such activities. The conditioned soul is always overpowered by the modes of material nature. and consequently he is simply concerned with material benefits and auspicious and inauspicious material things. In other words, the mind, which is the leader of the senses, is absorbed in material activities life after life. Thus he continuously gets different types of bodies and suffers miserable material conditions. On the basis of mental concoction, social behavior has been formulated. If one&rsquo;s mind is absorbed in these activities, he certainly remains conditioned within the material world. According to different opinions, there are eleven or twelve mental activities, which can be transformed into hundreds and thousands. A person who is not K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious is subjected to all these mental concoctions and is thus governed by the material energy. The living entity who is free from mental concoctions attains the platform of pure spirit soul, devoid of material contamination. There are two types of living entities&mdash;<span class="Italic">j&#299;v&#257;tm&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">Param&#257;tm&#257;,</span> the individual soul and the Supreme Soul. That Supreme Soul in His ultimate realization is Lord V&#257;sudeva, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. He enters into everyone&rsquo;s heart and controls the living entity in his different activities. He is therefore the supreme shelter of all living entities. One can understand the Supreme Soul and one&rsquo;s position in relationship with Him when one is completely freed from the unwanted association of ordinary men. In this way one can become fit to cross the ocean of nescience. The cause of conditional Life is attachment to the external energy. One has to conquer these mental concoctions: unless one does so, he will never be freed from material anxieties. Although mental concoctions have no value, their influence is still very formidable. No one should neglect to control the mind. If one does, the mind becomes so powerful that one immediately forgets his real position. Forgetting that he is an eternal servant of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and that service to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is his only business, one is doomed by material nature to serve the objects of the senses.

Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a was bitten by the serpent of ignorance, but was cured by the nectarean words of Ja&#7693;a Bharata. Later, because he was doubtful about the subjects discussed, he made further inquiries, one question after another.

Therefore Ja&#7693;a Bharata repeated his instructions more clearly. He said that on the surface of the globe all living entities, moving and unmoving, were but transformations of the earth in different ways. The King was very proud of his king&rsquo;s body, but that body was simply another transformation of the earth. Out of his false prestige, the King was misbehaving toward the palanquin carrier. as a master toward a servant, and he was actually very unkind to other living entities. Consequently King Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a was unfit to give protection to the citizens, and because he was ignorant, he was unfit to be counted among advanced philosophers. Everything in the material world is but a transformation of the earth, although things have different names according to their transformations. Actually the varieties are one and the same, and ultimately all these varieties are vanquished into atoms. Nothing is permanent in this material world. The variety of things and their distinctions are simply mental concoctions. The Absolute Truth is beyond illusion and is manifest in three features&mdash;impersonal Brahman, localized Param&#257;tm&#257; and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Ultimate realization of the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, called V&#257;sudeva by His devotees.

For some reason, these move on the surface of the earth and are called palanquin carriers. Those material transformations which do not move are gross material objects like stones. In any case, the material body is made of earth and stone in the form of feet, ankles, calves, knees, thighs, torso, throat and head. Upon the shoulders is the wooden palanquin, and within the palanquin is the so-called King of Sauv&#299;ra. The body of the King is simply another transformation of earth, but within that body Your Lordship is situated and falsely thinking that you are the King of the state of Sauv&#299;ra.</div><A NAME="70110"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="70111"></A><div class="First">After analyzing the material bodies of the palanquin carrier and the palanquin passenger, Ja&#7693;a Bharata concludes that the real living force is the living entity. The living entity is the offshoot or offspring of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u; therefore within this material world, among moving and nonmoving things, the real principle is Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Due to His presence, everything is working, and there are actions and reactions. One who understands Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u as the original cause of everything is to be understood to be perfectly situated in knowledge. Although he was falsely proud of being a king, King Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a was not really situated in knowledge. Therefore he was rebuking the palanquin carriers, including the self-realized <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> Ja&#7693;a Bharata. This is the first accusation Ja&#7693;a Bharata made against the King, who was daring to talk to a learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> from the flimsy ground of ignorance, identifying everything with matter. King Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a argued that the living entity is within the body and that when the body is fatigued the living entity within must therefore be suffering. It is clearly explained in the following verses that the living entity does not suffer due to the body&rsquo;s fatigue. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; gives an example of a child heavily decorated with ornaments; although the child&rsquo;s body is very delicate, he does not feel fatigue, nor do the parents think that his ornaments should be taken away. The living entity has nothing to do with bodily pains and pleasures. These are simply mental concoctions. An intelligent man will find the original cause of everything. Material combinations and permutations may be a matter of fact in worldly dealings, but actually the living force, the soul, has nothing to do with them. Those who are materially upset take care of the body and manufacture <span class="Italic">daridra-n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</span> (poor N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a). However, it is not a fact that the soul or Supersoul becomes poor simply because the body is poor. These are the statements of ignorant people. The soul and Supersoul are always apart from bodily pleasure and pain.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

When we can understand by an analytical study that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of all causes, our knowledge is perfect. Simply understanding the transformations of different energies is partial knowledge. We must come to the ultimate cause. <span class="Italic">Na te vidu&#7717; sv&#257;rtha gati&#7745; hi vi&#7779;&#7751;um</I> [SB </span></I><a href="index2706.html?g=55424">7.5.31</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> The knowledge of those who are not interested in knowing the original cause of all emanations is never perfect knowledge. There is nothing in the phenomenal world that is not produced by the supreme energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Aromas from the earth are different scents manufactured and used for different purposes, but the original cause is the earth, nothing else. A waterpot made of earth can be used to carry water for some time, but ultimately the pot is nothing but earth. Therefore there is no difference between the pot and its original ingredient, earth. It is simply a different transformation of the energy. Originally the cause or primary ingredient is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the varieties are only by-products.

If we understand K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the original cause of everything, we do not need to separately study the subsidiary varieties. Therefore from the very beginning it is said: <span class="Italic">satya&#7745; para&#7745; dh&#299;mahi.</span> One has to concentrate one&rsquo;s understanding on the Supreme Truth, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a or V&#257;sudeva.

He explained that this material world is like a great forest in which one becomes entangled due to association with material life. In this forest there are plunderers (the six senses) as well as carnivorous animals like jackals, wolves and lions (wife, children and other relatives) who are always anxious to suck the blood from the head of the family. The forest plunderers and the carnivorous blood-sucking animals combine to exploit the energy of a man within this material world. In this forest there is also a black hole, covered by grass, into which one may fall. Coming into the forest and being captivated by so many material attractions, one identifies himself with this material world, society, friendship, love and family. Having lost the path and not knowing where to go, being harassed by animals and birds, one is also victimized by many desires. Thus one works very hard within the forest and wanders here and there. He becomes captivated by temporary happiness and becomes aggrieved by so-called distress. Actually one simply suffers in the forest from so-called happiness and distress. Sometimes he is attacked by a snake (deep sleep), and due to the snakebite he loses consciousness and becomes puzzled and bewildered about discharging his duties. Sometimes he is attracted by women other than his wife, and thus be thinks he enjoys extramarital love with another woman. He is attacked by various diseases, by lamentation and by summer and winter. Thus one within the forest of the material world suffers the pains of material existence. Expecting to become happy, the living entity changes his position from one place to another, but actually a materialistic person within the material world is never happy. Being constantly engaged in materialistic activities, he is always disturbed. He forgets that one day he has to die. Although he suffers severely, being illusioned by the material energy, he still hankers after material happiness. In this way he completely forgets his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div></div><A NAME="70278"></A><div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level"><TB>By hearing this from Ja&#7693;a Bharata, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a revived his K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness and thus benefited from Ja&#7693;a Bharata&rsquo;s association.

His happiness may last for a few years, but because the owner of the castle has to leave the castle at the time of death, everything is eventually lost. This is the way of worldly transactions. Such happiness is described by Vidy&#257;pati as the happiness one derives upon seeing a drop of water in the desert. The desert is heated by scorching sunshine, and if we want to reduce the desert temperature, we need huge amounts of water&mdash;millions and millions of gallons. What effect will one drop have? Water certainly has value, but one drop of water cannot reduce the heat of the desert. In this material world everyone is ambitious, but the heat is very scorching. What will an imaginary castle in the air do to help? &#346;r&#299;la Vidy&#257;pati has therefore sung: <span class="Italic">t&#257;&#7789;ala saikate, v&#257;ri-bindu-sama, suta-mita-rama&#7751;i-sam&#257;je.</span> The happiness of family life, friends and society is compared to a drop of water in the scorching desert. The entire material world is busy trying to attain happiness because happiness is the prerogative of the living being. Unfortunately, due to falling in contact with the material world, the living entity simply struggles for existence. Even if one becomes happy for a while, a very powerful enemy may plunder everything. There are many instances in which big businessmen suddenly become paupers in the street. Yet the nature of material existence is such that foolish people are attracted to these transactions and they forget the real business of self-realization.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The International Society for Krishna Consciousness is therefore constructing a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-Balar&#257;ma temple to invite its members as well as outsiders to come and live peacefully in a spiritual atmosphere. That will help one become elevated to the transcendental world and return home, back to Godhead. Another sentence in this verse is very significant: <span class="Italic">kau&#7789;umbika&#7717; krudhyati vai jan&#257;ya.</span> When one&rsquo;s mind is disturbed in so many ways, he satisfies himself by becoming angry with his poor wife and children. The wife and children are naturally dependent on the father, but the father, being unable to maintain the family properly, becomes mentally distressed and therefore chastises the family members unnecessarily. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (12.2.9): <span class="Italic">&#257;cchinna-d&#257;ra-dravi&#7751;&#257; y&#257;syanti giri-k&#257;nanam.</span> Being disgusted with family life, one separates from the family by divorce or some other means. If one has to separate, why not separate willingly? Systematic separation is better than forced separation. Forced separation cannot make anyone happy, but by mutual consent or by the Vedic arrangement one must separate from his family affairs at a certain age and fully depend on K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. This makes one&rsquo;s life successful.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

By bribing others, one may secure another woman for enjoyment, yet another debauchee may kidnap her or offer her something better. This woman hunting is going on in the forest of the material world, sometimes legally, and sometimes illegally. Consequently in this K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement the devotees are forbidden to have illicit sex. Thus they avoid so many difficulties.

Due to the material body, his senses were certainly agitated when he was insulted by King Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a, but later, due to the King&rsquo;s humble submission, Ja&#7693;a Bharata excused him. It is the duty of everyone desiring to return to Godhead to become submissive like King Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a and beg pardon of Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas one may have offended. Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas are generally very kindhearted; therefore if one immediately submits himself at the lotus feet of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, one is immediately cleared of offensive reactions. If one does not do so, the reactions will remain, and the results will not be very palatable.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td><td width="90%"><A NAME="70652"></A><A NAME="70653"></A><div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The direct meaning of the forest of material existence is given in this chapter. Merchants sometimes enter the forest to collect many rare things and sell them at a good profit in the city, but the forest path is always bedecked with dangers. When the pure soul wants to give up the Lord&rsquo;s service to enjoy the material world, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a certainly gives him a chance to enter the material world. As stated in the <I>P</I><span class="Italic">rema-vivarta:</span> <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-bahirmukha ha&ntilde;&#257; bhoga v&#257;&ntilde;ch&#257; kare.</span> This is the reason the pure spirit soul falls down to the material world. Due to his activities under the influence of the three modes of material nature, the living entity takes different positions in different species. Sometimes he is a demigod in the heavenly planets and sometimes a most insignificant creature in the lower planetary systems. In this regard, &#346;r&#299;la Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura says, <span class="Italic">n&#257;n&#257; yoni sad&#257; phire:</span> the living entity passes through various species. <span class="Italic">Kardarya bhak&#7779;a&#7751;a kare:</span> he is obliged to eat and enjoy abominable things. <span class="Italic">T&#257;ra janma adha&#7717;-p&#257;te y&#257;ya:</span> in this way his whole life is spoiled. Without the protection of an all-merciful Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. the conditioned soul cannot get out of the clutches of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">mana&#7717; &#7779;a&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;n&#299;ndriy&#257;&#7751;i prak&#7771;ti-sth&#257;ni kar&#7779;ati  </I>[Bg.<B> </B></I></span><a href="index6669.html?g=4886">15.7</a>]), the living entity begins material life with his mind and the five knowledge-acquiring senses, and with these he struggles for existence within the material world. These senses are compared to rogues and thieves within the forest. They take away a man&rsquo;s knowledge and place him in a network of nescience. Thus the senses are like rogues and thieves that plunder his spiritual knowledge. Over and above this, there are family members, wife and children. who are exactly like ferocious animals in the forest. The business of such ferocious animals is to eat a man&rsquo;s flesh. The living entity allows himself to be attacked by jackals and foxes (wife and children), and thus his real spiritual life is finished. In the forest of material life, everyone is envious like mosquitoes, and rats and mice are always creating disturbances. Everyone in this material world is placed in many awkward positions and surrounded by envious people and disturbing animals. The result is that the living entity in the material world is always plundered and bitten by many living entities. Nonetheless, despite these disturbances, he does not want to give up his family life, and he continues his fruitive activities in an attempt to become happy in the future. He thus becomes more and more entangled in the results of <span class="Italic">karma,</span> and thus he is forced to act impiously. His witnesses are the sun during the day and the moon during the night. The demigods also witness, but the conditioned soul thinks that his attempts at sense gratification are not being witnessed by anyone. Sometimes, when he is detected, he temporarily renounces everything, but due to his great attachment for the body, his renunciation is given up before he can attain perfection.</div></div><A NAME="70654"></A><div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level"><TB>In this material world there are many envious people. There is the tax-exacting government, which is compared to an owl, and there are invisible crickets that create unbearable sounds. The conditioned soul is certainly greatly harassed by the agents of material nature, but his intelligence is lost due to undesirable association. In an attempt to gain relief from the disturbances of material existence, he falls victim to so-called <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s, s&#257;dhus</span> and incarnations who can display some magic but who do not understand devotional service. Sometimes the conditioned soul is bereft of all money, and consequently he becomes unkind to his family members. In this material world there is not a pinch of actual happiness, for which the conditioned soul is longing life after life. The government officials are like carnivorous R&#257;k&#7779;asas who exact heavy taxes for the maintenance of the government. The hard-working conditioned soul is very saddened due to these heavy taxes.</div></div><A NAME="70655"></A><div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level"><TB>The path of fruitive activities leads to difficult mountains, and sometimes the conditioned soul wants to cross these mountains, but he is never successful, and consequently he becomes more and more aggrieved and disappointed. Becoming materially and financially embarrassed, the conditioned soul unnecessarily chastises his family. In the material condition there are four principal needs, out of which sleep is compared to a python. When asleep, the conditioned soul completely forgets his real existence, and in sleep he does not feel the tribulations of material life. Sometimes, being in need of money, the conditioned soul steals and cheats, although he may apparently be associated with devotees for spiritual advancement. His only business is getting out of the clutches of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;, but</span> due to improper guidance he becomes more and more entangled in material dealings. This material world is simply an embarrassment and is composed of tribulations presented as happiness. distress, attachment, enmity and envy. On the whole it is simply full of tribulation and misery. When a person loses his intelligence due to attachment to wife and sex, his entire consciousness becomes polluted. He thus only thinks of the association of women. The time factor, which is like a serpent, takes away everyone&rsquo;s life, including that of Lord Brahm&#257; and the insignificant ant. Sometimes the conditioned soul tries to save himself from inexorable time and thus takes shelter of some bogus savior. Unfortunately. the bogus savior cannot even save himself. How, then. can he protect others? The bogus saviors do not care for bona fide knowledge received from qualified <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and Vedic sources. Their only business is indulging in sex and recommending sexual freedom even for widows. Thus they are like monkeys in the forest. &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; thus explains the material forest and its difficult path to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

about the direct meaning of the material forest, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; replied as follows: My dear King, a man belonging to the mercantile community [va&#7751;ik] is always interested in earning money. Sometimes he enters the forest to acquire some cheap commodities like wood and earth and sell them in the city at good prices. Similarly, the conditioned soul, being greedy, enters this material world for some material profit. Gradually he enters the deepest part of the forest, not really knowing how to get out. Having entered the material world, the pure soul becomes conditioned by the material atmosphere, which is created by the external energy under the control of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Thus the living entity comes under the control of the external energy, daiv&#299; m&#257;y&#257;. Living independently and bewildered in the forest, he does not attain the association of devotees who are always engaged in the service of the Lord. Once in the bodily conception, he gets different types of bodies one after the other under the influence of material energy and impelled by the modes of material nature [sattva-gu&#7751;a, rajo-gu&#7751;a and tamo-gu&#7751;a]. In this way the conditioned soul goes sometimes to the heavenly planets, sometimes to the earthly planets and sometimes to the lower planets and lower species. Thus he suffers continuously due to different types of bodies. These sufferings and pains are sometimes mixed. Sometimes they are very severe, and sometimes they are not. These bodily conditions are acquired due to the conditioned soul&rsquo;s mental speculation. He uses his mind and five senses to acquire knowledge, and these bring about the different bodies and different conditions. Using the senses under the control of the external energy, m&#257;y&#257;, the living entity suffers the miserable conditions of material existence. He is actually searching for relief, but he is generally baffled, although sometimes he is relieved after great difficulty. Struggling for existence in this way, he cannot get the shelter of pure devotees, who are like bumblebees engaged in loving service at the lotus feet of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u.</div><A NAME="70666"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="70667"></A><div class="First">The most important information in this verse is <span class="Italic">hari-guru-cara&#7751;a-aravinda-madhukara-anupadav&#299;m.</span> In this material world the conditioned souls are baffled by their activities, and sometimes they are relieved after great difficulty. On the whole the conditioned soul is never happy. He simply struggles for existence. Actually his only business is to accept the spiritual master, the <span class="Italic">guru,</span> and through him he must accept the lotus feet or the Lord. This is explained by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu: <span class="Italic">guru-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-pras&#257;de p&#257;ya bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja.</span> people struggling for existence in the forests or cities of the material world are not actually enjoying life.

In this way he can get out of the struggle.</div><A NAME="70670"></A><div class="Purport">Since the material world is compared herein to a forest, it may be argued that in Kali-yuga modern civilization is mainly situated in the cities. A great city, however, is like a great forest. Actually city life is more dangerous than life in the forest. If one enters an unknown city without friend or shelter, living in that city is more difficult than living in a forest. There are many big cities all over the surface of the globe, and wherever one looks he sees the struggle for existence going on twenty-four hours a day. people rush about in cars going seventy and eighty miles an hour, constantly coming and going, and this sets the scene of the great struggle for existence. One has to rise early in the morning and travel in that car at breakneck speed. There is always the danger of an accident, and one has to take great care. In his automobile, the living entity is full of anxieties, and his struggle is not at all auspicious. Apart from human beings, other species like cats and dogs are also struggling very hard day and night for existence. Thus the struggle for existence continues, and the conditioned soul changes from one position to another. For a while, he is a child, but he has to become a boy. From a boy, he has to change into a youth, and from youth to manhood and old age. Finally, when the body is no longer workable, he has to accept a new body in a different species. Giving up the body is called death, and accepting another body is called birth. The human form is an opportunity to take shelter of the bona fide spiritual master and, through him, the Supreme Lord. This K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement has been started to give an opportunity to all the members of human society, who are misled by foolish leaders. No one can get out of this struggle for existence, which is full of miseries, without accepting a pure devotee of the Lord. The material attempt changes from one position to another, and no one actually gains relief from the struggle for existence. The only resort is the lotus feet of a bona fide spiritual master, and, through him, the lotus feet of the Lord.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

One should practice a little austerity and not spend money on anything other than the regulative life of devotional service. The senses demand that one see beautiful things; therefore money should be spent for decorating the Deity in the temple. Similarly, the tongue has to taste good food, which should be bought and offered to the Deity. The nose can be utilized in smelling the flowers offered to the Deity, and the hearing can be utilized by listening to the vibration of the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> In this way the senses can be regulated and utilized to advance K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness.

One spoils an opulent position in the material world by driving cars, spending time in nightclubs or tasting abominable food in restaurants.

Under these circumstances, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in everyone&rsquo;s heart, compassionately takes away all the material possessions of such a devotee.

When everything is taken away, the devotee feels helpless and frustrated in society, friendship and love. He feels that his family does not care for him any longer, and he therefore completely surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord. This is a special favor granted by the Lord to a devotee who cannot fully surrender to the Lord due to a strong bodily conception. As explained in <span class="Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Madhya</span> <a href="index6df2.html?g=128974">22.39</a>): <span class="Italic">&#257;mi&mdash;vij&ntilde;a, ei m&#363;rkhe &lsquo;vi&#7779;aya&rsquo; kene diba.</span> The Lord understands the devotee who hesitates to engage in the Lord&rsquo;s service, not knowing whether he should again try to revive his material life.

Unless one is liberated from material conditioning, these four defects must be there. Consequently every man has a cheating propensity, which is employed in business or money transactions. Although two friends may be living peacefully together, due to their propensity to cheat they become enemies when there is a transaction between them. A philosopher accuses an economist of being a cheater, and an economist may accuse a philosopher of being a cheater when he comes in contact with money. In any case, this is the condition of material life. One may profess a high philosophy, but when one is in need of money, he becomes a cheater. In this material world, so-called scientists, philosophers and economists are nothing but cheaters in one way or another. The scientists are cheaters because they present so many bogus things in the name of science. They propose going to the moon, but actually they end up cheating the entire public of large sums of money for their experiments. They cannot do anything useful. Unless one can find a person transcendental to the four basic defects, one should not accept advice and become a victim of the material condition. The best process is to take the advice and instructions of &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a or His bona fide representative.

Again, he becomes very busy under the shelter of that home and is captivated by the talks, glances and activities of his wife and children.

The word <span class="Italic">bhuja-lat&#257;-upag&#363;&#7693;ha,</span> meaning &ldquo;being embraced by beautiful arms which are compared to creepers,&rdquo; describes the way the conditioned soul is bound within this material world.

Thus one changes from infancy, to childhood, to youth and maturity, and thus one approaches the end of life. It is impossible to check this wheel of time. This wheel is very exacting because it is the personal weapon of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sometimes the conditioned soul, fearing the approach of death, wants to worship someone who can save him from imminent danger. Yet he does not care for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose weapon is the indefatigable time factor. The conditioned soul instead takes shelter of a man-made god described in unauthorized scriptures. Such gods are like buzzards, vultures, herons and crows. Vedic scriptures do not refer to them. Imminent death is like the attack of a lion, and neither vultures, buzzards, crows nor herons can save one from such an attack.

Yet somehow or other, the King became affectionate to a little deer and, falling from his position, had to accept the body of a deer in his next life. Due to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s great mercy upon him, he could not forget his position, and he could understand how he had fallen. Therefore in the next life, as Ja&#7693;a Bharata, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata was careful not to spoil his energy, and therefore he presented himself as a deaf and dumb person. In this way he could concentrate on his devotional service. We have to learn from the great King Bharata how to become cautious in cultivating K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. A little inattention will retard our devotional service for the time being.

The merchant is the living entity who comes to the forest of material existence to try to make money for sense gratification.

Everything belongs to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but due to our perverted mind and senses. we plunder the property of the Lord and engage in satisfying our senses. The jackals and tigers in the forest are our family members, and the herbs and creepers are our material desires. The mountain cave is our happy home, and the mosquitoes and serpents are our enemies. The rats, beasts and vultures are different types of thieves who take away our possessions, and the <span class="Italic">gandharva-pura</span> is the phantasmagoria of the body and home. The will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp is our attraction for gold and its color, and material residence and wealth are the ingredients for our material enjoyment. The whirlwind is our attraction for our wife, and the dust storm is our blinding passion experienced during sex. The demigods control the different directions, and the cricket is the harsh words spoken by our enemy during our absence. The owl is the person who directly insults us, and the impious trees are impious men. The waterless river represents atheists who give us trouble in this world and the next. The meat-eating demons are the government officials, and the pricking thorns are the impediments of material life. The little taste experienced in sex is our desire to enjoy another&rsquo;s wife, and the flies are the guardians of women, like the husband, father-in-law, mother-in-law and so forth. The creeper itself is women in general. The lion is the wheel of time, and the herons, crows and vultures are so-called demigods, pseudo <span class="Italic">sv&#257;m&#299;s, yog&#299;s</span> and incarnations.

Some people mistakenly thought Sumati to be the direct incarnation of Lord Buddha. The son of Sumati was Devat&#257;jit, and his son was Devadyumna. Devadyumna&rsquo;s son was Parame&#7779;&#7789;h&#299;, and his son was Prat&#299;ha. Prat&#299;ha was a very great devotee of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and he had three sons, named Pratihart&#257;, Prastot&#257; and Udg&#257;t&#257;. Pratihart&#257; had two sons, Aja and Bh&#363;m&#257;. The son of Bh&#363;m&#257; was Udg&#299;tha, and the son of Udg&#299;tha was Prast&#257;va. The son of Prast&#257;va was Vibhu, and the son of Vibhu was P&#7771;thu&#7779;e&#7751;a, whose son was Nakta. The wife of Nakta, Druti, gave birth to Gaya, who was a very famous and saintly king. Actually King Gaya was a partial incarnation of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and because of his great devotion to Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u he received the title Mah&#257;puru&#7779;a. King Gaya had sons named Citraratha, Sumati and Avarodhana. The son of Citraratha was the emperor Samr&#257;&#7789;, and his son was Mar&#299;ci, whose son was Bindu. Bindu&rsquo;s son was Madhu, and Madhu&rsquo;s son was V&#299;ravrata. V&#299;ravrata&rsquo;s two sons were Manthu and Pramanthu, and the son of Manthu was Bhauvana. The son of Bhauvana was Tva&#7779;&#7789;&#257;, and the son of Tva&#7779;&#7789;&#257; was Viraja, who glorified the whole dynasty. Viraja had one hundred sons and one daughter.

[This is called upal&#257;lana.] He would also give them good instructions on how to become first-class citizens. [This is called anu&#347;&#257;sana.] Such were the characteristics of King Gaya&rsquo;s royal order. Besides all this, King Gaya was a householder who strictly observed the rules and regulations of household life. He performed sacrifices and was an unalloyed pure devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He was called Mah&#257;puru&#7779;a because as a king he gave the citizens all facilities, and as a householder he executed all his duties so that at the end he became a strict devotee of the Supreme Lord. As a devotee, he was always ready to give respect to other devotees and to engage in the devotional service of the Lord. This is the bhakti-yoga process. Due to all these transcendental activities, King Gaya was always free from the bodily conception. He was full in Brahman realization, and consequently he was always jubilant. He did not experience material lamentation. Although he was perfect in all respects, he was not proud, nor was he anxious to rule the kingdom.</div><A NAME="71312"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="71313"></A><div class="First">As Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a states in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> when He descends on earth, He has two types of business&mdash;to give protection to the faithful and annihilate the demons (<span class="Italic">paritr&#257;&#7751;&#257;ya s&#257;dh&#363;n&#257;&#7745; vin&#257;&#347;&#257;ya ca du&#7779;k&#7771;t&#257;m</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="indexb53f.html?g=1496">4.8</a>]). Since the king is the representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is sometimes called <span class="Italic">nara-deva,</span> that is, the Lord as a human being. According to the Vedic injunctions, he is worshiped as God on the material platform. As a representative of the Supreme Lord, the king had the duty to protect the citizens in a perfect way so that they would not be anxious for food and protection and so that they would be jubilant. The king would supply everything for their benefit, and because of this he would levy taxes. If the king or government otherwise levies taxes on the citizens, he becomes responsible for the sinful activities of the citizens. In Kali-yuga, monarchy is abolished because the kings themselves are subjected to the influence of Kali-yuga. It is understood from the <span class="Italic">R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</span> that when Bibh&#299;&#7779;a&#7751;a became friends with Lord R&#257;macandra, he promised that if by chance or will he broke the laws of friendship with Lord R&#257;macandra, he would become a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> or a king in Kali-yuga. In this age, as Bibh&#299;&#7779;a&#7751;a indicated, both <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and kings are in a wretched condition. Actually there are no kings or <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> in this age, and due to their absence the whole world is in a chaotic condition and is always in distress. Compared to present standards, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Gaya was a true representative of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u; therefore he was known as Mah&#257;puru&#7779;a.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Apart from our modern distinguished estimations of where the planetary systems are located, we can understand that the sky and its various planets were studied long, long before <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> was compiled. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; explained the location of the planets, and this indicates that the information was known long, long before &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; related it to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it. The location of the various planetary systems was not unknown to the sages who flourished in the Vedic age.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The denizens of heaven use this gold for various kinds of ornaments. Therefore all the inhabitants of the heavenly planets and their youthful wives are fully decorated with golden helmets, bangles and belts, and thus they enjoy life.</div><A NAME="71625"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="71626"></A><div class="First">By the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the rivers on some planets produce gold on their banks. The poor inhabitants of this earth, because of their incomplete knowledge, are captivated by a so-called <span class="Italic">bhagav&#257;n</span> who can produce a small quantity of gold. However, it is understood that in a higher planetary system in this material world, the mud on the banks of the Jamb&#363;-nad&#299; mixes with <span class="Italic">jamb&#363;</span> juice, reacts with the sunshine in the air, and automatically produces huge quantities of gold. Thus the men and women are decorated there by various golden ornaments, and they look very nice. Unfortunately, on earth there is such a scarcity of gold that the governments of the world try to keep it in reserve and issue paper currency. Because that currency is not backed up by gold, the paper they distribute as money is worthless, but nevertheless the people on earth are very proud of material advancement. In modern times, girls and ladies have ornaments made of plastic instead of gold, and plastic utensils are used instead of golden ones, yet people are very proud of their material wealth. Therefore the people of this age are described as <span class="Italic">mand&#257;&#7717; sumanda-matayo manda-bh&#257;gy&#257; hy upadrut&#257;&#7717;</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="indexba1f.html?g=6203">1.1.10</a>). In other words, they are extremely bad and slow to understand the opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They have been described as <span class="Italic">sumanda-mataya&#7717;</span> because their conceptions are so crippled that they accept a bluffer who produces a little gold to be God. Because they have no gold in their possession, they are actually poverty-stricken, and therefore they are considered unfortunate.</div><A NAME="71627"></A><div class="Purport">Sometimes these unfortunate people want to be promoted to the heavenly planets to achieve fortunate positions, as described in this verse, but pure devotees of the Lord are not at all interested in such opulence. Indeed, devotees sometimes compare the color of gold to that of bright golden stool. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu has instructed devotees not to be allured by golden ornaments and beautifully decorated women. <span class="Italic">Na dhana&#7745; na jana&#7745; na sundar&#299;m:</span> a devotee should not be allured by gold. beautiful women or the prestige of having many followers. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, therefore, confidentially prayed, <span class="Italic">mama janmani janman&#299;&#347;vare bhavat&#257;d bhaktir ahaituk&#299; tvayi:</span> &ldquo;My Lord, please bless Me with Your devotional service.

This is human civilization. Ample food grains can be produced through agricultural enterprises, and profuse supplies of milk, yogurt and ghee can be arranged through cow protection. Abundant honey can be obtained if the forests are protected. Unfortunately, in modern civilization, men are busy killing the cows that are the source of yogurt, milk and ghee, they are cutting down all the trees that supply honey, and they are opening factories to manufacture nuts, bolts, automobiles and wine instead of engaging in agriculture. How can the people be happy? They must suffer from all the misery of materialism. Their bodies become wrinkled and gradually deteriorate until they become almost like dwarves, and a bad odor emanates from their bodies because of unclean perspiration resulting from eating all kinds of nasty things. This is not human civilization. If people actually want happiness in this life and want to prepare for the best in the next life, they must adopt a Vedic civilization.

Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u once approached Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja while the King was performing a sacrifice. The Lord appeared before him as Trivikrama, or V&#257;mana, and begged alms from the King in the form of three steps of land. With two steps, Lord V&#257;mana covered all three planetary systems and pierced the covering of the universe with the toes of His left foot. A few drops of water from the Causal Ocean leaked through this hole and fell on the head of Lord &#346;iva, where they remained for one thousand millenniums. These drops of water are the sacred Ganges River. It first flows onto the heavenly planets, which are located on the soles of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&rsquo;s feet. The Ganges River is known by many names, such as the Bh&#257;g&#299;rath&#299; and the J&#257;hnav&#299;.

Then He extended His left foot to the end of the universe and pierced a hole in its covering with the nail of His big toe. Through the hole, the pure water of the Causal Ocean entered this universe as the Ganges River. Having washed the lotus feet of the Lord, which are covered with reddish powder, the water of the Ganges acquired a very beautiful pink color. Every living being can immediately purify his mind of material contamination by touching the transcendental water of the Ganges, yet its waters remain ever pure. Because the Ganges directly touches the lotus feet of the Lord before descending within this universe, she is known as Vi&#7779;&#7751;upad&#299;. Later she received other names like J&#257;hnav&#299; and Bh&#257;g&#299;rath&#299;. After one thousand millenniums, the water of the Ganges descended on Dhruvaloka, the topmost planet in this universe.

It is a proven fact that a person who regularly bathes in the Ganges is purified both externally and internally. Externally his body becomes immune to all kinds of disease, and internally he gradually develops a devotional attitude toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Throughout India, many thousands of people live on the banks of the Ganges, and by regularly bathing in her waters, they are undoubtedly being purified both spiritually and materially. Many sages, including &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya, have composed prayers in praise of the Ganges, and the land of India itself has become glorious because such rivers as the Ganges, Yamun&#257;, God&#257;var&#299;, K&#257;ver&#299;, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;&#257; and Narmad&#257; flow there.

Prabodh&#257;nanda Sarasvat&#299; confirms his statement as follows:</div><A NAME="71763"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">kaivalya&#7745; narak&#257;yate tri-da&#347;a-p&#363;r &#257;k&#257;&#347;a-pu&#7779;p&#257;yate<br>durd&#257;ntendriya-k&#257;la-sarpa-pa&#7789;al&#299; protkh&#257;ta-da&#7745;&#7779;&#7789;r&#257;yate<br>vi&#347;va&#7745; p&#363;r&#7751;a-sukh&#257;yate vidhi-mahendr&#257;di&#347; ca k&#299;&#7789;&#257;yate<br>yat k&#257;ru&#7751;ya-ka&#7789;&#257;k&#7779;a-vaibhavavat&#257;&#7745; ta&#7745; gauram eva stuma&#7717;</div></div><A NAME="71764"></A><div class="After-Verse">&#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu has perfectly enunciated and broadcast the process of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> Consequently, for one who has taken shelter at the lotus feet of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, the highest perfection of the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s, <span class="Italic">kaivalya,</span> or becoming one with the Supreme, is considered hellish, to say nothing of the <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span>&rsquo; aspiration to be promoted to the heavenly planets.

After the water of the Causal Ocean leaks through the hole created by Lord V&#257;manadeva, it flows down to Dhruvaloka (the polestar) and then to the seven planets beneath Dhruvaloka. Then it is carried to the moon by innumerable celestial airplanes, and then it falls to the top of Mount Meru, which is known as Sumeru-parvata. In this way, the water of the Ganges finally reaches the lower planets and the peaks of the Himalayas, and from there it flows through Hardwar and throughout the plains of India, purifying the entire land. How the Ganges water reaches the various planets from the top of the universe is explained herein. Celestial airplanes carry the water from the planets of the sages to other planets. So-called advanced scientists of the modern age are trying to go to the higher planets, but at the same time they are experiencing a power shortage on earth. If they were actually capable scientists, they could personally go by airplane to other planets, but this they are unable to do. Having now given up their moon excursions, they are attempting to go to other planets, but without success.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Most people in India are still inclined to bathe in the Ganges, and there are many places where they can do so. At Pray&#257;ga (Allahabad), many thousands of people gather during the month of January to bathe in the confluence of the Ganges and Yamun&#257;. Afterward, many of them go to the confluence of the Bay of Bengal and the Ganges to take bath there. Thus it is a special facility for all the people of India that they can bathe in the water of the Ganges at so many places of pilgrimage.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Pregnancy takes place only in lower-grade life. For example, animals like dogs and hogs become pregnant twice a year, and each time they beget at least half a dozen offspring. Even lower species of life such as snakes give birth to hundreds of young at one time. This verse informs us that in grades of life higher than ours, pregnancy occurs once in a lifetime. People still have sex life, but there is no pregnancy. In the spiritual world, people are not very attracted to sex life, due to their exalted devotional attitude. Practically speaking, there is no sex life in the spiritual world, but even if sometimes it does occur, there is no pregnancy at all. On the planet earth, however, human beings do become pregnant, although the tendency is to avoid having children. In this sinful age of Kali, people have even taken to the process of killing the child in the womb.

Aquatic birds such as swans, ducks, water chickens, and cranes become greatly excited by the fragrance of lotus flowers, and the charming sound of bumblebees fills the air. The inhabitants of those lands are important leaders among the demigods. Always attended by their respective servants, they enjoy life in gardens alongside the lakes. In this pleasing situation, the wives of the demigods smile playfully at their husbands and look upon them with lusty desires. All the demigods and their wives are constantly supplied with sandalwood pulp and flower garlands by their servants.

In that atmosphere they enjoy life with their very beautiful wives, who are always sexually stimulated. Nonetheless, they are all devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as will be explained in subsequent verses. The inhabitants of this earth also desire such heavenly enjoyment, but when they somehow or other achieve imitation pleasures like sex and intoxication, they completely forget the service of the Supreme Lord.

But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it.&rdquo; All conditioned souls working within the illusory energy of the Lord consider the body to be the self, and thus they continuously wander throughout the universe, taking birth in different species of life and creating more and more problems. Sometimes they become disgusted with the problems and seek out a process by which they can get out of this entanglement. Unfortunately, such so-called research workers are unaware of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His illusory energy, and thus all of them work only in darkness. never finding a way out. So-called scientists and advanced research scholars are ludicrously trying to find the cause of life. They take no notice of the fact that life is already being produced. What will be their credit if they find out the chemical composition of life? All their chemicals are nothing but different transformations of the five elements&mdash;earth, water, fire, air and ether. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexd7ba.html?g=565">2.20</a>), the living entity is never created (<span class="Italic">na j&#257;yate mriyate v&#257; kad&#257;cin</span>). There are five gross material elements and three minor material elements (mind, intelligence and ego), and there are eternal living entities. The living entity desires a certain type of body, and by the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, that body is created from material nature, which is nothing but a kind of machine handled by the Supreme Lord. The Lord gives the living entity a particular type of mechanical body, and the living entity must work with it according to the law of fruitive activities. Fruitive activities are described in this verse: <span class="Italic">karma-paman&#299;&#7745; m&#257;y&#257;m.</span> The living entity is seated on a machine (the body), and according to the order of the Supreme Lord, he operates the machine. This is the secret of transmigration of the soul from one body to another. The living entity thus becomes entangled in fruitive activities in this material world. As confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index6669.html?g=4886">15.7</a>), <span class="Italic">mana&#7717; &#7779;a&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;n&#299;ndriy&#257;&#7751;i prak&#7771;ti-sth&#257;ni kar&#7779;ati:</span> the living entity is struggling very hard against the six senses, which include the mind.</div><A NAME="72010"></A><div class="Purport">In all the activities of creation and annihilation, the living entity is entangled in fruitive activities, which are executed by the illusory energy, <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> He is exactly like a computer handled by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

The predominating ruler of Bhadr&#257;&#347;va-var&#7779;a is Bhadra&#347;rav&#257;. He and his many servants always worship the incarnation known as Lord Hayagr&#299;va. At the end of each <span class="Italic">kalpa,</span> when the demon Aj&ntilde;&#257;na steals the Vedic knowledge, Lord Hayagr&#299;va appears and preserves it. Then He delivers it to Lord Brahm&#257;. In the land known as Hari-var&#7779;a, the exalted devotee Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja worships Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva. (The appearance of Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva is described in the Seventh Canto of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span>) Following in the footsteps of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, the inhabitants of Hari-var&#7779;a always worship Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva to receive from Him the benediction of being engaged in His loving service. In the tract of land known as Ketum&#257;la-var&#7779;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead (Lord H&#7771;&#7779;&#299;ke&#347;a) appears in the form of Cupid. The goddess of fortune and the demigods living there engage in His service day and night. Manifesting Himself in sixteen parts, Lord H&#7771;&#7779;&#299;ke&#347;a is the source of all encouragement, strength and influence. The conditioned living entity has the defect of being always fearful, but simply by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he can rid himself of this defect of material life. Therefore the Lord alone can be addressed as master. In the tract of land known as Ramyaka-var&#7779;a, Manu and all the inhabitants worship Matsyadeva to this very day. Matsyadeva, whose form is pure goodness, is the ruler and maintainer of the whole universe, and as such He is the director of all the demigods, headed by King Indra. In Hira&#7751;maya-var&#7779;a Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u has assumed the form of a tortoise (K&#363;rma <span class="Italic">m&#363;rti</span>) and is worshiped there by Aryam&#257;, along with all the other residents. Similarly, in the tract of land known as Uttarakuru-var&#7779;a, Lord &#346;r&#299; Hari has assumed the form of a boar, and in that form He accepts service from all the inhabitants living there.</div></div><A NAME="72019"></A><div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">All the information in this chapter can be fully realized by one who associates with devotees of the Lord. Therefore in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> it is recommended that one associate with devotees. This is better than residing on the banks of the Ganges. In the hearts of pure devotees reside all good sentiments as well as all the superior qualities of the demigods. In the hearts of nondevotees, however, there cannot be any good qualities, for such people are simply enchanted by the external, illusory energy of the Lord. Following in the footsteps of devotees, one should know that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the only worshipable Deity. Everyone should accept this proposal and worship the Lord. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a>), <span class="Italic">vedai&#347; ca sarvair aham eva vedya&#7717;:</span> the purpose of studying all Vedic literature is to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. If after studying all the Vedic literature, one does not awaken his dormant love for the Supreme Lord, it is to be understood that he has labored for nothing. He has simply wasted his time. Lacking attachment for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he remains attached to family life in this material world. Thus the lesson of this chapter is that one should get out of family life and completely take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

How wonderful it is that the foolish materialist does not heed the great danger of impending death! He knows that death will surely come, yet he is nevertheless callous and neglectful. If his father dies, he wants to enjoy his father&rsquo;s property, and if his son dies, he wants to enjoy his son&rsquo;s possessions as well. In either case, he heedlessly tries to enjoy material happiness with the acquired money.</div><A NAME="72054"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="72055"></A><div class="First">Material happiness means to have good facilities for eating, sleeping, sexual intercourse and defense. Within this world, the materialistic person lives only for these four principles of sense gratification, not caring for the impending danger of death. After his father&rsquo;s death, a son tries to inherit his money and use it for sense gratification. Similarly, one whose son dies tries to enjoy the possessions of his son. Sometimes the father of a dead son even enjoys his son&rsquo;s widow. Materialistic persons behave in this way. Thus &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; says, &ldquo;How wonderful are these pastimes of material happiness transacted by the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead!&rdquo; In other words, materialistic persons want to commit all kinds of sinful activities, but without the sanction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, no one can do anything. Why does the Supreme Personality of Godhead permit sinful activities? The Supreme Lord does not want any living being to act sinfully, and He begs him through his good conscience to refrain from sin. But when someone insists upon acting sinfully, the Supreme Lord gives him the sanction to act at his own risk (<span class="Italic">matta&#7717; sm&#7771;tir j&ntilde;&#257;nam apohana&#7745; ca</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="index95c7.html?g=4958">15.15</a></I>]</I>). No one can do anything without the sanction of the Lord, but He is so kind that when the conditioned soul persists in doing something, the Lord permits the individual soul to act at his own risk.</div><A NAME="72056"></A><div class="Purport">According to &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura, sons always outlive their fathers in other planetary systems and other lands in this universe, especially on Svargaloka. However, on this planet earth a son often dies before his father, and the materialistic father is pleased to enjoy the possessions of his son. Neither the father nor the son can see the reality&mdash;that both of them are awaiting death. When death comes, however, all their plans for material enjoyment are finished.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

In trance they realize the factual position of this world, and they preach the truth as well. Yet even they are sometimes bewildered by Your illusory energy. This is Your own wonderful pastime. Therefore, I can understand that Your illusory energy is very wonderful, and I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.</div><A NAME="72069"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="72070"></A><div class="First">Not only does the illusory energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead act on the conditioned soul within this material world, but sometimes it also acts on the most advanced learned scholars, who factually know the constitutional position of this material world through realization. As soon as someone thinks, &ldquo;I am this material body (<span class="Italic">aha&#7745; mameti</I> [SB </span></I><a href="index7382.html?g=42801">5.5.8</a>]) and everything in relationship with this material body is mine,&rdquo; he is in illusion (<span class="Italic">moha</span>). This illusion caused by the material energy acts especially on the conditioned souls, but it sometimes also acts on liberated souls as well. A liberated soul is a person who has sufficient knowledge of this material world and is therefore unattached to the bodily conception of life. But because of association with the modes of material nature for a very long time, even liberated souls sometimes become captivated by the illusory energy due to inattentiveness in the transcendental position. Therefore Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexd990.html?g=2586">7.14</a>), <span class="Italic">m&#257;m eva ye prapadyante m&#257;y&#257;m et&#257;&#7745; taranti te:</span> &ldquo;Only those who surrender unto Me can overcome the influence of the material energy.&rdquo; Therefore no one should think of himself as a liberated person immune to the influence of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> Everyone should very cautiously execute devotional service by rigidly following regulative principles. Thus he will remain fixed at the lotus feet of the Lord. Otherwise, a little inattention will create havoc. We have already seen an example of this in the case of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata was undoubtedly a great devotee, but because he turned his attention slightly toward a small deer, he had to suffer two more births, one as a deer and another as the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> Ja&#7693;a Bharata. Afterward he was liberated and went back home, back to Godhead.</div><A NAME="72071"></A><div class="Purport">The Lord is always prepared to excuse His devotee, but if a devotee takes advantage of the Lord&rsquo;s leniency and purposefully commits mistakes again and again, the Lord will certainly punish him by letting him fall down into the clutches of the illusory energy. In other words, theoretical knowledge acquired by studying the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is insufficient to protect one from the clutches of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> One must strongly adhere to the lotus feet of the Lord in devotional service.

Thus Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was the perfect representative of materialistic life. He was therefore the cause of great disturbance to the topmost devotee, Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, until Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva killed him.

Therefore we should pray to Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva to sit in our hearts.

Whenever one offers a prayer to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one always requests some benediction from Him. Even pure (<span class="Italic">ni&#7779;k&#257;ma</span>) devotees pray for some benediction, as instructed by Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu in His <span class="Italic">&#346;ik&#7779;&#257;&#7779;&#7789;aka:</span></div><A NAME="72146"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">ayi nanda-tanuja ki&#7749;kara&#7745;<br>patita&#7745; m&#257;&#7745; vi&#7779;ame bhav&#257;mbudhau<br>k&#7771;pay&#257; tava p&#257;da-pa&#7749;kaja-<br>sthita-dh&#363;l&#299;-sad&#7771;&#347;a&#7745; vicintaya</div></div><A NAME="72147"></A><div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;O son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Nanda [K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a], I am Your eternal servitor, yet somehow or other I have fallen into the ocean of birth and death.

The first desire expressed in his prayer is <span class="Italic">svasty astu vi&#347;vasya:</span> &ldquo;Let there be good fortune throughout the entire universe.&rdquo; Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja thus requested the Lord to be merciful to everyone, including his father, a most envious person. According to C&#257;&#7751;akya Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita, there are two kinds of envious living entities: one is a snake, and the other is the man like Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, who is by nature envious of everyone, even of his father or son. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was envious of his little son Prahl&#257;da, but Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja asked a benediction for the benefit of his father. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was very envious of devotees, but Prahl&#257;da wished that his father and other demons like him would give up their envious nature by the grace of the Lord and stop harassing the devotees (<span class="Italic">khala&#7717; pras&#299;dat&#257;m</span>). The difficulty is that the <span class="Italic">khala</span> (envious living entity) is rarely pacified. One kind of <span class="Italic">khala,</span> the snake, can be pacified simply by <span class="Italic">mantras</span> or by the action of a particular herb (<span class="Italic">mantrau&#7779;adhi-va&#347;a&#7717; sarpa&#7717; khalakena niv&#257;ryate</span>). An envious person, however, cannot be pacified by any means. Therefore Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja prays that all envious persons may undergo a change of heart and think of the welfare of others.</div><A NAME="72148"></A><div class="Purport">If the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement spreads all over the world, and if by the grace of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a everyone accepts it, the thinking of envious people will change. Everyone will think of the welfare of others. Therefore Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja prays, <span class="Italic">&#347;iva&#7745; mitho dhiy&#257;.</span> In material activities, everyone is envious of others, but in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, no one is envious of anyone else; everyone thinks of the welfare of others. Therefore Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja prays that everyone&rsquo;s mind may become gentle by being fixed at the lotus feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (<span class="Italic">bhajat&#257;d adhok&#7779;aje</span>). As indicated elsewhere in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<span class="Italic">sa vai mana&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-pad&#257;ravindayo&#7717;</span>) and as advised by Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index673b.html?g=5988">18.65</a>), <span class="Italic">man-man&#257; bhava mad-bhakta&#7717;,</span> one should constantly think of the lotus feet of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Then one&rsquo;s mind will certainly be cleansed (<span class="Italic">ceto-darpa&#7751;a-m&#257;rjanam</I> [Cc. Antya </I><a href="index0860.html?g=154712">20.12</a></I>]</span></I>). Materialists always think of sense gratification, but Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja prays that the Lord&rsquo;s mercy will change their minds and they will stop thinking of sense gratification. If they think of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a always, everything will be all right. Some people argue that if everyone thought of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in that way, the whole universe would be vacated because everyone would go back home, back to Godhead.

When the living entity remains in contact with the all-pervading V&#257;sudeva, the Personality of Godhead, he manifests his spiritual power, exactly as the crocodile exhibits its strength in the water. In other words, the greatness of the living entity can be perceived when he is in the spiritual world, engaged in spiritual activities. Many householders, although well-educated in the knowledge of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> become attached to family life.

In the material world, a so-called husband is dependent on the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There are many examples of a woman whose husband, being dependent on the result of his own fruitive actions, cannot maintain his wife, her children, her wealth or her duration of life. Therefore, factually the only real husband of all women is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the supreme husband.

Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu discusses this point with Vye&#7749;ka&#7789;a Bha&#7789;&#7789;a in <span class="Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Madhya</span> <a href="index79fa.html?g=107744">9.111</a>&ndash;131): &ldquo;The Lord inquired from Vye&#7749;ka&#7789;a Bha&#7789;&#7789;a, &lsquo;Your worshipable goddess of fortune, Lak&#7779;m&#299;, always remains on the chest of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, and she is certainly the most chaste woman in the creation. However, My Lord is Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, a cowherd boy engaged in tending cows. Why is it that Lak&#7779;m&#299;, being such a chaste wife, wants to associate with My Lord? Just to associate with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Lak&#7779;m&#299; abandoned all transcendental happiness in Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha and for a long time accepted vows and regulative principles and performed unlimited austerities.&rsquo;</div><A NAME="72371"></A><div class="Purport">&ldquo;Vye&#7749;ka&#7789;a Bha&#7789;&#7789;a replied, &lsquo;Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and Lord N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a are one and the same, but the pastimes of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a are more relishable due to their sportive nature. They are very pleasing for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s <span class="Italic">&#347;aktis.</span> Since K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a are both the same personality, Lak&#7779;m&#299;&rsquo;s association with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a did not break her vow of chastity. Rather, it was in great fun that the goddess of fortune wanted to associate with Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The goddess of fortune considered that her vow of chastity would not be damaged by her relationship with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Rather, by associating with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a she could enjoy the benefit of the <span class="Italic">r&#257;sa</span> dance.

Why are you joking so about this?&rsquo;</div><A NAME="72372"></A><div class="Purport">&ldquo;Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu replied, &lsquo;I know that there is no fault in the goddess of fortune, but still she could not enter into the <span class="Italic">r&#257;sa</span> dance. We hear this from revealed scriptures. The authorities of Vedic knowledge met Lord R&#257;macandra in Da&#7751;&#7693;ak&#257;ra&#7751;ya, and by their penances and austerities, they were allowed to enter into the <span class="Italic">r&#257;sa</span> dance. But can you tell me why the goddess of fortune, Lak&#7779;m&#299;, could not get that opportunity? &rsquo;</div><A NAME="72373"></A><div class="Purport">&ldquo;To this Vye&#7749;ka&#7789;a Bha&#7789;&#7789;a replied, &lsquo;I cannot enter into the mystery of this incident. I am an ordinary living being. My intelligence is limited, and I am always disturbed. How can I understand the pastimes of the Supreme Lord? They are deeper than millions of oceans.&rsquo;</div><A NAME="72374"></A><div class="Purport">&ldquo;Lord Caitanya replied, &lsquo;Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a has a specific characteristic. He attracts everyone&rsquo;s heart by the mellow of His personal conjugal love. By following in the footsteps of the inhabitants of the planet known as Vrajaloka or Goloka V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, one can attain the shelter of the lotus feet of &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. However, the inhabitants of that planet do not know that Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Unaware that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the Supreme Lord, the residents of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana like Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, Ya&#347;od&#257;dev&#299; and the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> treat K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as their beloved son or lover. Mother Ya&#347;od&#257; accepts Him as her son and sometimes binds Him to a grinding mortar. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s cowherd boy friends think He is an ordinary boy and get up on His shoulders. In Goloka V&#7771;nd&#257;vana no one has any desire other than to love K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.&rsquo; &rdquo;</div><A NAME="72375"></A><div class="Purport">The conclusion is that one cannot associate with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a unless he has fully received the favor of the inhabitants of Vrajabh&#363;mi. Therefore if one wants to be delivered by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a directly, he must take to the service of the residents of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, who are unalloyed devotees of the Lord.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

When so-called philanthropists, who supposedly want to help the poor, are approached by members of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, they say, &ldquo;You are simply wasting your time, while I am feeding vast masses of starving people.&rdquo; Unfortunately, their meager efforts, either singly or together, do not solve anyone&rsquo;s problems.</div><A NAME="72428"></A><div class="Purport">Sometimes so-called <span class="Italic">sv&#257;m&#299;s</span> are very eager to feed poor people, thinking them to be <span class="Italic">daridra-n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a,</span> the Lord&rsquo;s incarnations as beggars.

Heat and light are the formless energies of fire, and in that sense they are unreal. Only the fire has form, and therefore it is the real form of the heat and light.

For example, if someone becomes angry for a certain period, no one can say that his anger is false. It is simply temporary. Everything we experience in our daily lives is of this same character; it is temporary but real.</div><A NAME="72495"></A><div class="Purport">The different kinds of living entities coming from various sources are very clearly described in this verse. Some are born from a womb and some (like certain insects) from human perspiration. Others hatch from eggs, and still others sprout from the earth. A living entity takes birth under different circumstances according to his past activities (<span class="Italic">karma</span>). Although the body of the living entity is material, it is never false. No one will accept the argument that since a person&rsquo;s material body is false, murder has no repercussions. Our temporary bodies are given to us according to our <span class="Italic">karma,</span> and we must remain in our given bodies to enjoy the pains and pleasures of life. Our bodies cannot be called false; they are only temporary. In other words, the energy of the Supreme Lord is as permanent as the Lord Himself, although His energy is sometimes manifest and sometimes not.

The inhabitants of Kimpuru&#7779;a-var&#7779;a are fortunate because they worship Lord R&#257;macandra with His faithful servant Hanum&#257;n.

The Lord is pleased only by the process of surrender unto Him.</div></div><A NAME="72608"></A><div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">When Devar&#7779;i N&#257;rada descended to instruct S&#257;rva&#7751;i Manu, he described the opulence of Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a, India. S&#257;rva&#7751;i Manu and the inhabitants of Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a engage in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the origin of creation, maintenance and annihilation and who is always worshiped by self-realized souls. In the planet known as Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a there are many rivers and mountains, as there are in other tracts of land, yet Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a has special significance because in this tract of land there exists the Vedic principle of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma,</span> which divides society into four <span class="Italic">var&#7751;as</span> and four <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;ramas.</span> Furthermore, N&#257;rada Muni&rsquo;s opinion is that even if there is some temporary disturbance in the execution of the <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> principles, they can be revived at any moment. The effect of adhering to the institution of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</span> is gradual elevation to the spiritual platform and liberation from material bondage. By following the principles of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma,</span> one gets the opportunity to associate with devotees. Such association gradually awakens one&rsquo;s dormant propensity to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead and frees one from all the basic principles of sinful life. One then gets the opportunity to offer unalloyed devotional service to the Supreme Lord, V&#257;sudeva. Because of this opportunity, the inhabitants of Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a are praised even in the heavenly planets. Even in the topmost planet of this universe, Brahmaloka, the position of Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a is discussed with great relish.</div></div><A NAME="72609"></A><div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">All the conditioned living entities are evolving within the universe in different planets and different species of life.

Any place where one cannot hear about the Supreme Personality of Godhead from realized souls, even if it be Brahmaloka, is not very congenial to the living entity. If one who has taken birth in the land of Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a as a human being does not take advantage of the opportunity for spiritual elevation, his position is certainly the most miserable.

We know that the <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-tattva</span> is carried by the transcendental bird Garu&#7693;a and is equipped with different types of weapons in four hands. Therefore we may doubt whether Lord R&#257;macandra could be in the same category, since He was carried by Hanum&#257;n, not by Garu&#7693;a, and had neither four hands nor the <span class="Italic">&#347;a&#7749;kha, cakra, gad&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">padma.</span> Consequently this verse clarifies that R&#257;macandra is as good as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (<span class="Italic">r&#257;m&#257;di-m&#363;rti&#7779;u kal&#257;</span>).

The <span class="Italic">j&#299;v&#257;tm&#257;</span> may introduce himself as an Indian, American, German and so on, but the Param&#257;tm&#257; has no such material designations, and therefore He has no material name. The <span class="Italic">j&#299;v&#257;tm&#257;</span> is different from his name, but the Param&#257;tm&#257; is not; His name and He Himself are one and the same. This is the meaning of <span class="Italic">niraham,</span> which means &ldquo;without material designations.&rdquo; This word cannot possibly be twisted to mean that the Param&#257;tm&#257; has no <span class="Italic">aha&#7749;k&#257;ra,</span> no &ldquo;I-ness&rdquo; or identity. He has His transcendental identity as the Supreme. This is the explanation given by &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;. According to another interpretation, given by Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura, <span class="Italic">niraham</span> means <span class="Italic">nirni&#347;cayena aham.</span> <span class="Italic">Niraham</span> does not mean that the Supreme Lord has no identity. Rather, the stress given by the word <span class="Italic">aham</span> proves strongly that He does have His personal identity because <span class="Italic">nir</span> not only means &ldquo;negative&rdquo; but also means &ldquo;strong ascertainment.&rdquo;</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Lord R&#257;macandra&rsquo;s mission, however, was not only to kill R&#257;va&#7751;a but also to teach mortal beings that material happiness centered around sex life or centered around one&rsquo;s wife is the cause of many miseries. He is the self-sufficient Supreme Personality of Godhead, and nothing is lamentable for Him.

To protect the devotees, the Lord not only satisfies them by His personal presence but also teaches them so that they will not fall down from devotional service. By His personal example, Lord R&#257;macandra taught the devotees that it is better not to enter married life, which is certainly followed by many tribulations. As confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="indexaa4a.html?g=57238">7.9.45</a>):</div><A NAME="72679"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">yan maithun&#257;di-g&#7771;hamedhi-sukha&#7745; hi tuccha&#7745;<br>ka&#7751;&#7693;&#363;yanena karayor iva du&#7717;kha-du&#7717;kham<br>t&#7771;pyanti neha k&#7771;pa&#7751;&#257; bahu-du&#7717;kha-bh&#257;ja&#7717;<br>ka&#7751;&#7693;&#363;tivan manasija&#7745; vi&#7779;aheta-dh&#299;ra&#7717;</div></div><A NAME="72680"></A><div class="After-Verse"><span class="Italic">K&#7771;pa&#7751;as,</span> those who are not advanced in spiritual knowledge and who are therefore just the opposite of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> generally take to family life, which is a concession for sex. Thus they enjoy sex again and again, although that sex is followed by many tribulations. This is a warning to devotees. To teach this lesson to devotees and to human society in general, Lord &#346;r&#299; R&#257;macandra, although the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, underwent a series of tribulations because He accepted a wife, mother S&#299;t&#257;. Lord R&#257;macandra underwent these austerities, of course, only to instruct us; actually He never has any reason to lament for anything.</div><A NAME="72681"></A><div class="Purport">Another aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s instructions is that one who accepts a wife must be a faithful husband and give her full protection. Human society is divided into two classes of men&mdash;those who strictly follow the religious principles and those who are devotees. By His personal example, Lord R&#257;macandra wanted to instruct both of them how to fully adopt the discipline of the religious system and how to be a beloved and dutiful husband. Otherwise He had no reason to undergo apparent tribulations. One who strictly follows religious principles must not neglect to provide all facilities for the complete protection of his wife. There may be some suffering because of this, but one must nevertheless endure it. That is the duty of a faithful husband. By His personal example, Lord R&#257;macandra demonstrated this duty. Lord R&#257;macandra could have produced hundreds and thousands of S&#299;t&#257;s from His pleasure energy, but just to show the duty of a faithful husband, He not only rescued S&#299;t&#257; from the hands of R&#257;va&#7751;a but also killed R&#257;va&#7751;a and all the members of his family.</div><A NAME="72682"></A><div class="Purport">Another aspect of the teachings of Lord R&#257;macandra is that although Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and His devotees may apparently suffer from material tribulations, they have nothing to do with such tribulations. They are <span class="Italic">mukta-puru&#7779;as,</span> liberated persons, under all circumstances.

Therefore the separation of Lord R&#257;macandra from S&#299;t&#257;dev&#299;, as well as the consequent tribulation they suffered, is but another display of transcendental bliss.

He is called renounced because He is not attached to anything in this material world; He is specifically attached to the spiritual world and the living entities there. The affairs of the material world take place under the superintendence of Durg&#257;dev&#299; (<span class="Italic">s&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;i-sthiti-pralaya-s&#257;dhana-&#347;aktir ek&#257;/ ch&#257;yeva yasya bhuvan&#257;ni bibharti durg&#257;</I> [Bs. </span></I>5.44]). Everything is going on under the strict rules and regulations of the material energy, represented by Durg&#257;. Therefore the Lord is completely detached and need not give attention to the material world. S&#299;t&#257;dev&#299; belongs to the spiritual world. Similarly, Lord Lak&#7779;ma&#7751;a, R&#257;macandra&rsquo;s younger brother, is a manifestation of Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a, and Lord R&#257;macandra Himself is V&#257;sudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div><A NAME="72699"></A><div class="Purport">Since the Lord is always spiritually qualified, He is attached to servants who always render transcendental loving service unto Him. He is attached to the truth in life, not to brahminical qualities. Indeed, He is never attached to any material qualities. Although He is the Supersoul of all living entities, He is specifically manifest to those who are self-realized, and He is especially dear to the hearts of His transcendental devotees. Because Lord R&#257;macandra descended to teach human society how dutiful a king should be, He apparently gave up the company of mother S&#299;t&#257; and Lak&#7779;ma&#7751;a. Factually, however, He could not have given them up. One should therefore learn about the activities of Lord R&#257;macandra from a self-realized soul.

Although to the foolish He appears to have accepted a material body like us, He is unaffected by bodily tribulations like hunger, thirst and fatigue. Although He is the witness who sees everything, His senses are unpolluted by the objects He sees. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto that unattached, pure witness of the world, the Supreme Soul, the Personality of Godhead.</div><A NAME="72779"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="72780"></A><div class="First">The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, is described as <span class="Italic">sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha</span><I> <span class="Italic"></I>[</I>Bs. </span>5.1</I>]<span class="Italic"></I>,</span> the body of eternity, transcendental bliss and full knowledge. Now in this verse He is more fully described. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the creator of the entire cosmic manifestation, yet He is unattached to it. If we were to construct a very tall skyscraper, we would be very attached to it, but K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is so renounced that although He has created everything, He is not attached to anything (<span class="Italic">na badhyate</span>). Furthermore, although K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a has His transcendental form, <span class="Italic">sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha</span><I> <span class="Italic"></I>[</I>Bs. </span>5.1</I>]<span class="Italic"></I>,</span> He is not disturbed by the bodily necessities of life, which are called <span class="Italic">daihika;</span> for example, He is never hungry, thirsty or fatigued (<span class="Italic">na hanyate deha-gato &rsquo;pi daihikai&#7717;</span>). Then again, since everything is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s property, He sees everything and is present everywhere, but because His body is transcendental, He is above vision, the objects of vision and the process of vision. When we see someone beautiful, we are attracted. The sight of a beautiful woman immediately attracts a man, and the sight of a man naturally attracts a woman. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, however, is transcendental to all these faults. Although He is the seer of everything, He is not afflicted with faulty vision (<span class="Italic">na d&#7771;g yasya gu&#7751;air vid&#363;&#7779;yate</span>). Therefore, although He is the witness and seer, He is aloof from all affection for the activities He sees. He is always unattached and separate; He is only a witness.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

They are always engaged in chanting the name of the Lord and are always describing Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Therefore this is the best among all the places in the universe. The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement has established its center in M&#257;y&#257;pur, the birthsite of Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, to give men the great opportunity to go there and perform a constant festival of <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana-yaj&ntilde;a,</span> as recommended herein (<span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;e&#347;a-makh&#257; mahotsav&#257;&#7717;</span>) and to distribute <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da</span> to millions of hungry people hankering for spiritual emancipation.

It would be better to live perpetually cramped within the airtight bag of a mother&rsquo;s womb, where one can at least remember the lotus feet of the Lord, than to live in a place where there is no opportunity to remember His lotus feet.

Such a person has perfect intelligence, whereas others are in the ignorance of material existence. Of all the sacrifices mentioned in the Vedic literatures, the performance of <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana-yaj&ntilde;a</span> is the best. Even the performance of one hundred <span class="Italic">a&#347;vamedha</span> sacrifices cannot compare to the sacrifice of <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana.</span> According to the author of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299; Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta,</span> if one compares <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana-yaj&ntilde;a</span> to other <span class="Italic">yaj&ntilde;as,</span> he is a <span class="Italic">p&#257;&#7779;a&#7751;&#7693;&#299;,</span> an infidel, and is liable to be punished by Yamar&#257;ja.

Other paths, such as the path of <span class="Italic">j&ntilde;&#257;na</span> and the path of <span class="Italic">karma,</span> are not very profitable. Pious activities can elevate one to the higher planetary systems, and by speculative knowledge one can merge into the Brahman existence, but that is not real profit, for one has to come down again even from the liberated condition of being merged in Brahman, and certainly one must come down from the heavenly kingdom. One should endeavor to go back home, back to Godhead (<span class="Italic">y&#257;nti mad-y&#257;jino &rsquo;pi m&#257;m</span>). Otherwise there is no difference between human life and the lives of jungle animals and birds. Animals and birds also have freedom, but because of their lower birth, they cannot use it. Taking advantage of all the facilities offered him, a human being who has taken birth in the land of Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a should become a fully enlightened devotee and go back home, back to Godhead. This is the subject matter of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement. The inhabitants of places other than Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a have facilities for material enjoyment, but they do not have the same facility to take to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. Therefore &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu has advised that one who has taken birth as a human being in Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a must first realize himself as a part and parcel of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and after taking to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, he must distribute this knowledge all over the world.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Even the demigods must return to earth to work like ordinary men when the results of their pious activities expire. Nevertheless, the demigods desire to come to the land of Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a if even a small portion of the merits of their pious activities remains. In other words, to take birth in Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a, one must perform more pious activities than the demigods. In Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a one is naturally K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious, and if one further cultivates his K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, by the grace of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a he certainly expands his good fortune by becoming perfect in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness and very easily going back home, back to Godhead. In many other places in the Vedic literature it is found that even the demigods want to come to this land of Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a. A foolish person may desire to be promoted to the heavenly planets as a result of his pious activities, but even the demigods from the heavenly planets want to come to Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a and achieve bodies that may be very easily used to cultivate K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness.

Beyond Pu&#7779;karadv&#299;pa there are two islands, one always lit by the sunshine and the other always dark.

The breadth of Plak&#7779;adv&#299;pa is twice that of the saltwater ocean&mdash;in other words 260,000 yojanas [1,600,000 miles].

The sun is not stationary; it is also moving like the other planets. The sun&rsquo;s movements determine the duration of night and day. When the sun travels north of the equator, it moves slowly during the day and very quickly at night, thus increasing the duration of the daytime and decreasing the duration of night. Similarly, when the sun travels south of the equator, the exact opposite is true&mdash;the duration of the day decreases, and the duration of night increases. When the sun enters Karka&#7789;a-r&#257;&#347;i (Cancer) and then travels to Si&#7745;ha-r&#257;&#347;i (Leo) and so on through Dhanu&#7717;-r&#257;&#347;i (Sagittarius), its course is called Dak&#7779;i&#7751;&#257;yana, the southern way, and when the sun enters Makara-r&#257;&#347;i (Capricorn) and thereafter travels through Kumbhar&#257;&#347;i (Aquarius) and so on through Mithuna-r&#257;&#347;i (Gemini), its course is called Uttar&#257;ya&#7751;a, the northern way. When the sun is in Me&#7779;a-r&#257;&#347;i (Aries) and Tul&#257;-r&#257;&#347;i (Libra), the duration of day and night are equal.</div></div><A NAME="73536"></A><div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level"><TB>On M&#257;nasottara Mountain are the abodes of four demigods. East of Sumeru Mountain is Devadh&#257;n&#299;, where King Indra lives, and south of Sumeru is Sa&#7745;yaman&#299;, the abode of Yamar&#257;ja, the superintendent of death. Similarly, west of Sumeru is Nimlocan&#299;, the abode of Varu&#7751;a, the demigod who controls the water, and north of Sumeru is Vibh&#257;var&#299;, where the demigod of the moon lives. Sunrise, noon, sunset and midnight occur in all these places because of the movements of the sun. Diametrically opposite the place where the sunrise takes places and the sun is seen by human eyes, the sun will be setting and passing away from human vision. Similarly, the people residing diametrically opposite the point where it is midday will be experiencing midnight.

Always staying in front of the sun-god and offering their prayers are sixty thousand sages known as V&#257;likhilyas. There are fourteen Gandharvas, Apsar&#257;s and other demigods, who are divided into seven parties and who perform ritualistic activities every month to worship the Supersoul through the sun-god according to different names.

The Vedic literature informs us that within this universe there is one sun, which is moving. The Western theory that all the luminaries in the sky are different suns is not confirmed in the Vedic literature. Nor can we assume that these luminaries are the suns of other universes, for each universe is covered by various layers of material elements, and therefore although the universes are clustered together, we cannot see from one universe to another. In other words, whatever we see is within this one universe. In each universe there is one Lord Brahm&#257;, and there are other demigods on other planets, but there is only one sun.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

He represents the three <span class="Italic">Vedas&mdash;&#7770;g, Yajur</span> and <span class="Italic">S&#257;ma</span>&mdash;and therefore he is known as Tray&#299;maya, the form of Lord N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. Sometimes the sun-god is also called S&#363;rya N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. The sun-god has expanded himself in twelve divisions, and thus he controls the six seasonal changes and causes winter, summer, rain and so on. <span class="Italic">Yog&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> following the <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</span> institution, who practice <span class="Italic">ha&#7789;ha</span> or <span class="Italic">a&#7779;&#7789;&#257;&#7749;ga-yoga</span> or who perform <span class="Italic">agnihotra</span> sacrifices, worship S&#363;rya N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a for their own benefit. The demigod S&#363;rya is always in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. Residing in outer space, which is in the middle of the universe, between Bh&#363;loka and Bhuvarloka, the sun rotates through the time circle of the zodiac, represented by twelve <span class="Italic">r&#257;&#347;is,</span> or signs, and assumes different names according to the sign he is in. For the moon, every month is divided into two fortnights. Similarly, according to solar calculations, a month is equal to the time the sun spends in one constellation; two months constitute one season, and there are twelve months in a year. The entire area of the sky is divided into two halves, each representing an <span class="Italic">ayana,</span> the course traversed by the sun within a period of six months. The sun travels sometimes slowly, sometimes swiftly and sometimes at a moderate speed. In this way it travels within the three worlds, consisting of the heavenly planets, the earthly planets and outer space. These orbits are referred to by great learned scholars by the names Sa&#7745;vatsara, Parivatsara, I&#7693;&#257;vatsara, Anuvatsara and Vatsara.</div></div><A NAME="73730"></A><div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The moon is situated 100,000 <span class="Italic">yojanas</span> above the rays of the sunshine.

Dhruvaloka, the abode of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u within this universe, is situated 1,300,000 <span class="Italic">yojanas</span> from the seven stars. In the planetary system of Dhruvaloka are the planets of the fire-god, Indra, Praj&#257;pati, Ka&#347;yapa and Dharma, all of whom are very respectful to the great devotee Dhruva, who lives on the polestar.

The Supreme Personality orders the subordinate persons, the demigods of various names, to carry out His supreme will. This fact is also confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="index652d.html?g=3075">9.10</a>), wherein K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says:</div><A NAME="73937"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">may&#257;dhyak&#7779;e&#7751;a prak&#7771;ti&#7717;<br>s&#363;yate sa-car&#257;caram<br>hetun&#257;nena kaunteya<br>jagad viparivartate</div></div><A NAME="73938"></A><div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kunt&#299;, and it is producing all moving and unmoving beings.

It is not because of the laws of gravity. Rather, the planets and stars are enabled to float by manipulations of the air. It is due to such manipulations that big, heavy clouds float and big eagles fly in the sky. Modern airplanes like the 747 jet aircraft work in a similar way: by controlling the air, they float high in the sky, resisting the tendency to fall to earth. Such adjustments of the air are all made possible by the cooperation of the principles of <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a</span> (male) and <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti</span> (female). By the cooperation of material nature, which is considered to be <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti,</span> and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is considered the <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a,</span> all the affairs of the universe are going on nicely in their proper order. <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti,</span> material nature, is also described in the <span class="Ref_Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> (5.44) as follows:</div><A NAME="73943"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">s&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;i-sthiti-pralaya-s&#257;dhana-&#347;aktir ek&#257;<br>ch&#257;yeva yasya bhuvan&#257;ni bibharti durg&#257;<br>icch&#257;nur&#363;pam api yasya ca ce&#7779;&#7789;ate s&#257;<br>govindam &#257;di-puru&#7779;a&#7745; tam aha&#7745; bhaj&#257;mi</div></div><A NAME="73944"></A><div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;The external potency, <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> who is of the nature of the shadow of the <span class="Italic">cit</span> [spiritual] potency, is worshiped by all people as Durg&#257;, the creating, preserving and destroying agency of this mundane world. I adore the primeval Lord Govinda, in accordance with whose will Durg&#257; conducts herself.&rdquo; Material nature, the external energy of the Supreme Lord, is also known as Durg&#257;, or the female energy that protects the great fort of this universe. The word Durg&#257; also means fort. This universe is just like a great fort in which all the conditioned souls are kept, and they cannot leave it unless they are liberated by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord Himself declares in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="indexe89d.html?g=1505">4.9</a>):</div><A NAME="73945"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">janma karma ca me divyam<br>eva&#7745; yo vetti tattvata&#7717;<br>tyaktv&#257; deha&#7745; punar janma<br>naiti m&#257;m eti so &rsquo;rjuna</div></div><A NAME="73946"></A><div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.&rdquo; Thus simply by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can be liberated, or, in other words, one can be released from the great fort of this universe and go outside it to the spiritual world.</div><A NAME="73947"></A><div class="Purport">It is also significant that the predominating deities of even the greatest planets have been offered their exalted posts because of the very valuable pious activities they performed in previous births. This is indicated herein by the words <span class="Italic">karma-nirmita-gataya&#7717;.</span> For example, as we have previously discussed, the moon is called <span class="Italic">j&#299;va,</span> which means that he is a living entity like us, but because of his pious activities he has been appointed to his post as the moon-god. Similarly, all the demigods are living entities who have been appointed to their various posts as the masters of the moon, the earth, Venus and so on because of their great service and pious acts. Only the predominating deity of the sun, S&#363;rya N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, is an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Dhruva, the predominating deity of Dhruvaloka, is also a living entity. Thus there are two kinds of entities&mdash;the supreme entity, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the ordinary living entity, the <span class="Italic">j&#299;va</span> (<span class="Italic">nityo nity&#257;n&#257;&#7745; cetana&#347; cetan&#257;n&#257;m</span>). All the demigods are engaged in the service of the Lord, and only by such an arrangement are the affairs of the universe going on.</div><A NAME="73948"></A><div class="Purport">Regarding the great eagles mentioned in this verse, it is understood that there are eagles so big that they can prey on big elephants. They fly so high that they can travel from one planet to another. They start flying in one planet and land in another, and while in flight they lay eggs that hatch into other birds while falling through the air. In Sanskrit such eagles are called <span class="Italic">&#347;yena.</span> Under the present circumstances, of course, we cannot see such huge birds, but at least we know of eagles that can capture monkeys and then throw them down to kill and eat them. Similarly, it is understood that there are gigantic birds that can carry off elephants, kill them and eat them.</div><A NAME="73949"></A><div class="Purport">The two examples of the eagle and the cloud are sufficient to prove that flying and floating can be made possible through adjustments of the air. The planets, in a similar way, are floating because material nature adjusts the air according to the orders of the Supreme Lord. It could be said that these adjustments constitute the law of gravity, but in any case, one must accept that these laws are made by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The so-called scientists have no control over them. The scientists can falsely, improperly declare that there is no God, but this is not a fact.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The distance from the sun to the earth is lower planetary systems called Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Tal&#257;tala, Mah&#257;tala, Ras&#257;tala and P&#257;t&#257;la.

In Atala there is a demon, the son of Maya D&#257;nava named Bala, who created ninety-six kinds of mystic power. Some so-called yog&#299;s and sv&#257;m&#299;s take advantage of this mystic power to cheat people even today. Simply by yawning, the demon Bala created three kinds of women, known as svairi&#7751;&#299;, k&#257;mi&#7751;&#299; and pu&#7745;&#347;cal&#299;. The svairi&#7751;&#299;s like to marry men from their own group, the k&#257;mi&#7751;&#299;s marry men from any group, and the pu&#7745;&#347;cal&#299;s change husbands one after another. If a man enters the planet of Atala, these women immediately capture him and induce him to drink an intoxicating beverage made with a drug known as h&#257;&#7789;aka [cannabis indica]. This intoxicant endows the man with great sexual prowess, of which the women take advantage for enjoyment. A woman will enchant him with attractive glances, intimate words, smiles of love and then embraces. In this way she induces him to enjoy sex with her to her full satisfaction.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the source of life for all living entities, lives within everyone as the friendly Supersoul, and under His direction a living entity enjoys or suffers in the material world. Greatly appreciating the transcendental qualities of the Lord, Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja offered everything at His lotus feet.

When one becomes a pure devotee in love, he may also be blessed with a good material position by the will of the Supreme Lord.

The demigods possess their material opulence only until the end of the life of Manu. Time is insurmountable. The time one is allotted, even if it be millions of years, is quickly gone. The demigods own their material possessions only within the limits of time. Therefore Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja lamented that although Indra was very learned, he did not know how to use his intelligence properly, for instead of asking V&#257;manadeva to allow him to engage in His service, Indra used Him to beg Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja for material wealth. Although Indra was learned and his prime minister, B&#7771;haspati, was also learned, neither of them begged to be able to render loving service to Lord V&#257;manadeva. Therefore Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja lamented for Indra.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Lord Ananta, whose body is completely spiritual, resides at the root of the planet P&#257;t&#257;la. He always lives in the core of Lord &#346;iva&rsquo;s heart, and He helps him destroy the universe. Ananta instructs Lord &#346;iva how to destroy the cosmos, and thus He is sometimes called <span class="Italic">t&#257;mas&#299;,</span> or &ldquo;one who is in the mode of darkness.&rdquo; He is the original Deity of material consciousness, and because He attracts all living entities, He is sometimes known as Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a. The entire material world is situated on the hoods of Lord Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a. From His forehead He transmits to Lord &#346;iva the power to destroy this material world. Because Lord Sa&#7749;kar&#7779;a&#7751;a is an expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, many devotees offer Him prayers, and in the planetary system of P&#257;t&#257;la, all the <span class="Italic">suras, asuras,</span> Gandharvas, Vidy&#257;dharas and learned sages offer Him their respectful obeisances. The Lord talks with them in a sweet voice. His bodily construction is completely spiritual and very, very beautiful. Anyone who hears about Him from a proper spiritual master becomes free from all material conceptions of life. The entire material energy is working according to the plans of Anantadeva. Therefore we should regard Him as the root cause of the material creation. There is no end to His strength, and no one can fully describe Him, even with countless mouths. Therefore He is called Ananta (unlimited). Being very merciful toward all living entities, He has exhibited His spiritual body. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; describes the glories of Anantadeva to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it in this way.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Because He is intoxicated, the Lord looks bewildered, and His eyes, appearing like flowers in full bloom, move to and fro. He pleases His personal associates, the heads of the demigods, by the sweet vibrations emanating from His mouth. Dressed in bluish garments and wearing a single earring, He holds a plow on His back with His two beautiful and well-constructed hands. Appearing as white as the heavenly King Indra, He wears a golden belt around His waist and a vaijayant&#299; garland of ever-fresh tulas&#299; blossoms around His neck. Bees intoxicated by the honeylike fragrance of the tulas&#299; flowers hum very sweetly around the garland, which thus becomes more and more beautiful.

N&#257;rada Muni, the son of Lord Brahm&#257;, always glorifies Anantadeva in his father&rsquo;s assembly. There he sings blissful verses of his own composition, accompanied by his stringed instrument [or a celestial singer] known as Tumburu.</div><A NAME="74441"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="74442"></A><div class="First">None of these descriptions of Lord Anantadeva are imaginary. They are all transcendentally blissful and full of actual knowledge. However, unless one hears them directly from a bona fide spiritual master in the line of disciplic succession, one cannot understand them. This knowledge is delivered to N&#257;rada by Lord Brahm&#257;, and the great saint N&#257;rada, along with his companion, Tumburu, distributes it all over the universe. Sometimes the Supreme Personality of Godhead is described as Uttama&#347;loka, one who is praised by beautiful poetry. N&#257;rada composes various poems to glorify Lord Ananta, and therefore the word <span class="Italic">sa&#7745;&#347;lokay&#257;m &#257;sa</span> (praised by selected poetry) is used in this verse.</div><A NAME="74443"></A><div class="Purport">The Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas in the Gau&#7693;&#299;ya-samprad&#257;ya belong to the disciplic succession stemming from Lord Brahm&#257;. Lord Brahm&#257; is the spiritual master of N&#257;rada, N&#257;rada is the spiritual master of Vy&#257;sadeva, and Vy&#257;sadeva wrote the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> as a commentary on the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra.</span> Therefore all devotees in the Gau&#7693;&#299;ya-samprad&#257;ya accept the activities of Lord Ananta related in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> as authentic, and they are thus benefited by going back home, back to Godhead. The contamination in the heart of a conditioned soul is like a huge accumulation of garbage created by the three modes of material nature, especially the modes of <span class="Italic">rajas</span> (passion) and <span class="Italic">tamas</span> (ignorance). This contamination becomes manifest in the form of lusty desires and greed for material possessions. As confirmed herein, unless one receives transcendental knowledge in disciplic succession, there is no question of his becoming purified of this contamination.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

The person in the second class, however, not only thinks his material body to be his self, but also commits all kinds of sinful activities to maintain his body. He cheats everyone to acquire money for his family and his self, and he becomes envious of others without reason. Such a person is thrown into the hell known as Raurava. If one simply considers his body to be his self, as do the animals, he is not very sinful. However, if one needlessly commits sins to maintain his body, he is put into the hell known as Raurava. This is the opinion of &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura. Although animals are certainly in the bodily concept of life, they do not commit any sins to maintain their bodies, mates or offspring. Therefore animals do not go to hell.

Now there are many. It doesn&rsquo;t matter which set of religious principles one follows: the only injunction is that he must follow them strictly.

Whether one is a Hindu, or a Mohammedan or a Christian, he should follow his own religious principles. However, if one concocts his own religious path within his mind, or if one follows no religious principles at all, he is punished in the hell known as Asi-patravana. In other words, a human being must follow some religious principles. If he does not follow any religious principles, he is no better than an animal. As Kali-yuga advances, people are becoming godless and taking up so-called secularism. They do not know the punishment awaiting them in Asi-patravana, as described in this verse.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Such insignificant creatures are unaware that their bites are painful to the human being. However, first-class human beings&mdash;br&#257;hma&#7751;as, k&#7779;atriyas and vai&#347;yas&mdash;are developed in consciousness, and therefore they know how painful it is to be killed. A human being endowed with knowledge certainly commits sin if he kills or torments insignificant creatures, who have no discrimination. The Supreme Lord punishes such a man by putting him into the hell known as Andhak&#363;pa, where he is attacked by all the birds and beasts, reptiles, mosquitoes, lice, worms, flies, and any other creatures he tormented during his life. They attack him from all sides, robbing him of the pleasure of sleep. Unable to rest, he constantly wanders about in the darkness. Thus in Andhak&#363;pa his suffering is just like that of a creature in the lower species.</div><A NAME="74755"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="74756"></A><div class="First">From this very instructive verse we learn that lower animals, created by the laws of nature to disturb the human being, are not subjected to punishment.

They cannot deviate from their prescribed rules and regulations. One of these states that they should never trouble any animal, even those that disturb human beings. Although a tiger is not sinful if he attacks another animal and eats its flesh, if a man with developed consciousness does so, he must be punished. In other words, a human being who does not use his developed consciousness but instead acts like an animal surely undergoes punishment in many different hells.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Who can equal me?&rdquo; His vision is twisted, and he is always afraid that someone will take his wealth. Indeed, he even suspects his superiors. His face and heart dry up at the thought of losing his wealth, and therefore he always looks like a wretched fiend. He is not in any way able to obtain actual happiness, and he does not know what it is to be free from anxiety. Because of the sinful things he does to earn money, augment his wealth and protect it, he is put into the hell called S&#363;c&#299;mukha, where the officials of Yamar&#257;ja punish him by stitching thread through his entire body like weavers manufacturing cloth.</div><A NAME="74958"></A><div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div><A NAME="74959"></A><div class="First">When one possesses more wealth than necessary, he certainly becomes very proud. This is the situation of men in modern civilization. According to the Vedic culture, <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> do not possess anything, whereas <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> possess riches, but only for performing sacrifices and other noble activities as prescribed in the Vedic injunctions. A <span class="Italic">vai&#347;ya</span> also earns money honestly through agriculture, cow protection and some trade. If a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> gets money, however, he will spend it lavishly, without discrimination, or simply accumulate it for no purpose. Because in this age there are no qualified <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as, k&#7779;atriyas</span> or <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas,</span> almost everyone is a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> (<span class="Italic">kalau &#347;&#363;dra-sambhava&#7717;</span>). Therefore the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> mentality is causing great harm to modern civilization. A <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> does not know how to use money to render transcendental loving service to the Lord. Money is also called <span class="Italic">lak&#7779;m&#299;,</span> and Lak&#7779;m&#299; is always engaged in the service of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. Wherever there is money, it must be engaged in the service of Lord N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. Everyone should use his money to spread the great transcendental movement of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. If one does not spend money for this purpose but accumulates more than necessary, he will certainly become proud of the money he illegally possesses. The money actually belongs to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who says in <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="index2ceb.html?g=2055">5.29</a>), <span class="Italic">bhokt&#257;ra&#7745; yaj&ntilde;a-tapas&#257;&#7745; sarva-loka-mahe&#347;varam:</span> &ldquo;I am the true enjoyer of sacrifices and penances, and I am the owner of all the planets.&rdquo; Therefore nothing belongs to anyone but K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. One who possesses more money than he needs should spend it for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Unless one does so, he will become puffed up because of his false possessions, and therefore he will be punished in the next life, as described herein.</div></td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

Learned scholars who have full knowledge of all the Vedic scriptures agree that the incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are innumerable. These incarnations are classified into two divisions, called <span class="Italic">pr&#257;bhava</span> and <span class="Italic">vaibhava.</span> According to the scriptures, <span class="Italic">pr&#257;bhava</span> incarnations are also classified in two divisions&mdash;those which are called eternal and those which are not vividly described. In this Fifth Canto of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> in Chapters Three through Six, there is a description of &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva, but there is not an expanded description of His spiritual activities. Therefore He is considered to belong to the second group of <span class="Italic">pr&#257;bhava</span> incarnations. In <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> First Canto, Chapter Three, verse 13. it is said:</div><A NAME="75012"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">a&#7779;&#7789;ame merudevy&#257;&#7745; tu<br>n&#257;bher j&#257;ta urukrama&#7717;<br>dar&#347;ayan vartma dh&#299;r&#257;&#7751;&#257;&#7745;<br>sarv&#257;&#347;rama-namask&#7771;tam</div></div><A NAME="75013"></A><div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u appeared in the eighth incarnation as the son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja N&#257;bhi [the son of &#256;gn&#299;dhra] and his wife Merudev&#299;.

Therefore one might ask how it might be possible that he passed stool and urine. The Gau&#7693;&#299;ya <span class="Italic">ved&#257;nta &#257;c&#257;rya</span> Baladeva Vidy&#257;bh&#363;&#7779;a&#7751;a has replied to this question in his book known as <span class="Italic">Siddh&#257;nta-ratna</span> (First Portion, texts 65&ndash;68). Imperfect men call attention to &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva&rsquo;s passing stool and urine as a subject matter for the study of nondevotees, who do not understand the spiritual position of a transcendental body. In this Fifth Canto of <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span></B> (<a href="index5be8.html?g=43084">5.6.11</a>) the illusioned and bewildered state of the materialists of this age is fully described. Elsewhere in Fifth Canto (5.5.19) &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva stated, <span class="Italic">ida&#7745; &#347;ar&#299;ram mama durvibh&#257;vyam:</span> &ldquo;This body of Mine is inconceivable for materialists.&rdquo; This is also confirmed by Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="indexa12b.html?g=3084">9.11</a>):</div><A NAME="75014"></A><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">avaj&#257;nanti m&#257;&#7745; m&#363;&#7693;h&#257;<br>m&#257;nu&#7779;&#299;&#7745; tanum &#257;&#347;ritam<br>para&#7745; bh&#257;vam aj&#257;nanto<br>mama bh&#363;ta-mahe&#347;varam</div></div><A NAME="75015"></A><div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form.

Therefore &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva has directly explained that His own body belongs to the spiritual platform. This being so. &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva did not actually pass stool and urine. Even though He superficially seemed to pass stool and urine, that was also transcendental and cannot be imitated by any common man. It is also stated in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> that the stool and urine of &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva were full of transcendental fragrance.

How can they be followers of &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva while they act against the Vedic principles? &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; has related that after hearing about the characteristics of Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva, the King of Ko&#7749;ka, Ve&#7749;ka and Ku&#7789;aka initiated a system of religious principles known as <span class="Italic">arhat.</span> These principles were not in accord with Vedic principles, and therefore they are called <span class="Italic">p&#257;&#7779;a&#7751;&#7693;a-dharma.</span> The members of the <span class="Italic">arhat</span> community considered &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva&rsquo;s activities material.
