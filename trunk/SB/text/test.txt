Kåñëa; adbhuta-karmaëä—whose activities are wonderful; kaàsäya—to
Kaàsa; atha—then; äha—spoke; bhagavän—the powerful sage;
näradaù—Närada; deva-darçanaù—whose vision is godly.
TRANSLATION
After Ariñöäsura had been killed by Kåñëa, who acts wonderfully, Närada
Muni went to speak to King Kaàsa. That powerful sage of godly vision
addressed the King as follows.
PURPORT
The term deva-darçana can be understood in many ways, all of which are
consistent with the context and purport of this narration. Deva means "God,"
and darçanaù means "seeing" or "an audience with a great personality." Thus
deva-darçana, a name for Närada Muni, indicates that Närada has attained the
perfection of seeing God, that getting Närada's audience is as good as getting
God's (since Närada is a pure representative of the Lord), and also that
Närada's audience is as good as that of the demigods, who are also known as
devas. That there are all these meanings of the term deva-darçanaù reveals
something of the richness of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam's language.
From the Puräëas, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has quoted twenty
verses describing a joking conversation between Rädhä and Kåñëa that took
place after Kåñëa had killed the demon Ariñöa. This conversation, so kindly
quoted by the äcärya, describes the origin of Rädhä-kuëòa and Çyäma-kuëòa,
Rädhä's and Kåñëa's bathing ponds. The verses are as follows:
mäsmän spåçädya våñabhärdana hanta mugdhä
ghoro 'suro 'yam ayi kåñëa tad apy ayaà gauù
våtro yathä dvija ihästy ayi niñkåtiù kià
çudhyed bhaväàs tri-bhuvana-sthita-tértha-kåcchrät
"The innocent young gopés said, 'Ah, Kåñëa, don't touch us now, O killer of a
bull! Alas, even though Ariñöa was a terrible demon, still he was a male cow, so
You will have to undergo atonement, just as Lord Indra did after killing
Våträsura. But how can You purify Yourself without going to the trouble of
visiting every single holy place in the three worlds?' "

"[Kåñëa replied,] 'Why should I have to wander throughout the entire universe?
I will at once bring all the countless pilgrimage places here and take My bath
in them. Just watch!' With this, Lord Mukunda struck His heel on the ground."
pätälato jalam idaà kila bhogavatyä

"[Then He said,] 'This is the water of the Bhogavaté River, coming from the
Pätäla region. And now, O holy places, all of you please come here!' When the
Supreme Lord had spoken these words, all the holy places went there and
appeared before Him. Kåñëa then addressed the gopés as follows."
térthäni paçyata harer vacasä tavaivaà
naiva pratéma iti tä atha tértha-varyäù
procuù kåtäïjali-puöä lavaëäbdhir asmi
kñéräbdhir asmi çåëutämara-dérghikäsmi
" 'See all the holy places!'
"But the gopés replied, 'We don't see them as You describe.'
"Then those best of holy places, joining their palms in supplication, spoke
up:
" 'I am the salt ocean.'
" 'I am the ocean of milk.'
" 'I am the Amara-dérghikä.' "

" 'I am the river Çoëa.'
" 'I am the Sindhu.'
" 'I am the Tämraparëé.'
" 'I am the holy place Puñkara.'
" 'I am the river Sarasvaté.'
" 'And we are the Godävaré, Yamunä and Revä rivers and the confluence of
rivers at Prayäga. Just see our waters!' "

"After purifying Himself by bathing, Lord Hari became quite arrogant and
said, 'I have produced a pond containing all the various holy places, whereas
you gopés must never have executed any religious duties on this earth for the
pleasure of Lord Brahmä.' Then Çrématé Rädhäräëé addressed Her girlfriends as
follows."

" 'I must create an even more beautiful pond. So go to work!' Having heard
these words, the gopés saw that Ariñöäsura's hooves had dug a shallow ditch just
west of Çré Kåñëa's pond."

"At that nearby spot, all the gopés began digging up lumps of soft mud with
their hands, and in this way a divine pond manifested in the short span of an
hour. Kåñëa was astonished to see the lake they produced."

"He said, 'Go ahead, lotus-eyed one. You and Your companions should fill
this pond with water from Mine.'
"But Rädhä replied, 'No, no, no, no! This is impossible, since the water of
Your pond is contaminated by Your terrible sin of killing a cow.' "

" 'I will have My countless gopé companions bring the pure water of the
Mänasa-gaìgä here in billions of pots. In this way I will fill this lake with My
own water and thus make its renown unequaled in the entire world.' "

"Lord Kåñëa then gestured to a heavenly personality who was an intimate
associate of all the holy places. Suddenly that person rose up out of Kåñëa's
pond and bowed down to the daughter of Çré Våñabhänu [Rädhäräëé]. Then,
with palms joined and tears pouring from his eyes, he began praying to Her in
devotion."

" 'O goddess, even Lord Brahmä himself, the knower of all scriptures,
cannot understand Your glories, nor can Lord Çiva or Lakñmé. Only Kåñëa, the
supreme goal of all human endeavor, can understand them, and thus He feels
obliged to personally make sure that You can wash away Your perspiration
when You are fatigued.' "

" 'He is always anointing Your lotus feet with nectarean cäru and yävaka
and decorating them with ankle bells, and He rejoices and feels most fortunate
simply by satisfying the tips of the toes of Your lotus feet. On His order we
have immediately come here to live in this most excellent pond, which He
created by one stroke of His heel. But only if You now feel satisfied with us
and bestow upon us Your merciful glance will the tree of our desire bear fruit.' "

"Hearing this prayer spoken by the representative of the full assembly of
holy places, Çré Rädhä was pleased and said, 'So, kindly tell Me your desire.'
"They then told Her plainly, 'Our lives would be successful if we could come
to Your pond. That is the benediction we desire.' "

"Glancing at Her beloved from the corners of Her eyes, the daughter of
Våñabhänu replied with a smile, 'Please come.' Her gopé companions all agreed
with Her decision and became immersed in the ocean of happiness. Indeed, the
beauty of all creatures, both mobile and stationary, was enhanced."

"Thus gaining the grace of Çrématé Rädhäräëé, the holy rivers and lakes in
Çré Kåñëa-kuëòa forcibly broke through its boundary walls and swiftly filled
Rädhä-kuëòa with their waters."

"Lord Hari then said, 'My dear Rädhä, may this pond of Yours become even
more world-renowned than Mine. I will always come here to bathe and to
enjoy My water pastimes. Indeed, this lake is as dear to Me as You are.' "

"Rädhä replied, 'I will come to bathe in Your pond as well, even though You
may kill hundreds of Ariñöa demons here. In the future, anyone who has
intense devotion for this lake, which is on the spot where You chastised
Ariñöäsura, and who bathes or resides here is sure to become very dear to Me.' "

"That night Lord Kåñëa initiated a räsa dance at Rädhä-kuëòa, generating a
torrent of the greatest mood of splendorous pleasure. Çré Kåñëa resembled a
cloud, and Çrématé Rädhäräëé a brilliant flash of lightning filling the sky with
abundant beauty. In this way Their divine glories permeated the expanses of
the three worlds."
As a final note, it should be mentioned that Närada Muni, being a great
sage, understood that the killing of Ariñöa more or less concluded the pastimes
of Kåñëa in Våndävana. Therefore Närada, anxious to facilitate the transferal
of Kåñëa's pastimes to Mathurä, approached Kaàsa and addressed him as
follows.
