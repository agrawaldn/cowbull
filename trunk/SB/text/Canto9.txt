1. King Sudyumna Becomes a Woman
This chapter describes how Sudyumna became a woman and how the
dynasty of Vaivasvata Manu was amalgamated with the Soma-vaàça, the
dynasty coming from the moon.
By the desire of Mahäräja Parékñit, Çukadeva Gosvämé told about the
dynasty of Vaivasvata Manu, who was formerly King Satyavrata, the ruler of
Draviòa. While describing this dynasty, he also described how the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, while lying down in the waters of devastation, gave
birth to Lord Brahmä from a lotus generated from His navel. From the mind of
Lord Brahmä, Maréci was generated, and his son was Kaçyapa. From Kaçyapa,
through Aditi, Vivasvän was generated, and from Vivasvän came Çräddhadeva
Manu, who was born from the womb of Saàjïä. Çräddhadeva's wife, Çraddhä,
gave birth to ten sons, such as Ikñväku and Någa.
Çräddhadeva, or Vaivasvata Manu, the father of Mahäräja Ikñväku, was
sonless before Ikñväku's birth, but by the grace of the great sage Vasiñöha he
performed a yajïa to satisfy Mitra and Varuëa. Then, although Vaivasvata
Manu wanted a son, by the desire of his wife he got a daughter named Ilä.
Manu, however, was not satisfied with the daughter. Consequently, for Manu's
satisfaction, the great sage Vasiñöha prayed for Ilä to be transformed into a boy,
and his prayer was fulfilled by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus Ilä
became a beautiful young man named Sudyumna.
Once upon a time, Sudyumna went on tour with his ministers. At the foot
of the mountain Sumeru there is a forest named Sukumära, and as soon as they
entered that forest, they were all transformed into women. When Mahäräja

Parékñit inquired from Çukadeva Gosvämé about the reason for this
transformation, Çukadeva Gosvämé described how Sudyumna, being
transformed into a woman, accepted Budha, the son of the moon, as her
husband and had a son named Purüravä. By the grace of Lord Çiva, Sudyumna
received the benediction that he would live one month as a woman and one
month as a man. Thus he regained his kingdom and had three sons, named
Utkala, Gaya and Vimala, who were all very religious. Thereafter, he entrusted
his kingdom to Purüravä and took the order of vänaprastha life.

Because Manu had no issue, he was pleased at the birth of the child, even
though a daughter, and gave her the name Ilä. Later, however, he was not very
satisfied to see the daughter instead of a son. Because he had no issue, he was
certainly very glad at the birth of Ilä, but his pleasure was temporary.

TRANSLATION
My lord, all of you are expert in chanting the Vedic mantras. How then has
the result been opposite to the one desired? This is a matter for lamentation.
There should not have been such a reversal of the results of the Vedic mantras.
PURPORT
In this age, the performance of yajïa has been forbidden because no one
can properly chant the Vedic mantras. If Vedic mantras are chanted properly,
the desire for which a sacrifice is performed must be successful. Therefore the
Hare Kåñëa chant is called the mahä-mantra, the great, exalted mantra above
all other Vedic mantras, because simply chanting the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra
brings so many beneficial effects. As explained by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu
(Çikñäñöaka 1):
ceto-darpaëa-märjanaà bhava-mahä-dävägni-nirväpaëaà
çreyaù-kairava-candrikä-vitaraëaà vidyä-vadhü-jévanam
änandämbudhi-vardhanaà prati-padaà pürëämåtäsvädanaà
sarvätma-snapanaà paraà vijayate çré-kåñëa-saìkértanam
[Cc. Antya 20.12]
"Glory to the Çré Kåñëa saìkértana, which cleanses the heart of all the dust
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
16
accumulated for years and extinguishes the fire of conditional life, of repeated
birth and death. This saìkértana movement is the prime benediction for
humanity at large because it spreads the rays of the benediction moon. It is the
life of all transcendental knowledge. It increases the ocean of transcendental
bliss, and it enables us to fully taste the nectar for which we are always
anxious."
Therefore, the best performance of yajïa given to us is the
saìkértana-yajïa. Yajïaiù saìkértana-präyair yajanti hi sumedhasaù (SB 11.5.32).
Those who are intelligent take advantage of the greatest yajïa in this age by
chanting the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra in congregation. When the Hare Kåñëa
mantra is chanted by many men together, the chanting is called saìkértana,
and as a result of such a yajïa there will be clouds in the sky (yajïäd bhavati
parjanyaù [Bg. 3.14]). In these days of drought, people can gain relief from
scarcity of rain and food by the simple method of the Hare Kåñëa yajïa.
Indeed, this can relieve all of human society. At present there are droughts
throughout Europe and America, and people are suffering, but if people take
this Kåñëa consciousness movement seriously, if they stop their sinful activities
and chant the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra, all their problems will be solved
without difficulty. In other processes of yajïa there are difficulties because
there are no learned scholars who can chant the mantras perfectly well, nor is
it possible to secure the ingredients to perform the yajïa. Because human
society is poverty-stricken and men are devoid of Vedic knowledge and the
power to chant the Vedic mantras, the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra is the only
shelter. People should be intelligent enough to chant it. Yajïaiù
saìkértana-präyair yajanti hi sumedhasaù [SB 11.5.32]. Those whose brains are
dull cannot understand this chanting, nor can they take to it.

SYNONYMS
yüyam—of all you; brahma-vidaù—completely in awareness of the Absolute
Truth; yuktäù—self-controlled and well balanced; tapasä—by dint of austerity
and penances; dagdha-kilbiñäù—all kinds of material contamination having
been burnt out; kutaù—then how; saìkalpa-vaiñamyam—discrepancy in the
matter of determination; anåtam—false promise, false statement;
vibudheñu—in the society of the demigods; iva—or.
TRANSLATION
You are all self-controlled, well balanced in mind, and aware of the Absolute
Truth. And because of austerities and penances you are completely cleansed of
all material contamination. Your words, like those of the demigods, are never
baffled. Then how is it possible that your determination has failed?
PURPORT
We have learned from many Vedic literatures that a benediction or curse
given by the demigods never proves false. By performing austerities and
penances, by controlling the senses and mind, and by achieving full knowledge
of the Absolute Truth, one is fully cleansed of material contamination. Then
one's words and blessings, like those of the demigods, are never a failure.

one forest to another.
PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gétä (2.22) it is said:
väsäàsi jérëäni yathä vihäya
naväni gåhëäti naro 'paräëi
tathä saréräëi vihäya jérëäny
anyäni saàyäti naväni dehé
"As a person puts on new garments, giving up old ones, the soul accepts new
material bodies, giving up the old and useless ones."
The body is just like a dress, and here this is proved. Sudyumna and his
associates were all male, which means that their souls were covered by male
dress, but now they became female, which means that their dress was changed.
The soul, however, remains the same. It is said that by modern medical
treatment a male can be transformed into a female, and a female into a male.
The body, however, has no connection with the soul. The body can be
changed, either in this life or the next. Therefore, one who has knowledge of
the soul and how the soul transmigrates from one body to another does not pay
attention to the body, which is nothing but a covering dress. Paëòitäù
sama-darçinaù [Bg. 5.18]. Such a person sees the soul, which is part and parcel
of the Supreme Lord. Therefore he is a sama-darçi, a learned person.

The word gotrajaù is significant in this connection. Brähmaëas generally
act as spiritual masters of two dynasties. One is their disciplic succession, and
the other is the dynasty born of their semen. Both descendants belong to the
same gotra, or dynasty. In the Vedic system we sometimes find that both
brähmaëas and kñatriyas and even vaiçyas come in the disciplic succession of
the same åñis. Because the gotra and dynasty are one, there is no difference
between the disciples and the family born of the semen. The same system still
prevails in Indian society, especially in regard to marriage, for which the gotra
is calculated. Here the word gotrajaù refers to those born in the same dynasty,
whether they be disciples or members of the family.

Thereafter, when the time was ripe, when Sudyumna, the king of the world,
was sufficiently old, he delivered the entire kingdom to his son Purüravä and
entered the forest.
PURPORT
According to the Vedic system, one within the institution of varëa and
äçrama must leave his family life after he reaches fifty years of age (païcäçad
ürdhvaà vanaà vrajet). Thus Sudyumna followed the prescribed regulations of
varëäçrama by leaving the kingdom and going to the forest to complete his
spiritual life.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, First Chapter, of the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "King Sudyumna Becomes a Woman."
2. The Dynasties of the Sons of Manu
This Second Chapter describes the dynasties of the sons of Manu, headed
by Karüña.
After Sudyumna accepted the order of vänaprastha and departed for the
forest, Vaivasvata Manu, being desirous of sons, worshiped the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and consequently begot ten sons like Mahäräja
Ikñväku, all of whom were like their father. One of these sons, Påñadhra, was
engaged in the duty of protecting cows at night with a sword in his hand.
Following the order of his spiritual master, he would stand in this way for the
entire night. Once, in the darkness of night, a tiger seized a cow from the
cowshed, and when Påñadhra came to know this, he took a sword in his hand
and followed the tiger. Unfortunately, when he finally approached the tiger,
he could not distinguish between the cow and the tiger in the dark, and thus
he killed the cow. Because of this, his spiritual master cursed him to take birth
in a çüdra family, but Påñadhra practiced mystic yoga, and in bhakti-yoga he
worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then he voluntarily entered a
blazing forest fire, thus relinquishing his material body and going back home,
back to Godhead.
Kavi, the youngest son of Manu, was a great devotee of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead from his very childhood. From Manu's son known as
Karüña, a sect of kñatriyas known as Kärüñas was generated. Manu also had a
son known as Dhåñöa, from whom another sect of kñatriyas was generated, but
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
38
although they were born of one who had the qualities of a kñatriya, they
became brähmaëas. From Någa, another son of Manu, came the sons and
grandsons known as Sumati, Bhütajyoti and Vasu. From Vasu, in succession,
came Pratéka, and from him came Oghavän. Descending in order from the
seminal dynasty of Nariñyanta, another son of Manu, were Citrasena, Åkña,
Méòhvän, Pürëa, Indrasena, Vétihotra, Satyaçravä, Uruçravä, Devadatta and
Agniveçya. From the kñatriya known as Agniveçya came the celebrated
brähmaëa dynasty known as Ägniveçyäyana. From the seminal dynasty of
Diñöa, another son of Manu, came Näbhäga, and from him in succession came
Bhalandana, Vatsapréti, Präàçu, Pramati, Khanitra, Cäkñuña, Viviàçati,
Rambha, Khanénetra, Karandhama, Avékñit, Marutta, Dama, Räjyavardhana,
Sudhåti, Nara, Kevala, Dhundhumän, Vegavän, Budha and Tåëabindu. In this
way, many sons and grandsons were born in this dynasty. From Tåëabindu
came a daughter named Ilavilä, from whom Kuvera took birth. Tåëabindu also
had three sons, named Viçäla, Çünyabandhu and Dhümraketu. The son of
Viçäla was Hemacandra, his son was Dhümräkña, and his son was Saàyama.
The sons of Saàyama were Devaja and Kåçäçva. Kåçäçva's son, Somadatta,
performed an Açvamedha sacrifice, and by worshiping the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Viñëu, he achieved the supreme perfection of going
back home, back to Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Among these sons, Påñadhra, following the order of his spiritual master, was
engaged as a protector of cows. He would stand all night with a sword to give
the cows protection.
PURPORT
One who becomes véräsana takes the vow to stand all night with a sword to
give protection to the cows. Because Påñadhra was engaged in this way, it is to
be understood that he had no dynasty. We can further understand from this
vow accepted by Påñadhra how essential it is to protect the cows. Some son of a
kñatriya would take this vow to protect the cows from ferocious animals, even
at night. What then is to be said of sending cows to slaughterhouses? This is
the most sinful activity in human society.

TRANSLATION
Although Påñadhra had committed the sin unknowingly, his family priest,
Vasiñöha, cursed him, saying, "In your next life you shall not be able to become
a kñatriya. Instead, you shall take birth as a çüdra because of killing the cow."
PURPORT
It appears that Vasiñöha was not free from tamo-guëa, the mode of
ignorance. As the family priest or spiritual master of Påñadhra, Vasiñöha should
have taken Påñadhra's offense very lightly, but instead Vasiñöha cursed him to
become a çüdra. It is the duty of a family priest not to curse a disciple but to
give him relief through the performance of some sort of atonement. Vasiñöha,
however, did just the opposite. Therefore Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté

he gave full attention to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Väsudeva, who is

traveling all over the world, without affection for material activities, as if he
were deaf, dumb and blind.

The Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä (4.9):

"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities
does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but
attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna." Påñadhra, because of his karma, was
cursed to take his next birth as a çüdra, but because he took to saintly life,
specifically concentrating his mind always upon the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, he became a pure devotee. Immediately after giving up his body in
the fire, he reached the spiritual world, as mentioned in Bhagavad-gétä (mäm
eti), as a result of his devotional situation. Devotional service performed by
thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is so powerful that although

Påñadhra was cursed he avoided the terrible consequence of becoming a çüdra
and instead returned home, back to Godhead. As stated in Brahma-saàhitä
(5.54):

Those who engage in devotional service are unaffected by the results of their
material activities. Otherwise, everyone, from the smallest microbe up to the
King of heaven, Indra, is subject to the laws of karma. A pure devotee, being
always engaged in the service of the Lord, is exempt from these laws.

Närada (SB 7.11.35):
yasya yal lakñaëaà proktaà
puàso varëäbhivyaïjakam
yad anyaträpi dåçyeta
tat tenaiva vinirdiçet
If the qualities of one group are found in the men of another, those men
should be recognized by their qualities, by their symptoms, not by the caste of
the family in which they were born. Birth is not at all important; it is one's
qualities that are stressed in all Vedic literature.

TRANSLATION
Diñöa had a son by the name Näbhäga. This Näbhäga, who was different
from the Näbhäga described later, became a vaiçya by occupational duty. The
son of Näbhäga was known as Bhalandana, the son of Bhalandana was
Vatsapréti, and his son was Präàçu. Präàçu's son was Pramati, Pramati's son
was Khanitra, Khanitra's son was Cäkñuña, and his son was Viviàçati.
PURPORT
From Manu, one son became a kñatriya, another a brähmaëa, and another a
vaiçya. This confirms the statement by Närada Muni, yasya yal lakñaëaà
proktaà puàso varëäbhivyaïjakam (SB 7.11.35). One should always remember
that brähmaëas, kñatriyas and vaiçyas should never be regarded as members of a
caste by birth. A brähmaëa may be changed into a kñatriya, and a kñatriya into
a brähmaëa. Similarly, a brähmaëa or kñatriya may be changed into a vaiçya,
and a vaiçya into a brähmaëa or kñatriya. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä
(cätur-varëyaà mayä såñöaà guëa-karma-vibhägaçaù [Bg. 4.13]). So one is a
brähmaëa, kñatriya or vaiçya never by birth, but by quality. There is a great
need of brähmaëas. Therefore, in the Kåñëa consciousness movement, we are
trying to train some brähmaëas to guide human society. Because at present
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
59
there is a scarcity of brähmaëas, the brain of human society is lost. Because
practically everyone is a çüdra, no one at the present moment can guide the
members of society to the proper path by which to achieve perfection in life.

maintained the celebrated position of King Tåëabindu.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Second Chapter, of the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Dynasties of the Sons of Manu."
3. The Marriage of Sukanyä and Cyavana Muni
This chapter describes the dynasty of Çaryäti, another son of Manu, and
also tells about Sukanyä and Revaté.
Devajïa Çaryäti gave instructions about what to do in the ritualistic
ceremony observed on the second day of the yajïa of the Aìgirasas. One day,
Çaryäti, along with his daughter, known as Sukanyä, went to the äçrama of
Cyavana Muni. There Sukanyä saw two glowing substances within a hole of
earthworms, and by chance she pierced those two glowing substances. As soon
as she did this, blood began to ooze from that hole. Consequently, King Çaryäti
and his companions suffered from constipation and inability to pass urine.
When the King asked why circumstances had suddenly changed, he found that
Sukanyä was the cause of this misfortune. Then they all offered prayers to
Cyavana Muni just to satisfy him according to his own desire, and Devajïa
Çaryäti offered his daughter to Cyavana Muni, who was a very old man.
When the heavenly physicians the Açviné-kumära brothers once visited
Cyavana Muni, the muni requested them to give him back his youth. These
two physicians took Cyavana Muni to a particular lake, in which they bathed
and regained full youth. After this, Sukanyä could not distinguish her
husband. She then surrendered unto the Açviné-kumäras, who were very
satisfied with her chastity and who therefore introduced her again to her
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
69
husband. Cyavana Muni then engaged King Çaryäti in performing the
soma-yajïa and gave the Açviné-kumäras the privilege to drink soma-rasa. The
King of heaven, Lord Indra, became very angry at this, but he could do no
harm to Çaryäti. Henceforward, the Açviné-kumära physicians were able to
share in the soma-rasa.
Çaryäti later had three sons, named Uttänabarhi, Änarta and Bhüriñeëa.
Änarta had one son, whose name was Revata. Revata had one hundred sons, of
whom the eldest was Kakudmé. Kakudmé was advised by Lord Brahmä to offer
his beautiful daughter, Revaté, to Baladeva, who belongs to the viñëu-tattva
category. After doing this, Kakudmé retired from family life and entered the
forest of Badarikäçrama to execute austerities and penances.

great sage Cyavana Muni everything about how his daughter had ignorantly
committed such an offense. The muni, however, inquired from the King
whether the daughter was married. In this way, the King, understanding the
purpose of the great sage Cyavana Muni (tad-abhipräyam äjïäya), immediately
gave the muni his daughter in charity and escaped the danger of being cursed.
Thus with the permission of the great sage the King returned home.

TRANSLATION
Cyavana Muni was very irritable, but since Sukanyä had gotten him as her
husband, she dealt with him carefully, according to his mood. Knowing his
mind, she performed service to him without being bewildered.
PURPORT
This is an indication of the relationship between husband and wife. A great
personality like Cyavana Muni has the temperament of always wanting to be
in a superior position. Such a person cannot submit to anyone. Therefore,
Cyavana Muni had an irritable temperament. His wife, Sukanyä, could
understand his attitude, and under the circumstances she treated him
accordingly. If any wife wants to be happy with her husband, she must try to
understand her husband's temperament and please him. This is victory for a
woman. Even in the dealings of Lord Kåñëa with His different queens, it has
been seen that although the queens were the daughters of great kings, they
placed themselves before Lord Kåñëa as His maidservants. However great a
woman may be, she must place herself before her husband in this way; that is
to say, she must be ready to carry out her husband's orders and please him in all
circumstances. Then her life will be successful. When the wife becomes as
irritable as the husband, their life at home is sure to be disturbed or ultimately
completely broken. In the modern day, the wife is never submissive, and
therefore home life is broken even by slight incidents. Either the wife or the
husband may take advantage of the divorce laws. According to the Vedic law,
however, there is no such thing as divorce laws, and a woman must be trained
to be submissive to the will of her husband. Westerners contend that this is a
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
78
slave mentality for the wife, but factually it is not; it is the tactic by which a
woman can conquer the heart of her husband, however irritable or cruel he
may be. In this case we clearly see that although Cyavana Muni was not young
but indeed old enough to be Sukanyä's grandfather and was also very irritable,
Sukanyä, the beautiful young daughter of a king, submitted herself to her old
husband and tried to please him in all respects. Thus she was a faithful and
chaste wife.

Thereafter, some time having passed, the Açviné-kumära brothers, the

offering them respectful obeisances, Cyavana Muni requested them to give him

youthful life, for they were able to do so.
PURPORT
The heavenly physicians like the Açviné-kumäras could give youthful life
even to one who was advanced in age. Indeed, great yogés, with their mystic
powers, can even bring a dead body back to life if the structure of the body is
in order. We have already discussed this in connection with Bali Mahäräja's
soldiers and their treatment by Çukräcärya. Modern medical science has not
yet discovered how to bring a dead body back to life or bring youthful energy
to an old body, but from these verses we can understand that such treatment is
possible if one is able to take knowledge from the Vedic information. The
Açviné-kumäras were expert in Äyur-veda, as was Dhanvantari. In every
department of material science, there is a perfection to be achieved, and to
achieve it one must consult the Vedic literature. The highest perfection is to
become a devotee of the Lord. To attain this perfection, one must consult
Çrémad-Bhägavatam, which is understood to be the ripe fruit of the Vedic
desire tree (nigama-kalpa-taror galitaà phalam [SB 1.1.3]).

TRANSLATION
O unchaste girl, what is this that you have desired to do? You have cheated
the most respectable husband, who is honored by everyone, for I see that
because he was old, diseased and therefore unattractive, you have left his
company to accept as your husband this young man, who appears to be a beggar
from the street.
PURPORT
This shows the values of Vedic culture. According to the circumstances,
Sukanyä had been given a husband who was too old to be compatible with her.
Because Cyavana Muni was diseased and very old, he was certainly unfit for
the beautiful daughter of King Çaryäti. Nonetheless, her father expected her to
be faithful to her husband. When he suddenly saw that his daughter had
accepted someone else, even though the man was young and handsome, he
immediately chastised her as asaté, unchaste, because he assumed that she had
accepted another man in the presence of her husband. According to Vedic
culture, even if a young woman is given an old husband, she must respectfully
serve him. This is chastity. It is not that because she dislikes her husband she
may give him up and accept another. This is against Vedic culture. According
to Vedic culture, a woman must accept the husband given to her by her
parents and remain chaste and faithful to him. Therefore King Çaryäti was
surprised to see a young man by the side of Sukanyä.

in the respectable families of brähmaëas, kñatriyas and vaiçyas even today; only
the çüdras are degraded in this matter. For a woman of the brähmaëa, kñatriya
or vaiçya class to accept another husband in the presence of the husband she
has married, or to file for divorce or accept a boyfriend or paramour, is
unacceptable in the Vedic culture. Therefore King Çaryäti, who did not know
the real facts of Cyavana Muni's transformation, was surprised to see the
behavior of his daughter.

Sukanyä, however, being very proud of her chastity, smiled upon hearing the

PURPORT
Although the father chastised the daughter, assuming that she had accepted
another husband, the daughter knew that she was completely honest and
chaste, and therefore she was smiling. When she explained that her husband,
Cyavana Muni, had now been transformed into a young man, she was very
proud of her chastity, and thus she smiled as she talked with her father.

4. Ambaréña Mahäräja Offended by Durväsä Muni
This chapter describes the history of Mahäräja Nabhaga, of his son
Näbhäga, and of Mahäräja Ambaréña.
The son of Manu was Nabhaga, and his son Näbhäga lived for many years
in the gurukula. In Näbhäga's absence, his brothers did not consider his share
of the kingdom, but instead divided the property among themselves. When
Näbhäga returned home, his brothers bestowed upon him their father as his
share, but when Näbhäga went to his father and told him about the dealings of
the brothers, his father informed him that this was cheating and advised him
that for his livelihood he should go to the sacrificial arena and describe two
mantras to be chanted there. Näbhäga executed the order of his father, and
thus Aìgirä and other great saintly persons gave him all the money collected
in that sacrifice. To test Näbhäga, Lord Çiva challenged his claim to the
wealth, but when Lord Çiva was satisfied by Näbhäga's behavior, Lord Çiva
offered him all the riches.
From Näbhäga was born Ambaréña, the most powerful and celebrated
devotee. Mahäräja Ambaréña was the emperor of the entire world, but he
considered his opulence temporary. Indeed, knowing that such material
opulence is the cause of downfall into conditional life, he was unattached to
this opulence. He engaged his senses and mind in the service of the Lord. This
process is called yukta-vairägya, or feasible renunciation, which is quite
suitable for worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because Mahäräja
Ambaréña, as the emperor, was immensely opulent, he performed devotional
service with great opulence, and therefore, despite his wealth, he had no
attachment to his wife, children or kingdom. He constantly engaged his senses
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
103
and mind in the service of the Lord. Therefore, to say nothing of enjoying
material opulence, he never desired even liberation.
Once Mahäräja Ambaréña was worshiping the Supreme Personality of
Godhead in Våndävana, observing the vow of Dvädaçé. On Dvädaçé, the day
after Ekädaçé, when he was about to break his Ekädaçé fast, the great mystic
yogé Durväsä appeared in his house and became his guest. King Ambaréña
respectfully received Durväsä Muni, and Durväsä Muni, after accepting his
invitation to eat there, went to bathe in the Yamunä River at noontime.
Because he was absorbed in samädhi, he did not come back very soon.
Mahäräja Ambaréña, however, upon seeing that the time to break the fast was
passing, drank a little water, in accordance with the advice of learned
brähmaëas, just to observe the formality of breaking the fast. By mystic power,
Durväsä Muni could understand that this had happened, and he was very
angry. When he returned he began to chastise Mahäräja Ambaréña, but he was
not satisfied, and finally he created from his hair a demon appearing like the
fire of death. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, is always the
protector of His devotee, and to protect Mahäräja Ambaréña, He sent His disc,
the Sudarçana cakra, which immediately vanquished the fiery demon and then
pursued Durväsä, who was so envious of Mahäräja Ambaréña. Durväsä fled to
Brahmaloka, Çivaloka and all the other higher planets, but he could not
protect himself from the wrath of the Sudarçana cakra. Finally he went to the
spiritual world and surrendered to Lord Näräyaëa, but Lord Näräyaëa could
not excuse a person who had offended a Vaiñëava. To be excused from such an
offense, one must submit to the Vaiñëava whom he has offended. There is no
other way to be excused. Thus Lord Näräyaëa advised Durväsä to return to
Mahäräja Ambaréña and beg his pardon.

Çukadeva Gosvämé said: The son of Nabhaga named Näbhäga lived for a
long time at the place of his spiritual master. Therefore, his brothers thought
that he was not going to become a gåhastha and would not return.
Consequently, without providing a share for him, they divided the property of
their father among themselves. When Näbhäga returned from the place of his
spiritual master, they gave him their father as his share.
PURPORT
There are two kinds of brahmacärés. One may return home, marry and
become a householder, whereas the other, known as båhad-vrata, takes a vow to
remain a brahmacäré perpetually. The båhad-vrata brahmacäré does not return
from the place of the spiritual master; he stays there, and later he directly takes

master, his brothers thought that he had taken båhadvrata-brahmacarya.
Therefore, they did not preserve his share, and when he returned they gave
him their father as his share.

Näbhäga's father continued: "Go to those great souls and describe two Vedic
hymns pertaining to Vaiçvadeva. When the great sages have completed the
sacrifice and are going to the heavenly planets, they will give you the remnants
of the money they have received from the sacrifice. Therefore, go there
immediately." Thus Näbhäga acted exactly according to the advice of his father,
and the great sages of the Aìgirä dynasty gave him all their wealth and then
went to the heavenly planets.

accordance with this, Näbhäga inquired from his father.

TRANSLATION
Çukadeva Gosvämé said: Mahäräja Ambaréña, the most fortunate personality,
achieved the rule of the entire world, consisting of seven islands, and achieved
inexhaustible, unlimited opulence and prosperity on earth. Although such a
position is rarely obtained, Mahäräja Ambaréña did not care for it at all, for he
knew very well that all such opulence is material. Like that which is imagined
in a dream, such opulence will ultimately be destroyed. The King knew that any
nondevotee who attains such opulence merges increasingly into material
nature's mode of darkness.
PURPORT
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
117
For a devotee material opulence is insignificant, whereas for a nondevotee
material opulence is the cause of increasing bondage, for a devotee knows that
anything material is temporary, whereas a nondevotee regards the temporary
so-called happiness as everything and forgets the path of self-realization. Thus
for the nondevotee material opulence is a disqualification for spiritual
advancement.

TRANSLATION
Mahäräja Ambaréña always engaged his mind in meditating upon the lotus

cleansing the Lord's temple, and his ears in hearing the words spoken by Kåñëa

or about Kåñëa. He engaged his eyes in seeing the Deity of Kåñëa, Kåñëa's
temples and Kåñëa's places like Mathurä and Våndävana, he engaged his sense
of touch in touching the bodies of the Lord's devotees, he engaged his sense of
smell in smelling the fragrance of tulasé offered to the Lord, and he engaged his
tongue in tasting the Lord's prasäda. He engaged his legs in walking to the holy
places and temples of the Lord, his head in bowing down before the Lord, and
all his desires in serving the Lord, twenty-four hours a day. Indeed, Mahäräja
Ambaréña never desired anything for his own sense gratification. He engaged all
his senses in devotional service, in various engagements related to the Lord.
This is the way to increase attachment for the Lord and be completely free from
all material desires.
PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gétä (7.1) the Lord recommends, mayy äsakta-manäù pärtha
yogaà yuïjan mad-äçrayaù. This indicates that one must execute devotional
service under the guidance of a devotee or directly under the guidance of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is not possible, however, to train oneself
without guidance from the spiritual master. Therefore, according to the
instructions of Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé, the first business of a devotee is to accept
a bona fide spiritual master who can train him to engage his various senses in
rendering transcendental service to the Lord. The Lord also says in
Bhagavad-gétä (7.1), asaàçayaà samagraà mäà yathä jïäsyasi tac chåëu. In
other words, if one wants to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead
in completeness, one must follow the prescriptions given by Kåñëa by following
in the footsteps of Mahäräja Ambaréña. It is said, håñékeëa håñékeça-sevanaà
bhaktir ucyate: [Cc. Madhya 19.170] bhakti means to engage the senses in the
service of the master of the senses, Kåñëa, who is called Håñékeça or Acyuta.
These words are used in these verses. Acyuta-sat-kathodaye,
håñékeça-padäbhivandane. The words Acyuta and Håñékeça are also used in
Bhagavad-gétä. Bhagavad-gétä is kåñëa-kathä spoken directly by Kåñëa, and
Çrémad-Bhägavatam is also kåñëa-kathä because everything described in the
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
121
Bhägavatam is in relationship with Kåñëa.

Godhead, Kåñëa, who is the enjoyer of everything and is beyond the perception
of material senses. He certainly took advice from brähmaëas who were faithful
devotees of the Lord, and thus he ruled the planet earth without difficulty.

As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (5.29):

People are very much anxious to live in peace and prosperity in this material
world, and here in Bhagavad-gétä the peace formula is given personally by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead: everyone should understand that Kåñëa, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the ultimate proprietor of all the planets
and is therefore the enjoyer of all activities, political, social, cultural, religious,
economic and so on. The Lord has given perfect advice in Bhagavad-gétä, and
Ambaréña Mahäräja, as the ideal executive head, ruled the entire world as a
Vaiñëava, taking advice from Vaiñëava brähmaëas. The çästras enjoin that
even though a brähmaëa may be well versed in the occupational brahminical
duties and may be very learned in Vedic knowledge, he cannot give advice as a
guru until he is a Vaiñëava.

Therefore, as indicated here by the words tan-niñöha-vipräbhihitaù, Mahäräja
Ambaréña took advice from brähmaëas who were pure devotees of the Lord, for
ordinary brähmaëas who are merely learned scholars or experts in performing
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
123
ritualistic ceremonies are not competent to give advice.
In modern times, there are legislative assemblies whose members are
authorized to make laws for the welfare of the state, but according to this
description of the kingdom of Mahäräja Ambaréña, the country or the world
should be ruled by a chief executive whose advisors are all devotee brähmaëas.
Such advisors or members of the legislative assembly should not be professional
politicians, nor should they be selected by the ignorant public. Rather, they
should be appointed by the king. When the king, the executive head of the
state, is a devotee and he follows the instructions of devotee brähmaëas in
ruling the country, everyone will be peaceful and prosperous. When the king
and his advisors are perfect devotees, nothing can be wrong in the state. All
the citizens should become devotees of the Lord, and then their good character
will automatically follow.

"One who has unflinching devotion for the Personality of Godhead has all the
good qualities of the demigods. But one who is not a devotee of the Lord has
only material qualifications that are of little value. This is because he is
hovering on the mental plane and is certain to be attracted by the glaring
material energy." (SB 5.18.12) Citizens under the guidance of a Kåñëa conscious
king will become devotees, and then there will be no need to enact new laws
every day to reform the way of life in the state. If the citizens are trained to
become devotees, they will automatically become peaceful and honest, and if
they are guided by a devoted king advised by devotees, the state will not be in
the material world but in the spiritual world. All the states of the world should
therefore follow the ideal of the rule or administration of Mahäräja Ambaréña,
as described here.

TRANSLATION
In desert countries where there flowed the River Sarasvaté, Mahäräja
Ambaréña performed great sacrifices like the açvamedha-yajïa and thus satisfied
the master of all yajïas, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such sacrifices
were performed with great opulence and suitable paraphernalia and with
contributions of dakñiëä to the brähmaëas, who were supervised by great
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
125
personalities like Vasiñöha, Asita and Gautama, representing the king, the
performer of the sacrifices.
PURPORT
When one performs ritualistic sacrifices as prescribed in the Vedas, one
needs expert brähmaëas known as yäjïika-brähmaëas. In Kali-yuga, however,
there is a scarcity of such brähmaëas. Therefore in Kali-yuga the sacrifice
recommended in çästra is saìkértana-yajïa (yajïaiù saìkértana-präyair yajanti
hi sumedhasaù [SB 11.5.32]). Instead of spending money unnecessarily on
performing yajïas impossible to perform in this age of Kali because of the
scarcity of yäjïika-brähmaëas, one who is intelligent performs
saìkértana-yajïa. Without properly performed yajïas to satisfy the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, there will be scarcity of rain (yajïäd bhavati parjanyaù
[Bg. 3.14]). Therefore the performance of yajïa is essential. Without yajïa
there will be a scarcity of rain, and because of this scarcity, no food grains will
be produced, and there will be famines. It is the duty of the king, therefore, to
perform different types of yajïas, such as the açvamedha-yajïa, to maintain the
production of food grains. Annäd bhavanti bhütäni. Without food grains, both
men and animals will starve. Therefore yajïa is necessary for the state to
perform because by yajïa the people in general will be fed sumptuously. The
brähmaëas and yäjïika priests should be sufficiently paid for their expert
service. This payment is called dakñiëä. Ambaréña Mahäräja, as the head of the
state, performed all these yajïas through great personalities like Vasiñöha,
Gautama and Asita. Personally, however, he was engaged in devotional
service, as mentioned before (sa vai manaù kåñëa-padäravindayoù [SB 9.4.18]).
The king or head of state must see that things go on well under proper
guidance, and he must be an ideal devotee, as exemplified by Mahäräja
Ambaréña. It is the duty of the king to see that food grains are produced even
in desert countries, what to speak of elsewhere.

The citizens of the state of Mahäräja Ambaréña were accustomed to chanting
and hearing about the glorious activities of the Personality of Godhead. Thus
they never aspired to be elevated to the heavenly planets, which are extremely
dear even to the demigods.
PURPORT
A pure devotee who has been trained in the practice of chanting and
hearing the holy name of the Lord and His fame, qualities, form, paraphernalia
and so on is never interested in elevation to the heavenly planets, even though
such places are extremely dear even to the demigods.

of Godhead, Näräyaëa, never fear any condition of life. The heavenly planets,
liberation and the hellish planets are all the same to a devotee." (SB 6.17.28) A
devotee is always situated in the spiritual world. Therefore he does not desire
anything. He is known as akäma, or desireless, because he has nothing to desire
except to render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Because Mahäräja Ambaréña was a most exalted devotee of the Lord,
he trained his subjects in such a way that the citizens in his state were not
interested in anything material, including even the happiness of the heavenly
planets.

129
Those who are saturated with the transcendental happiness of rendering
service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead are uninterested even in the
achievements of great mystics, for such achievements do not enhance the
transcendental bliss felt by a devotee who always thinks of Kåñëa within the
core of his heart.
PURPORT
A pure devotee is uninterested not only in elevation to the higher
planetary systems but even in the perfections of mystic yoga. Real perfection is
devotional service. The happiness derived from merging in the impersonal
Brahman and the happiness derived from the eight perfections of mystic yoga
(aëimä, laghimä, präpti and so on) do not give any pleasure to the devotee. As
stated by Çréla Prabodhänanda Sarasvaté:
kaivalyaà narakäyate tridaça-pür äkäça-puñpäyate
durdäntendriya-käla-sarpa-paöalé protkhäta-daàñöräyate
viçvaà pürëa-sukhäyate vidhi-mahendrädiç ca kéöäyate
yat käruëya-kaöäkña-vaibhavavatäà taà gauram eva stumaù
(Caitanya-candrämåta 5)
When a devotee has achieved the position of rendering transcendental loving
service to the Lord through the mercy of Lord Caitanya, he thinks the
impersonal Brahman to be no better than hell, and he regards material
happiness in the heavenly planets to be like a will-o'-the-wisp. As far as the
perfection of mystic powers is concerned, a devotee compares it to a venomous
snake with no teeth. A mystic yogé is especially concerned with controlling the
senses, but because the senses of a devotee are engaged in the service of the
Lord (håñékeëa håñékeça-sevanaà bhaktir ucyate [Cc. Madhya 19.170]) there is no
need for separate control of the senses. For those who are materially engaged,
control of the senses is required, but a devotee's senses are all engaged in the
service of the Lord, which means that they are already controlled. paraà dåñövä
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
130
nivartate (Bg. 2.59). A devotee's senses are not attracted by material
enjoyment. And even though the material world is full of misery, the devotee
considers this material world to be also spiritual because everything is engaged
in the service of the Lord. The difference between the spiritual world and
material world is the mentality of service. Nirbandhaù kåñëa-sambandhe
yuktaà vairägyam ucyate. When there is no mentality of service to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, one's activities are material.
präpaïci-katayä buddhyä
hari-sambandhi-vastunaù
mumukñubhiù parityägo
vairägyaà phalgu kathyate
(Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 1.2.256)
That which is not engaged in the service of the Lord is material, and nothing
thus engaged should be given up. In the construction of a high skyscraper and
the construction of a temple, there may be the same enthusiasm, but the
endeavors are different, for one is material and the other spiritual. Spiritual
activities should not be confused with material activities and given up.
Nothing connected with Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is
material. A devotee who considers all this is always situated in spiritual
activities, and therefore he is no longer attracted by material activities (paraà
dåñövä nivartate [Bg. 9.59]).

TRANSLATION
The king of this planet, Mahäräja Ambaréña, thus performed devotional
service to the Lord and in this endeavor practiced severe austerity. Always
satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead by his constitutional activities,
he gradually gave up all material desires.
PURPORT
Severe austerities in the practice of devotional service are of many
varieties. For example, in worshiping the Deity in the temple there are
certainly laborious activities. Çré-vigrahärädhana-nitya-nänä
çåìgära-tan-mandira-märjanädau **(1). One must decorate the Deity, cleanse
the temple, bring water from the Ganges and Yamunä, continue the routine
work, perform ärati many times, prepare first-class food for the Deity, prepare
dresses and so on. In this way, one must constantly be engaged in various
activities, and the hard labor involved is certainly an austerity. Similarly, the
hard labor involved in preaching, preparing literature, preaching to atheistic
men and distributing literature door to door is of course an austerity
(tapo-yuktena). Tapo divyaà putrakä [SB 5.5.1]. Such austerity is necessary.

132
Yena sattvaà çuddhyet. By such austerity in devotional service, one is purified
of material existence (kämän çanair jahau). Indeed, such austerity leads one to
the constitutional position of devotional service. In this way one can give up
material desires, and as soon as one is freed from material desires, he is free
from the repetition of birth and death, old age and disease.

chariots, carts, horses and inexhaustible jewels, and to ornaments, garments and
an inexhaustible treasury. He gave up attachment to all of them, regarding them
as temporary and material.
PURPORT
Anäsaktasya viñayän yathärham upayuïjataù. Material possessions can be
accepted as far as they can be used in devotional service. Änukülyena
kåñëänuçélanam [Cc. Madhya 19.167]. Änukülyasya saìkalpaù prätikülyasya
varjanam. In preaching, many things considered material are needed. A
devotee should not have any attachment for such material involvements as
house, wife, children, friends and cars. Mahäräja Ambaréña, for example, had
all such things, but he was not attached to them. This is the effect of
bhakti-yoga. Bhaktiù pareçänubhavo viraktir anyatra ca (SB 11.2.42). One who is
advanced in devotional service has no attachment for material things for sense
enjoyment, but for preaching, to spread the glories of the Lord, he accepts such
things without attachment. Anäsaktasya viñayän yathärham upayuïjataù.
Everything can be used to the extent that it can be engaged in Kåñëa's service.

TRANSLATION
Being very pleased by the unalloyed devotion of Mahäräja Ambaréña, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead gave the King His disc, which is fearful to
enemies and which always protects the devotee from enemies and adversities.
PURPORT
A devotee, being always engaged in the service of the Lord, may not be
expert in self-defense, but because a devotee fully depends on the lotus feet of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is always sure of protection by the
Lord. Prahläda Mahäräja said:
naivodvije para duratyaya-vaitaraëyäs
tvad-vérya-gäyana-mahämåta-magna-cittaù
(SB 7.9.43)
A devotee is always merged in the ocean of the transcendental bliss of
rendering service to the Lord. Therefore he is not at all afraid of any adverse
situation in the material world. The Lord also promises, kaunteya pratijänéhi na
me bhaktaù praëaçyati: "O Arjuna, you may declare to the world that the
devotees of the Lord are never vanquished." (Bg. 9.31) For the protection of
the devotees, Kåñëa's disc, the Sudarçana cakra, is always ready. This disc is
extremely fearful to the nondevotees (pratyanéka-bhayävaham). Therefore
although Mahäräja Ambaréña was fully engaged in devotional service, his
kingdom was free of all fear of adversity.

PURPORT
To observe Ekädaçé-vrata and Dvädaçé-vrata means to please the Supreme

must observe Ekädaçé-vrata regularly. Mahäräja Ambaréña's queen was equally
as qualified as the King. Therefore it was possible for Mahäräja Ambaréña to
engage his life in household affairs. In this regard, the word tulya-çélayä is very
significant. Unless a wife is equally as qualified as her husband, household

affairs are very difficult to continue. Cäëakya Paëòita advises that a person in
such a situation should immediately give up household life and become a
vänaprastha or sannyäsé:

araëyaà tena gantavyaà

A person who has no mother at home and whose wife is not agreeable with
him should immediately go away to the forest. Because human life is meant for
spiritual advancement only, one's wife must be helpful in this endeavor.
Otherwise there is no need of household life.

Thereafter, Mahäräja Ambaréña satisfied all the guests who arrived at his

plate. All the cows were well decorated with garments and had full milk bags.
They were mild-natured, young and beautiful and were accompanied by their
calves. After giving these cows, the King first sumptuously fed all the
brähmaëas, and when they were fully satisfied, he was about to observe the end
of Ekädaçé, with their permission, by breaking the fast. Exactly at that time,
however, Durväsä Muni, the great and powerful mystic, appeared on the scene
as an uninvited guest.

The King said: "To transgress the laws of respectful behavior toward the
brähmaëas is certainly a great offense. On the other hand, if one does not
observe the breaking of the fast within the time of Dvädaçé, there is a flaw in
one's observance of the vow. Therefore, O brähmaëas, if you think that it will
be auspicious and not irreligious, I shall break the fast by drinking water." In
this way, after consulting with the brähmaëas, the King reached this decision,
for according to brahminical opinion, drinking water may be accepted as eating
and also as not eating.

When Mahäräja Ambaréña, in his dilemma, consulted the brähmaëas about
whether he should break the fast or wait for Durväsä Muni, apparently they
could not give a definite answer about what to do. A Vaiñëava, however, is the
most intelligent personality. Therefore Mahäräja Ambaréña himself decided, in
the presence of the brähmaëas, that he would drink a little water, for this
would confirm that the fast was broken but would not transgress the laws for
receiving a brähmaëa. In the Vedas it is said, apo 'çnäti tan naiväçitaà
naivänaçitam. This Vedic injunction declares that the drinking of water may
be accepted as eating or as not eating. Sometimes in our practical experience
we see that some political leader adhering to satyägraha will not eat but will
drink water. Considering that drinking water would not be eating, Mahäräja
Ambaréña decided to act in this way.

himself God. Just see how he has transgressed the laws of religion.
PURPORT
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has diverted the entire meaning of
this verse as spoken by Durväsä Muni. Durväsä Muni used the word
nå-çaàsasya to indicate that the King was cruel, but Viçvanätha Cakravarté
Öhäkura interprets it to mean that the King's character was glorified by all the
local people. He says that the word nå means "by all the local people" and that
çaàsasya means "of he (Ambaréña) whose character was glorified." Similarly,
one who is very rich becomes mad because of his wealth and is therefore called
çriyä-unmattasya, but Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura interprets these
words to mean that although Mahäräja Ambaréña was such an opulent king, he
was not mad after money, for he had already surpassed the madness of material
opulence. Similarly, the word éça-mäninaù is interpreted to mean that he was
so respectful to the Supreme Personality of Godhead that he did not transgress
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
148
the laws for observing Ekädaçé-päraëa, despite the thinking of Durväsä Muni,
for he only took water. In this way, Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura has
supported Ambaréña Mahäräja and all his activities.

As fire in the forest immediately burns to ashes an angry snake, so, by the
previous order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, His disc, the Sudarçana
cakra, immediately burnt to ashes the created demon to protect the Lord's
devotee.
PURPORT
As a pure devotee, Mahäräja Ambaréña, although in such danger, did not
move an inch from his position, nor did he request the Supreme Personality of
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
152
Godhead to give him protection. He was fixed in understanding, and it was
certain that he was simply thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in
the core of his heart. A devotee is never fearful of his death, for he meditates
on the Supreme Personality of Godhead always, not for any material profit,
but as his duty. The Lord, however, knows how to protect His devotee. As
indicated by the words präg diñöam, the Lord knew everything. Therefore,
before anything happened, He had already arranged for His cakra to protect
Mahäräja Ambaréña. This protection is offered to a devotee even from the very
beginning of his devotional service. Kaunteya pratijänéhi na me bhaktaù
praëaçyati (Bg. 9.31). If one simply begins devotional service, he is immediately
protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also confirmed in
Bhagavad-gétä (18.66): ahaà tväà sarva-päpebhyo mokñayiñyämi. Protection
begins immediately. The Lord is so kind and merciful that He gives the
devotee proper guidance and all protection, and thus the devotee very
peacefully makes solid progress in Kåñëa consciousness without outward
disturbances. A serpent may be very angry and ready to bite, but the furious
snake is helpless when faced by a blazing fire in the forest. Although an enemy
of a devotee may be very strong, he is compared to an angry serpent before the
fire of devotional service.

Lord Brahmä said: At the end of the dvi-parärdha, when the pastimes of the
Lord come to an end, Lord Viñëu, by a flick of His eyebrows, vanquishes the
entire universe, including our places of residence. Such personalities as me and
Lord Çiva, as well as Dakña, Bhågu and similar great saints of which they are
the head, and also the rulers of the living entities, the rulers of human society
and the rulers of the demigods—all of us surrender to that Supreme Personality
of Godhead, Lord Viñëu, bowing our heads, to carry out His orders for the
benefit of all living entities.

In Bhagavad-gétä (10.34) it is said, måtyuù sarva-haraç cäham: when the
Supreme Personality of Godhead approaches as death, or the supreme
controller of time, He takes everything away. In other words, all opulence,
prestige and everything we possess is given by the Supreme Lord for some
purpose. It is the duty of the surrendered soul to execute the orders of the
Supreme. No one can disregard Him. Under the circumstances, Lord Brahmä
refused to give shelter to Durväsä Muni from the powerful Sudarçana cakra
sent by the Lord.

devotee's devotee (the devotee's devotee is extremely dear to Me).
TRANSLATION
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said to the brähmaëa: I am completely
under the control of My devotees. Indeed, I am not at all independent. Because
My devotees are completely devoid of material desires, I sit only within the
cores of their hearts. What to speak of My devotee, even those who are devotees
of My devotee are very dear to Me.
PURPORT
All the great stalwart personalities in the universe, including Lord Brahmä
and Lord Çiva, are fully under the control of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead is fully under the control
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
166
of His devotee. Why is this? Because the devotee is anyäbhiläñitä-çünya; in
other words, he has no material desires in his heart. His only desire is to think
always of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and how to serve Him best.
Because of this transcendental qualification, the Supreme Lord is extremely
favorable to the devotees—indeed, not only the devotees, but also the
devotees of the devotees. Çréla Narottama däsa Öhäkura says, chäòiyä
vaiñëava-sevä nistära päyeche kebä: without being a devotee of a devotee, one
cannot be released from material entanglement. Therefore Caitanya
Mahäprabhu identified Himself as gopé-bhartuù pada-kamalayor
däsa-däsänudäsaù [Cc. Madhya 13.80]. Thus he instructed us to become not
directly servants of Kåñëa but servants of the servant of Kåñëa. Devotees like
Brahmä, Närada, Vyäsadeva and Çukadeva Gosvämé are directly servants of
Kåñëa, and one who becomes a servant of Närada, Vyäsadeva and Çukadeva,
like the six Gosvämés, is still more devoted. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté
Öhäkura therefore says, yasya prasädäd bhagavat-prasädaù: **(2) if one very
sincerely serves the spiritual master, Kåñëa certainly becomes favorable to such
a devotee. Following the instructions of a devotee is more valuable than
following the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly.

TRANSLATION
O best of the brähmaëas, without saintly persons for whom I am the only
destination, I do not desire to enjoy My transcendental bliss and My supreme
opulences.
PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is self-sufficient, but to enjoy His
transcendental bliss He requires the cooperation of His devotees. In
Våndävana, for example, although Lord Kåñëa is full in Himself, He wants the
cooperation of His devotees like the cowherd boys and the gopés to increase
His transcendental bliss. Such pure devotees, who can increase the pleasure
potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are certainly most dear to
Him. Not only does the Supreme Personality of Godhead enjoy the company
of His devotees, but because He is unlimited He wants to increase His devotees
unlimitedly. Thus, He descends to the material world to induce the
nondevotees and rebellious living entities to return home, back to Godhead.
He requests them to surrender unto Him because, unlimited as He is, He wants
to increase His devotees unlimitedly. The Kåñëa consciousness movement is an
attempt to increase the number of pure devotees of the Supreme Lord more
and more. It is certain that a devotee who helps in this endeavor to satisfy the
Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes indirectly a controller of the
Supreme Lord. Although the Supreme Lord is full in six opulences, He does
not feel transcendental bliss without His devotees. An example that may be
cited in this regard is that if a very rich man does not have sons in a family he
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
168
does not feel happiness. Indeed, sometimes a rich man adopts a son to complete
his happiness. The science of transcendental bliss is known to the pure
devotee. Therefore the pure devotee is always engaged in increasing the
transcendental happiness of the Lord.

improvement in this life or in the next, how can I give up such devotees at any
time?

169
PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped by the words
brahmaëya-deväya go-brähmaëa-hitäya ca. Thus He is the well-wisher of the
brähmaëas. Durväsä Muni was certainly a very great brähmaëa, but because he
was a nondevotee, he could not sacrifice everything in devotional service.
Great mystic yogés are actually self-interested. The proof is that when Durväsä
Muni created a demon to kill Mahäräja Ambaréña, the King stayed fixed in his
place, praying to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and depending solely
and wholly on Him, whereas when Durväsä Muni was chased by the Sudarçana
cakra by the supreme will of the Lord, he was so perturbed that he fled all over
the world and tried to take shelter in every nook and corner of the universe.
At last, in fear of his life, he approached Lord Brahmä, Lord Çiva and
ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He was so interested in his
own body that he wanted to kill the body of a Vaiñëava. Therefore, he did not
have very good intelligence, and how can an unintelligent person be delivered
by the Supreme Personality of Godhead? The Lord certainly tries to give all
protection to His devotees who have given up everything for the sake of
serving Him.
Another point in this verse is that attachment to
därägära-puträpta—home, wife, children, friendship, society and love—is not
the way to achieve the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who
is attached to hearth and home for material pleasure cannot become a pure
devotee. Sometimes a pure devotee may have a habit or attraction for wife,
children and home but at the same time want to serve the Supreme Lord to the
best of his ability. For such a devotee, the Lord makes a special arrangement to
take away the objects of his false attachment and thus free him from
attachment to wife, home, children, friends and so on. This is special mercy
bestowed upon the devotee to bring him back home, back to Godhead.

As chaste women bring their gentle husbands under control by service, the
pure devotees, who are equal to everyone and completely attached to Me in the
core of the heart, bring Me under their full control.
PURPORT
In this verse, the word sama-darçanäù is significant. The pure devotee is
actually equal toward everyone, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä (18.54):
brahma-bhütaù prasannätmä na çocati na käìkñati/ samaù sarveñu bhüteñu.
Universal brotherhood is possible when one is a pure devotee (paëòitäù
sama-darçinaù [Bg. 5.18]). A pure devotee is actually learned because he knows
his constitutional position, he knows the position of the Supreme Personality
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
171
of Godhead, and he knows the relationship between the living entity and the
Supreme Lord. Thus he has full spiritual knowledge and is automatically
liberated (brahma-bhütaù). He can therefore see everyone on the spiritual
platform. He can comprehend the happiness and distress of all living entities.
He understands that what is happiness to him is also happiness to others and
that what is distress to him is distressing for others. Therefore he is
sympathetic to everyone. As Prahläda Mahäräja said:
çoce tato vimukha-cetasa indriyärthamäyä-
sukhäya bharam udvahato vimüòhän
(SB 7.9.43)
People suffer from material distress because they are not attached to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. A pure devotee's chief concern, therefore, is
to raise the ignorant mass of people to the sense of Kåñëa consciousness.

Çréla Bilvamaìgala Öhäkura has estimated the value of liberation as follows:

Bilvamaìgala Öhäkura realized that if one develops his natural devotional
service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, mukti stands before him with
folded hands to offer all kinds of service. In other words, the devotee is already
liberated. There is no need for him to aspire for different types of liberation.
The pure devotee automatically achieves liberation, even without desiring it.

Personality of Godhead, for the Lord says, sädhavo hådayaà mahyam: "The
pure devotee is always within the core of My heart." The Lord's feelings are
like those of a father, who feels pain when his child is in pain. Therefore,
offenses at the lotus feet of a devotee are serious. Caitanya Mahäprabhu has
very strongly recommended that one not commit any offense at the lotus feet
of a devotee. Such offenses are compared to a mad elephant because when a
mad elephant enters a garden it causes devastation. Therefore one should be
extremely careful not to commit offenses at the lotus feet of a pure devotee.
Actually Mahäräja Ambaréña was not at all at fault; Durväsä Muni
unnecessarily wanted to chastise him on flimsy grounds. Mahäräja Ambaréña
wanted to complete the Ekädaçé-päraëa as part of devotional service to please

174
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore he drank a little water.
But although Durväsä Muni was a great mystic brähmaëa, he did not know
what is what. That is the difference between a pure devotee and a so-called
learned scholar of Vedic knowledge. The devotees, being always situated in the
core of the Lord's heart, surely get all instructions directly from the Lord, as
confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gétä (10.11):
teñäm evänukampärtham
aham ajïäna-jaà tamaù
näçayämy ätma-bhävastho
jïäna-dépena bhäsvatä
"Out of compassion for them, I, dwelling in their hearts, destroy with the
shining lamp of knowledge the darkness born of ignorance." The devotee does
not do anything not sanctioned by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As it
is said, vaiñëavera kriyä mudrä vijïeha nä bujhaya [Cc. Madhya 23.39]. Even the
most learned or experienced person cannot understand the movements of a
Vaiñëava, a pure devotee. No one, therefore, should criticize a pure Vaiñëava.
A Vaiñëava knows his own business; whatever he does is precisely right
because he is always guided by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
O brähmaëa, let Me now advise you for your own protection. Please hear
from Me. By offending Mahäräja Ambaréña, you have acted with self-envy.
Therefore you should go to him immediately, without a moment's delay. One's
so-called prowess, when employed against the devotee, certainly harms he who
employs it. Thus it is the subject, not the object, who is harmed.
PURPORT
A Vaiñëava is always an object of envy for nondevotees, even when the
nondevotee happens to be his father. To give a practical example,
Hiraëyakaçipu was envious of Prahläda Mahäräja, but this envy of the devotee
was harmful to Hiraëyakaçipu, not to Prahläda. Every action taken by
Hiraëyakaçipu against his son Prahläda Mahäräja was taken very seriously by
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus when Hiraëyakaçipu was on
the verge of killing Prahläda, the Lord personally appeared and killed

Hiraëyakaçipu. Service to a Vaiñëava gradually accumulates and becomes an
asset for the devotee. Similarly, harmful activities directed against the devotee
gradually become the ultimate cause of the performer's falldown. Even such a
great brähmaëa and mystic yogé as Durväsä was in a most dangerous situation
because of his offense at the lotus feet of Mahäräja Ambaréña, a pure devotee.

It is said that a jewel is very valuable, but when it is on the hood of a
serpent, it is dangerous despite its value. Similarly, when a materialistic
nondevotee achieves great success in learning and austerity, that success is
dangerous for all of society. So-called learned scientists, for example, invented
atomic weapons that are dangerous for all humanity. It is therefore said,
maëinä bhüñitaù sarpaù kim asau na bhayaìkaraù. A serpent with a jewel on its
hood is as dangerous as a serpent without such a jewel. Durväsä Muni was a
very learned brähmaëa equipped with mystic power, but because he was not a
gentleman, he did not know how to use his power. He was therefore extremely
dangerous. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is never inclined toward a
dangerous person who uses his mystic power for some personal design. By the
laws of nature, therefore, such misuse of power is ultimately dangerous not for
society but for the person who misuses it.

The lesson to be derived from this narration concerning Mahäräja Ambaréña
and Durväsä Muni is that all the demigods, including Lord Brahmä and Lord
Çiva, are under the control of Lord Viñëu. Therefore, when a Vaiñëava is
offended, the offender is punished by Viñëu, the Supreme Lord. No one can
protect such a person, even Lord Brahmä or Lord Çiva.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Fourth Chapter, of the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Ambaréña Mahäräja Offended by Durväsä Muni."
5. Durväsä Muni's Life Spared
In this chapter we find Mahäräja Ambaréña offering prayers to the
Sudarçana cakra and we find how the Sudarçana cakra became merciful to
Durväsä Muni.
By the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu, Durväsä Muni
immediately went to Mahäräja Ambaréña and fell at his lotus feet. Mahäräja
Ambaréña, being naturally very humble and meek, felt shy and ashamed
because Durväsä Muni had fallen at his feet, and thus he began to offer prayers
to the Sudarçana cakra just to save Durväsä. What is this Sudarçana cakra?
The Sudarçana cakra is the glance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by
which He creates the entire material world. Sa aikñata, sa asåjata. This is the
Vedic version. The Sudarçana cakra, which is the origin of creation and is
most dear to the Lord, has thousands of spokes. This Sudarçana cakra is the
killer of the prowess of all other weapons, the killer of darkness, and the
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
180
manifester of the prowess of devotional service; it is the means of establishing
religious principles, and it is the killer of all irreligious activities. Without his
mercy, the universe cannot be maintained, and therefore the Sudarçana cakra
is employed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When Mahäräja
Ambaréña thus prayed that the Sudarçana cakra be merciful, the Sudarçana
cakra, being appeased, refrained from killing Durväsä Muni, who thus achieved
the Sudarçana cakra's mercy. Durväsä Muni thus learned to give up the nasty
idea of considering a Vaiñëava an ordinary person (vaiñëave jäti-buddhi).
Mahäräja Ambaréña belonged to the kñatriya group, and therefore Durväsä
Muni considered him lower than the brähmaëas and wanted to exercise
brahminical power against him. By this incident, everyone should learn how to
stop mischievous ideas of neglecting Vaiñëavas. After this incident, Mahäräja
Ambaréña gave Durväsä Muni sumptuous food to eat, and then the King, who
had been standing in the same place for one year without eating anything, also
took prasäda. Mahäräja Ambaréña later divided his property among his sons
and went to the bank of the Mänasa-sarovara to execute devotional
meditation.

PURPORT
The word sudarçana means "auspicious vision." From Vedic instructions we
understand that this material world is created by the glance of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead (sa aikñata, sa asåjata). The Supreme Personality of
Godhead glanced over the mahat-tattva, or the total material energy, and when
it was agitated, everything came into existence. Western philosophers
sometimes think that the original cause of creation was a chunk that exploded.
If one thinks of this chunk as the total material energy, the mahat-tattva, one
can understand that the chunk was agitated by the glance of the Lord, and
thus the Lord's glance is the original cause of material creation.

PURPORT
The disc of the Lord is called Sudarçana because he does not discriminate
between high and low criminals or demons. Durväsä Muni was certainly a
powerful brähmaëa, but his acts against the pure devotee Mahäräja Ambaréña
were no better than the activities of asuras. As stated in the çästras, dharmaà
tu säkñäd bhagavat-praëétam: [SB 6.3.19] the word dharma refers to the orders
or laws given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sarva-dharmän
parityajya mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja: [Bg. 18.66] real dharma is surrender unto
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore real dharma means bhakti, or
devotional service to the Lord. The Sudarçana cakra is here addressed as
dharma-setave, the protector of dharma. Mahäräja Ambaréña was a truly
religious person, and consequently for his protection the Sudarçana cakra was
ready to punish even such a strict brähmaëa as Durväsä Muni because he had
acted like a demon. There are demons even in the form of brähmaëas.
Therefore the Sudarçana cakra does not discriminate between brähmaëa
demons and çüdra demons. Anyone against the Supreme Personality of
Godhead and His devotees is called a demon. In the çästras we find many
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
187
brähmaëas and kñatriyas who acted as demons and have been described as
demons. According to the verdict of the çästras, one has to be understood
according to his symptoms. If one is born of a brähmaëa father but his
symptoms are demoniac, he is regarded as a demon. The Sudarçana cakra is
always concerned with annihilating the demons. Therefore he is described as
adharma-çéläsura-dhüma-ketave. Those who are not devotees are called
adharma-çéla. The Sudarçana cakra is just like an inauspicious comet for all
such demons.

O master of speech, by your effulgence, full of religious principles, the
darkness of the world is dissipated, and the knowledge of learned persons or
great souls is manifested. Indeed, no one can surpass your effulgence, for all
things, manifested and unmanifested, gross and subtle, superior and inferior, are
but various forms of you that are manifested by your effulgence.
PURPORT
Without illumination, nothing can be seen, especially in this material
world. The illumination in this world emanates from the effulgence of
Sudarçana, the original vision of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The
illuminating principles of the sun, the moon and fire emanate from Sudarçana.
Similarly, illumination by knowledge also comes from Sudarçana because with
the illumination of Sudarçana one can distinguish one thing from another, the
superior from the inferior. Generally people accept a powerful yogi like
Durväsä Muni as wonderfully superior, but if such a person is chased by the
Sudarçana cakra, we can see his real identity and understand how inferior he is
because of his dealings with devotees.

Durväsä Muni said: I am very pleased with you, my dear King. At first I
thought of you as an ordinary human being and accepted your hospitality, but
later I could understand, by my own intelligence, that you are the most exalted
devotee of the Lord. Therefore, simply by seeing you, touching your feet and
talking with you, I have been pleased and have become obliged to you.
PURPORT
It is said, vaiñëavera kriyä mudrä vijïeha nä bujhaya: [Cc. Madhya 23.39]
even a very intelligent man cannot understand the activities of a pure
Vaiñëava. Therefore, because Durväsä Muni was a great mystic yogé, he first
mistook Mahäräja Ambaréña for an ordinary human being and wanted to
punish him. Such is the mistaken observation of a Vaiñëava. When Durväsä
Muni was persecuted by the Sudarçana cakra, however, his intelligence
developed. Therefore the word ätma-medhasä is used to indicate that by his
personal experience he would understand how great a Vaiñëava the King was.
When Durväsä Muni was chased by the Sudarçana cakra, he wanted to take
shelter of Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva, and he was even able to go to the
spiritual world, meet the Personality of Godhead and talk with Him face to
face, yet he was unable to be rescued from the attack of the Sudarçana cakra.
Thus he could understand the influence of a Vaiñëava by personal experience.
Durväsä Muni was certainly a great yogé and a very learned brähmaëa, but
despite his being a real yogé he was unable to understand the influence of a
Vaiñëava. Therefore it is said, vaiñëavera kriyä mudrä vijïeha nä bujhaya: even
the most learned person cannot understand the value of a Vaiñëava. There is
always a possibility for so-called jïänés and yogés to be mistaken when studying
the character of a Vaiñëava. A Vaiñëava can be understood by how much he is
favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in terms of his inconceivable
activities.

Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé continued: Thus being satisfied in all respects, the
great mystic yogé Durväsä took permission and left, continuously glorifying the
King. Through the skyways, he went to Brahmaloka, which is devoid of
agnostics and dry philosophical speculators.
PURPORT
Although Durväsä Muni went back to Brahmaloka through the spaceways,
he did not need an airplane, for great mystic yogés can transport themselves
from any planet to any other without any machine. There is a planet named
Siddhaloka whose inhabitants can go to any other planet because they
naturally have all the perfection of yoga practice. Thus Durväsä Muni, the
great mystic yogé, could go through the skyways to any planet, even to
Brahmaloka. In Brahmaloka, everyone is self-realized, and thus there is no
need of philosophical speculation to come to the conclusion of the Absolute

202
Truth. Durväsä Muni's purpose in going to Brahmaloka was apparently to
speak to the residents of Brahmaloka about how powerful a devotee is and how
a devotee can surpass every living entity within this material world. The
so-called jïänés and yogés cannot compare to a devotee.

After one year, when Durväsä Muni had returned, King Ambaréña
sumptuously fed him all varieties of pure food, and then he himself also ate.
When the King saw that the brähmaëa Durväsä had been released from the
great danger of being burned, he could understand that by the grace of the Lord
he himself was also powerful, but he did not take any credit, for everything had
been done by the Lord.

PURPORT
A devotee like Mahäräja Ambaréña is certainly always busy in many
activities. Of course, this material world is full of dangers that one has to meet,
but a devotee, because of his full dependence on the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, is never disturbed. The vivid example is Mahäräja Ambaréña. He was
the emperor of the entire world and had many duties to perform, and in the
course of these duties there were many disturbances created by persons like
Durväsä Muni, but the King tolerated everything, patiently depending fully on
the mercy of the Lord. The Lord, however, is situated in everyone's heart
(sarvasya cähaà hådi sanniviñöaù [Bg. 15.15]), and He manages things as He
desires. Thus although Mahäräja Ambaréña was faced with many disturbances,
the Lord, being merciful to him, managed things so nicely that in the end
Durväsä Muni and Mahäräja Ambaréña became great friends and parted
cordially on the basis of bhakti-yoga. After all, Durväsä Muni was convinced of
the power of bhakti-yoga, although he himself was a great mystic yogé.
Therefore, as stated by Lord Kåñëa in Bhagavad-gétä (6.47):
yoginäm api sarveñäà
mad-gatenäntarätmanä
çraddhävän bhajate yo mäà
sa me yuktatamo mataù
"Of all yogés, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in
transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is
the highest of all." Thus it is a fact that a devotee is the topmost yogé, as proved
in the dealings of Mahäräja Ambaréña with Durväsä Muni.

TRANSLATION
In this way, because of devotional service, Mahäräja Ambaréña, who was
endowed with varieties of transcendental qualities, was completely aware of
Brahman, Paramätmä and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus he
executed devotional service perfectly. Because of his devotion, he thought even
the topmost planet of this material world no better than the hellish planets.
PURPORT
An exalted and pure devotee like Mahäräja Ambaréña is in full awareness of
Brahman, Paramätmä and Bhagavän; in other words, a devotee of Väsudeva,
Kåñëa, is in full knowledge of the other features of the Absolute Truth. The
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
206
Absolute Truth is realized in three features—Brahman, Paramätmä and
Bhagavän (brahmeti paramätmeti bhagavän iti çabdyate [SB 1.2.11]). A devotee
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Väsudeva, knows everything
(väsudevaù sarvam iti [Bg. 7.19]) because Väsudeva, Kåñëa, includes both
Paramätmä and Brahman. One does not have to realize Paramätmä by the yoga
system, for the devotee always thinking of Väsudeva is the topmost yogé
(yoginäm api sarveñäm [Bg. 6.47]). And as far as jïäna is concerned, if one is a
perfect devotee of Väsudeva, he is the greatest mahätmä (väsudevaù sarvam iti
sa mahätmä sudurlabhaù). A mahätmä is one who has full knowledge of the
Absolute Truth. Thus Mahäräja Ambaréña, being a devotee of the Personality
of Godhead, was in full awareness of Paramätmä, Brahman, mäyä, the material
world, the spiritual world, and how things are going on everywhere.
Everything was known to him. Yasmin vijïäte sarvam evaà vijïätaà bhavati
(Muëòaka Upaniñad 1.3). Because the devotee knows Väsudeva, he knows
everything within the creation of Väsudeva (väsudevaù sarvam iti sa mahätmä
sudurlabhaù). Such a devotee does not give much value to the highest standard
of happiness within this material world.
näräyaëa-paräù sarve
na kutaçcana bibhyati
svargäpavarga-narakeñv
api tulyärtha-darçinaù
(SB 6.17.28)
Because he is fixed in devotional service, a devotee does not regard any
position in the material world as important. Çréla Prabodhänanda Sarasvaté has
therefore written (Caitanya-candrämåta 5):
kaivalyaà narakäyate tri-daça-pür äkäça-puñpäyate
durdäntendriya-käla-sarpa-paöalé protkhäta-daàñöräyate

207
For one who becomes a pure devotee through devotional service to great
personalities like Caitanya Mahäprabhu, kaivalya, or merging into Brahman,
appears no better than hell. As far as the heavenly planets are concerned, to a
devotee they are like a phantasmagoria or will-o'-the-wisp, and as far as yogic
perfection is concerned, a devotee does not care a fig for such perfection, since
the purpose of yogic perfection is achieved automatically by the devotee. This
is all possible when one becomes a devotee of the Lord through the medium of
Caitanya Mahäprabhu's instructions.

TRANSLATION
Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé continued: Thereafter, because of his advanced
position in devotional life, Mahäräja Ambaréña, who no longer desired to live
with material things, retired from active family life. He divided his property
among his sons, who were equally as qualified, and he himself took the order of
vänaprastha and went to the forest to concentrate his mind fully upon Lord
Väsudeva.
PURPORT
As a pure devotee, Mahäräja Ambaréña was liberated in any condition of
life because, as enunciated by Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé, a devotee is always
liberated.

In Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu, Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé thus instructs that if one's only
desire is service to the Lord, he is liberated in any condition of life. Mahäräja
Ambaréña was undoubtedly liberated in any condition, but as an ideal king he
accepted the vänaprastha order of retirement from family life. It is essential for
one to renounce family responsibilities and fully concentrate on the lotus feet
of Väsudeva. Therefore Mahäräja Ambaréña divided the kingdom among his
sons and retired from family life.

TRANSLATION
Anyone who chants this narration or even thinks of this narration about the
activities of Mahäräja Ambaréña certainly becomes a pure devotee of the Lord.
PURPORT
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura herein gives a very good example.
When one is very eager for more and more money, he is not satisfied even
when he is a millionaire or a multimillionaire, but wants to earn more and
more money by any means. The same mentality is present in a devotee. The
devotee is never satisfied, thinking, "This is the limit of my devotional service."
The more he engages in the service of the Lord, the more service he wants to
give. This is the position of a devotee. Mahäräja Ambaréña, in his family life,
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
210
was certainly a pure devotee, complete in every respect, because his mind and
all his senses were engaged in devotional service (sa vai manaù
kåñëa-padäravindayor vacäàsi vaikuëöha-guëänuvarëane [SB 9.4.18]). Mahäräja
Ambaréña was self-satisfied because all of his senses were engaged in devotional
service (sarvopädhi-vinirmuktaà tat-paratvena nirmalam/ håñékeëa
håñékeça-sevanaà bhaktir ucyate [Cc. Madhya 19.170]). Nonetheless, although
Mahäräja Ambaréña had engaged all his senses in devotional service, he left his
home and went to the forest to concentrate his mind fully at the lotus feet of
Kåñëa, exactly as a mercantile man, even though complete in wealth, tries to
earn more and more. This mentality of getting more and more engaged in
devotional service puts one in the most exalted position. Whereas on the
karma platform the mercantile man who wants more and more money becomes
increasingly bound and entangled, the devotee becomes increasingly liberated.

By the grace of the Lord, those who hear about the activities of Mahäräja
Ambaréña, the great devotee, certainly become liberated or become devotees
without delay.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Fifth Chapter, of the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Durväsä Muni's Life Spared."
6. The Downfall of Saubhari Muni
After describing the descendants of Mahäräja Ambaréña, Çukadeva
Gosvämé described all the kings from Çaçäda to Mändhätä, and in this
connection he also described how the great sage Saubhari married the
daughters of Mändhätä.
Mahäräja Ambaréña had three sons, named Virüpa, Ketumän and Çambhu.
The son of Virüpa was Påñadaçva, and his son was Rathétara. Rathétara had no
sons, but when he requested the favor of the great sage Aìgirä, the sage begot
several sons in the womb of Rathétara's wife. When the sons were born, they
became the dynasty of Aìgirä Åñi and of Rathétara.
The son of Manu was Ikñväku, who had one hundred sons, of whom
Vikukñi, Nimi and Daëòakä were the eldest. The sons of Mahäräja Ikñväku
became kings of different parts of the world. Because of violating sacrificial
rules and regulations, one of these sons, Vikukñi, was banished from the
kingdom. By the mercy of Vasiñöha and the power of mystic yoga, Mahäräja
Ikñväku attained liberation after giving up his material body. When Mahäräja
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
212
Ikñväku expired, his son Vikukñi returned and took charge of the kingdom. He
performed various types of sacrifices, and thus he pleased the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. This Vikukñi later became celebrated as Saçäda.
Vikukñi's son fought with the demons for the sake of the demigods, and
because of his valuable service he became famous as Puraïjaya, Indraväha and
Kakutstha. The son of Puraïjaya was Anenä, the son of Anenä was Påthu, and
the son of Påthu was Viçvagandhi. The son of Viçvagandhi was Candra, the
son of Candra was Yuvanäçva, and his son was Çrävasta, who constructed
Çrävasté Puré. The son of Çrävasta was Båhadaçva. Båhadaçva's son Kuvalayäçva
killed a demon named Dhundhu, and thus he became celebrated as
Dhundhumära, "the killer of Dhundhu." The sons of the killer of Dhundhu
were Dåòhäçva, Kapiläçva and Bhadräçva. He also had thousands of other sons,
but they burned to ashes in the fire emanating from Dhundhu. The son of
Dåòhäçva was Haryaçva, the son of Haryaçva was Nikumbha, the son of
Nikumbha was Bahuläçva, and the son of Bahuläçva was Kåçäçva. The son of
Kåçäçva was Senajit, and his son was Yuvanäçva.
Yuvanäçva married one hundred wives, but he had no sons, and therefore
he entered the forest. In the forest, the sages performed a sacrifice known as
Indra-yajïa on his behalf. Once, however, the King became so thirsty in the
forest that he drank the water kept for performing yajïa. Consequently, after
some time, a son came forth from the right side of his abdomen. The son, who
was very beautiful, was crying to drink breast milk, and Indra gave the child
his index finger to suck. Thus the son became known as Mändhätä. In due
course of time, Yuvanäçva achieved perfection by performing austerities.
Thereafter, Mändhätä became the emperor and ruled the earth, which
consists of seven islands. Thieves and rogues were very much afraid of this
powerful king, and therefore the king was known as Trasaddasyu, meaning
"one who is very fearful to rogues and thieves." Mändhätä begot sons in the
womb of his wife, Bindumaté. These sons were Purukutsa, Ambaréña and
Mucukunda. These three sons had fifty sisters, all of whom became wives of
the great sage known as Saubhari.

213
In this connection, Çukadeva Gosvämé described the history of Saubhari
Muni, who, because of sensual agitation caused by fish, fell from his yoga and
wanted to marry all the daughters of Mändhätä for sexual pleasure. Later,
Saubhari Muni became very regretful. Thus he accepted the order of
vänaprastha, performed very severe austerities, and thus attained perfection. In
this regard, Çukadeva Gosvämé described how Saubhari Muni's wives also
became perfect.

TRANSLATION
Rathétara had no sons, and therefore he requested the great sage Aìgirä to
beget sons for him. Because of this request, Aìgirä begot sons in the womb of
Rathétara's wife. All these sons were born with brahminical prowess.
PURPORT
In the Vedic age a man was sometimes called upon to beget sons in the
womb of a lesser man's wife for the sake of better progeny. In such an instance,
the woman is compared to an agricultural field. A person possessing an
agricultural field may employ another person to produce food grains from it,
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
215
but because the grains are produced from the land, they are considered the
property of the owner of the land. Similarly, a woman was sometimes allowed
to be impregnated by someone other than her husband, but the sons born of
her would then become her husband's sons. Such sons were called kñetra jäta.
Because Rathétara had no sons, he took advantage of this method.

According to Çrédhara Svämé, although the Bhägavatam (9.1.11-12) has

TRANSLATION
Thereafter, Ikñväku's son Vikukñi went to the forest and killed many
animals suitable for being offered as oblations. But when fatigued and hungry
he became forgetful and ate a rabbit he had killed.
PURPORT
It is evident that kñatriyas killed animals in the forest because the flesh of
the animals was suitable to be offered at a particular type of yajïa. Offering
oblations to the forefathers in the ceremony known as çräddha is also a kind of
yajïa. In this yajïa, flesh obtained from the forest by hunting could be offered.
However, in the present age, Kali-yuga, this kind of offering is forbidden.
Quoting from the Brahma-vaivarta Puräëa, Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu said:

220
açvamedhaà gavälambhaà
sannyäsaà pala-paitåkam
devareëa sutotpattià

[Cc. Ädi 17.164]
"In this age of Kali, five acts are forbidden: the offering of a horse in sacrifice,
the offering of a cow in sacrifice, the acceptance of the order of sannyäsa, the
offering of oblations of flesh to the forefathers, and a man's begetting children
in his brother's wife." The word pala-paitåkam refers to an offering of flesh in
oblations to forefathers. Formerly, such an offering was allowed, but in this age
it is forbidden. In this age, Kali-yuga, everyone is expert in hunting animals,
but most of the people are çüdras, not kñatriyas. According to Vedic
injunctions, however, only kñatriyas are allowed to hunt, whereas çüdras are
allowed to eat flesh after offering goats or other insignificant animals before
the deity of goddess Kälé or similar demigods. On the whole, meat-eating is not
completely forbidden; a particular class of men is allowed to eat meat
according to various circumstances and injunctions. As far as eating beef is
concerned, however, it is strictly prohibited to everyone. Thus in
Bhagavad-gétä Kåñëa personally speaks of go-rakñyam, cow protection.
Meat-eaters, according to their different positions and the directions of the
çästra, are allowed to eat flesh, but never the flesh of cows. Cows must be given
all protection.

Vikukñi offered the remnants of the flesh to King Ikñväku, who gave it to
Vasiñöha for purification. But Vasiñöha could immediately understand that part
of the flesh had already been taken by Vikukñi, and therefore he said that it was
unfit to be used in the çräddha ceremony.
PURPORT
That which is meant to be offered in yajïa cannot be tasted by anyone
before being offered to the Deity. In our temples, this regulation is in effect.
One cannot eat food from the kitchen unless it is offered to the Deity. If
something is taken before being offered to the Deity, the entire preparation is
polluted and can no longer be offered. Those engaged in Deity worship must
know this very well so that they may be saved from committing offenses in
Deity worship.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not different from the auspicious
aspects of great sacrifices, such as the ingredients of the sacrifice, the chanting
of Vedic hymns, the regulative principles, the performer, the priests, the result
of the sacrifice, the arena of sacrifice, and the time of sacrifice. Knowing the
principles of self-realization, Mändhätä worshiped that transcendentally situated
Supreme Soul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viñëu, who
comprises all the demigods. He also gave immense charity to the brähmaëas, and
thus he performed yajïa to worship the Lord.

husband according to her personal selection."

Saubhari Muni thought: I am now feeble because of old age. My hair has
become grey, my skin is slack, and my head always trembles. Besides, I am a
yogé. Therefore women do not like me. Since the King has thus rejected me, I
shall reform my body in such a way as to be desirable even to celestial women,
what to speak of the daughters of worldly kings.

vandiñu—and professional singers.
TRANSLATION
Because Saubhari Muni was expert in chanting mantras perfectly, his severe
austerities resulted in an opulent home, with garments, ornaments, properly
dressed and decorated maidservants and manservants, and varieties of parks
with clear-water lakes and gardens. In the gardens, fragrant with varieties of
flowers, birds chirped and bees hummed, surrounded by professional singers.
Saubhari Muni's home was amply provided with valuable beds, seats,
ornaments, and arrangements for bathing, and there were varieties of
sandalwood creams, flower garlands, and palatable dishes. Thus surrounded by
opulent paraphernalia, the muni engaged in family affairs with his numerous
wives.
PURPORT
Saubhari Åñi was a great yogé. Yogic perfection makes available eight
material opulences—aëimä, laghimä, mahimä, präpti, präkämya, éçitva, vaçitva
and kämävasäyitä. Saubhari Muni exhibited super-excellence in material
enjoyment by dint of his yogic perfection. The word bahv-åca means "expert in
chanting mantras." As material opulence can be achieved by ordinary material
means, it can also be achieved by subtle means through mantras. By chanting
mantras, Saubhari Muni arranged for material opulence, but this was not
perfection in life. As will be seen, Saubhari Muni became very dissatisfied with
material opulence and thus left everything and reentered the forest in the
vänaprastha order and achieved final success. Those who are not
ätma-tattva-vit, who do not know the spiritual value of life, can be satisfied
with external material opulences, but those who are ätma-tattva-vit are not
inspired by material opulence. This is the instruction we can derive from the
life and activities of Saubhari Muni.

In this way, Saubhari Muni enjoyed sense gratification in the material world,

PURPORT
Material desire is just like a blazing fire. If a fire is continually supplied with
drops of fat, the fire will increase more and more and never be extinguished.
Therefore the policy of trying to satisfy material desires by catering to one's
material demands will never be successful. In modern civilization, everyone is
engaged in economic development, which is another way of constantly
dropping fat into the material fire. The Western countries have reached the
summit of material civilization, but people are still dissatisfied. Real

satisfaction is Kåñëa consciousness. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä (5.29),
where Kåñëa says:
bhoktäraà yajïa-tapasäà
sarva-loka-maheçvaram

"The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities,
the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the benefactor and
well-wisher of all living entities, attains peace from the pangs of material
miseries." One must therefore take to Kåñëa consciousness and advance in
Kåñëa consciousness by properly following the regulative principles. Then one
can attain an eternal, blissful life in peace and knowledge.

Thereafter, one day while Saubhari Muni, who was expert in chanting
mantras, was sitting in a secluded place, he thought to himself about the cause
of his falldown, which was simply that he had associated himself with the sexual
affairs of the fish.
PURPORT
Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura remarks that Saubhari Muni had fallen
from his austerity because of a vaiñëava-aparädha. The history is that when
Garuòa wanted to eat fish, Saubhari Muni unnecessarily gave the fish shelter
under his care. Because Garuòa's plans for eating were disappointed, Saubhari
Muni certainly committed a great offense to a Vaiñëava. Because of this
vaiñëava-aparädha, an offense at the lotus feet of a Vaiñëava, Saubhari Muni
fell from his exalted position of mystic tapasya. One should not, therefore,
impede the activities of a Vaiñëava. This is the lesson we must learn from this
incident concerning Saubhari Muni.

TRANSLATION
A person desiring liberation from material bondage must give up the
association of persons interested in sex life and should not employ his senses
externally [in seeing, hearing, talking, walking and so on]. One should always
stay in a secluded place, completely fixing his mind at the lotus feet of the
unlimited Personality of Godhead, and if one wants any association at all, he
should associate with persons similarly engaged.
PURPORT
Saubhari Muni, giving conclusions derived from his practical experience,
instructs us that persons interested in crossing to the other side of the material
ocean must give up the association of persons interested in sex life and
accumulating money. This is also advised by Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu:
niñkiïcanasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukasya
päraà paraà jigamiñor bhava-sägarasya
sandarçanaà viñayiëäm atha yoñitäà ca
hä hanta hanta viña-bhakñaëato 'py asädhu
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
257
[Cc. Madhya 11.8]
(Caitanya-candrodaya-näöaka 8.27)
"Alas, for a person seriously desiring to cross the material ocean and engage in
the transcendental loving service of the Lord without material motives, seeing
a materialist engaged in sense gratification and seeing a woman who is
similarly interested is more abominable than drinking poison willingly."
One who desires complete freedom from material bondage can engage
himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. He must not associate
with viñayé—materialistic persons or those interested in sex life. Every
materialist is interested in sex. Thus in plain language it is advised that an
exalted saintly person avoid the association of those who are materially
inclined. Çréla Narottama däsa Öhäkura also recommends that one engage in
the service of the äcäryas, and if one wants to live in association, he must live
in the association of devotees (täìdera caraëa sevi bhakta-sane väsa). The
Kåñëa consciousness movement is creating many centers just to create
devotees so that by associating with the members of such a center people will
automatically become uninterested in material affairs. Although this is an
ambitious proposal, this association is proving effective by the mercy of Çré
Caitanya Mahäprabhu. By gradually associating with the members of the
Kåñëa consciousness movement, simply by taking prasäda and taking part in
chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mantra, ordinary persons are being considerably
elevated. Saubhari Muni regrets that he had bad association even in the
deepest part of the water. Because of the bad association of the sexually
engaged fish, he fell down. A secluded place is also not secure unless there is
good association.

In this way he passed his life in household affairs for some time, but then he
became detached from material enjoyment. To renounce material association, he
accepted the vänaprastha order and went to the forest. His devoted wives
followed him, for they had no shelter other than their husband.

SYNONYMS
tatra—in the forest; taptvä—executing austerity; tapaù—the regulative
principles of austerity; tékñëam—very severely; ätma-darçanam—which helps
self-realization; ätmavän—conversant with the self; saha—with;
eva—certainly; agnibhiù—fires; ätmänam—the personal self; yuyoja—he
engaged; parama-ätmani—dealing with the Supreme Soul.
TRANSLATION
When Saubhari Muni, who was quite conversant with the self, went to the
forest, he performed severe penances. In this way, in the fire at the time of
death, he ultimately engaged himself in the service of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead.
PURPORT
At the time of death, fire burns the gross body, and if there is no more
desire for material enjoyment the subtle body is also ended, and in this way a
pure soul remains. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä (tyaktvä dehaà punar
janma naiti [Bg. 4.9]). If one is free from the bondage of both the gross and
subtle material bodies and remains a pure soul, he returns home, back to
Godhead, to be engaged in the service of the Lord. Tyaktvä dehaà punar janma
naiti mäm eti: he goes back home, back to Godhead. Thus it appears that
Saubhari Muni attained that perfect stage.

could go to the spiritual world); agnim—the fire; çäntam—completely merged;

TRANSLATION
O Mahäräja Parékñit, by observing their husband progressing in spiritual
existence, Saubhari Muni's wives were also able to enter the spiritual world by
his spiritual power, just as the flames of a fire cease when the fire is
extinguished.
PURPORT
As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (9.32), striyo vaiçyäs tathä çüdräs te 'pi yänti
paräà gatim. Women are not considered very powerful in following spiritual
principles, but if a woman is fortunate enough to get a suitable husband who is
spiritually advanced and if she always engages in his service, she also gets the
same benefit as her husband. Here it is clearly said that the wives of Saubhari
Muni also entered the spiritual world by the influence of their husband. They
were unfit, but because they were faithful followers of their husband, they also

entered the spiritual world with him. Thus a woman should be a faithful
servant of her husband, and if the husband is spiritually advanced, the woman
will automatically get the opportunity to enter the spiritual world.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Sixth Chapter, of the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Downfall of Saubhari Muni."
7. The Descendants of King Mändhätä
In this chapter the descendants of King Mändhätä are described, and in
this connection the histories of Purukutsa and Hariçcandra are also given.
The most prominent son of Mändhätä was Ambaréña, his son was
Yauvanäçva, and Yauvanäçva's son was Häréta. These three personalities were
the best in the dynasty of Mändhätä. Purukutsa, another son of Mändhätä,
married the sister of the snakes (sarpa-gaëa) named Narmadä. The son of
Purukutsa was Trasaddasyu, whose son was Anaraëya. Anaraëya's son was
Haryaçva, Haryaçva's son was Präruëa, Präruëa's son was Tribandhana, and
Tribandhana's son was Satyavrata, also known as Triçaìku. When Triçaìku
kidnapped the daughter of a brähmaëa, his father cursed him for this sinful
act, and Triçaìku became a caëòäla, worse than a çüdra. Later, by the
influence of Viçvämitra, he was brought to the heavenly planets, but by the
influence of the demigods he fell back downward. He was stopped in his fall,
however, by the influence of Viçvämitra. The son of Triçaìku was
Hariçcandra. Hariçcandra once performed a Räjasüya-yajïa, but Viçvämitra
cunningly took all of Hariçcandra's possessions as a dakñiëa contribution and
chastised Hariçcandra in various ways. Because of this, a quarrel arose between
Viçvämitra and Vasiñöha. Hariçcandra had no sons, but on the advice of
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
263
Närada he worshiped Varuëa and in this way got a son named Rohita.
Hariçcandra promised that Rohita would be used to perform a Varuëa-yajïa.
Varuëa reminded Hariçcandra repeatedly about this yajïa, but the King,
because of affection for his son, gave various arguments to avoid sacrificing
him. Thus time passed, and gradually the son grew up. To safeguard his life, the
boy then took bow and arrows in hand and went to the forest. Meanwhile, at
home, Hariçcandra suffered from dropsy because of an attack from Varuëa.
When Rohita received the news that his father was suffering, he wanted to
return to the capital, but King Indra prevented him from doing so. Following
the instructions of Indra, Rohita lived in the forest for six years and then
returned home. Rohita purchased Çunaùçepha, the second son of Ajégarta, and
gave him to his father, Hariçcandra, as the sacrificial animal. In this way, the
sacrifice was performed, Varuëa and the other demigods were pacified, and
Hariçcandra was freed from disease. In this sacrifice, Viçvämitra was the hotä
priest, Jamadagni was the adhvaryu, Vasiñöha was the brahmä, and Ayäsya was
the udgätä. King Indra, being very satisfied by the sacrifice, gave Hariçcandra a
golden chariot, and Viçvämitra gave him transcendental knowledge. Thus
Çukadeva Gosvämé describes how Hariçcandra achieved perfection.

TRANSLATION
The son of Triçaìku was Hariçcandra. Because of Hariçcandra there was a
quarrel between Viçvämitra and Vasiñöha, who for many years fought one
another, having been transformed into birds.
PURPORT
Viçvämitra and Vasiñöha were always inimical. Formerly, Viçvämitra was a
kñatriya, and by undergoing severe austerities he wanted to become a
brähmaëa, but Vasiñöha would not agree to accept him. In this way there was
always disagreement between the two. Later, however, Vasiñöha accepted him
because of Viçvämitra's quality of forgiveness. Once Hariçcandra performed a
yajïa for which Viçvämitra was the priest, but Viçvämitra, being angry at
Hariçcandra, took away all his possessions, claiming them as a contribution of
dakñiëä. Vasiñöha, however, did not like this, and therefore a fight arose
between Vasiñöha and Viçvämitra. The fighting became so severe that each of
them cursed the other. One of them said, "May you become a bird," and the
other said, "May you become a duck." Thus both of them became birds and
continued fighting for many years because of Hariçcandra. We can see that
such a great mystic yogé as Saubhari became a victim of sense gratification, and
such great sages as Vasiñöha and Viçvämitra became birds. This is the material
world. Äbrahma-bhuvanäl lokäù punar ävartino 'rjuna [Bg. 8.16]. Within this
material world, or within this universe, however elevated one may be in
material qualities, one must suffer the conditions of birth, death, old age and
disease (janma-måtyu jarä-vyädhi [Bg. 13.9]). Therefore Kåñëa says that this
material world is simply miserable (duùkhälayam açäçvatam [Bg. 8.15]). The
Bhägavatam says, padaà padaà yad vipadäm: [SB 10.14.58] at every step here
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
270
there is danger. Therefore, because the Kåñëa consciousness movement
provides the opportunity for the human being to get out of this material world
simply by chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra, this movement is the greatest
benediction in human society.

sacrificial animal becomes a kñatriya and is able to shield himself to fight with
the enemy, then he will be purified."

as the sacrificial animal and offered Hariçcandra his respectful obeisances.

It appears that in those days a man could be purchased for any purpose.
Hariçcandra was in need of a person to sacrifice as the animal in a yajïa and
thus fulfill his promise to Varuëa, and a man was purchased from another man
for this purpose. Millions of years ago, animal sacrifice and slave trade both
existed. Indeed, they have existed since time immemorial.

TRANSLATION
Mahäräja Hariçcandra first purified his mind, which was full of material
enjoyment, by amalgamating it with the earth. Then he amalgamated the earth
with water, the water with fire, the fire with the air, and the air with the sky.
Thereafter, he amalgamated the sky with the total material energy, and the total
material energy with spiritual knowledge. This spiritual knowledge is realization
of one's self as part of the Supreme Lord. When the self-realized spiritual soul is
engaged in service to the Lord, he is eternally imperceptible and inconceivable.
Thus established in spiritual knowledge, he is completely freed from material
bondage.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Seventh Chapter, of the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Descendants of King Mändhätä."
8. The Sons of Sagara Meet Lord Kapiladeva
In this Eighth Chapter the descendants of Rohita are described. In the
dynasty of Rohita there was a king named Sagara, whose history is described in
relation to Kapiladeva and the destruction of the sons of Sagara.
The son of Rohita was known as Harita, and the son of Harita was Campa,
who constructed a township known as Campäpuré. The son of Campa was
Sudeva, the son of Sudeva was Vijaya, the son of Vijaya was Bharuka, and the
son of Bharuka was Våka. Bähuka, the son of Våka, was greatly disturbed by his
enemies, and therefore he left home with his wife and went to the forest.
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
286
When he died there, his wife wanted to accept the principles of saté, dying
with her husband, but when she was about to die a sage named Aurva found
that she was pregnant and forbade her to do so. The co-wives of this wife of
Bähuka gave her poison with her food, but still her son was born with the
poison. The son was therefore named Sagara (sa means "with," and gara means
"poison"). Following the instructions of the great sage Aurva, King Sagara
reformed many clans, including the Yavanas, Çakas, Haihayas and Barbaras.
The king did not kill them, but reformed them. Then, again following the
instructions of Aurva, King Sagara performed açvamedha sacrifices, but the
horse needed for such a sacrifice was stolen by Indra, the King of heaven. King
Sagara had two wives, named Sumati and Keçiné. While searching for the
horse, the sons of Sumati extensively dug up the surface of the earth and in
this way dug a trench, which later became known as the Sägara Ocean. In the
course of this search, they came upon the great personality Kapiladeva and
thought Him to have stolen the horse. With this offensive understanding, they
attacked Him and were all burned to ashes. Keçiné, the second wife of King
Sagara, had a son named Asamaïjasa, whose son Aàçumän later searched for
the horse and delivered his uncles. Upon approaching Kapiladeva, Aàçumän
saw both the horse meant for sacrifice and a pile of ashes. Aàçumän offered
prayers to Kapiladeva, who was very pleased by his prayers and who returned
the horse. After getting back the horse, however, Aàçumän still stood before
Kapiladeva, and Kapiladeva could understand that Aàçumän was praying for
the deliverance of his forefathers. Thus Kapiladeva offered the instruction
that they could be delivered by water from the Ganges. Aàçumän then offered
respectful obeisances to Kapiladeva, circumambulated Him, and left that place
with the horse for sacrifice. When King Sagara finished his yajïa, he handed
over the kingdom to Aàçumän and, following the advice of Aurva, attained
salvation.

[King Sagara had two wives, Sumati and Keçiné.] The sons of Sumati, who
were very proud of their prowess and influence, following the order of their
father, searched for the lost horse. While doing so, they dug into the earth very
extensively.

Thereafter, in the northeastern direction, they saw the horse near the
äçrama of Kapila Muni. "Here is the man who has stolen the horse," they said.
"He is staying there with closed eyes. Certainly he is very sinful. Kill him! Kill
him!" Shouting like this, the sons of Sagara, sixty thousand all together, raised
their weapons. When they approached the sage, the sage opened His eyes.

TRANSLATION
By the influence of Indra, the King of heaven, the sons of Sagara had lost
their intelligence and disrespected a great personality. Consequently, fire
emanated from their own bodies, and they were immediately burned to ashes.
PURPORT
The material body is a combination of earth, water, fire, air and ether.
There is already fire within the body, and our practical experience is that the
heat of this fire sometimes increases and sometimes decreases. The fire within
the bodies of the sons of Sagara Mahäräja became so much hotter that all of
them burned to ashes. The fire's increased heat was due to their misbehavior
toward a great personality. Such misbehavior is called mahad-vyatikrama. They
were killed by the fire of their own bodies because of insulting a great
personality.

TRANSLATION
It is sometimes argued that the sons of King Sagara were burned to ashes by
the fire emanating from the eyes of Kapila Muni. This statement, however, is
not approved by great learned persons, for Kapila Muni's body is completely in
the mode of goodness and therefore cannot manifest the mode of ignorance in
the form of anger, just as the pure sky cannot be polluted by the dust of the
earth.

TRANSLATION
Kapila Muni enunciated in this material world the Säìkhya philosophy,
which is a strong boat with which to cross over the ocean of nescience. Indeed,
a person eager to cross the ocean of the material world may take shelter of this
philosophy. In such a greatly learned person, situated on the elevated platform
of transcendence, how can there be any distinction between enemy and friend?
PURPORT
One who is promoted to the transcendental position (brahma-bhüta [SB
4.30.20]) is always jubilant (prasannätmä). He is unaffected by the false
distinctions between good and bad in the material world. Therefore, such an
exalted person is samaù sarveñu bhüteñu; that is to say, he is equal toward
everyone, not distinguishing between friend and enemy. Because he is on the
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
298
absolute platform, free from material contamination, he is called
parätma-bhüta or brahma-bhüta. Kapila Muni, therefore, was not at all angry at
the sons of Sagara Mahäräja; rather, they were burnt to ashes by the heat of
their own bodies.

but by bad association he had fallen from his exalted position. Now, in this life,
he was born in a royal family and was a jäti-smara; that is, he had the special
advantage of being able to remember his past birth. Nonetheless, he wanted to
display himself as a miscreant, and therefore he would do things that were
abominable in the eyes of the public and unfavorable to his relatives. He would
disturb the boys sporting in the River Sarayü by throwing them into the depths
of the water.

Because Asamaïjasa engaged in such abominable activities, his father gave
up affection for him and had him exiled. Then Asamaïjasa exhibited his mystic

After this, Asamaïjasa left Ayodhyä.
PURPORT
Asamaïjasa was a jäti-smara; because of his mystic power, he did not forget
his previous consciousness. Thus he could give life to the dead. By exhibiting
wonderful activities in relation to the dead children, he certainly attracted the
attention of the King and the people in general. Then he left that place
immediately.

demigods are generally in the mode of passion, and living entities lower than
the demigods, such as human beings and animals, are in the mode of
ignorance, or in mixed goodness, passion and ignorance. Therefore Aàçumän
wanted to explain that because his uncles, who had burnt to ashes, were under
the modes of material nature, they could not understand Lord Kapiladeva.
"Because You are beyond even the direct and indirect intelligence of Lord
Brahmä," he prayed, "unless we are enlightened by Your Lordship it will not be

My Lord, You are fully situated in everyone's heart, but the living entities,

see only the actions and reactions of these three modes of material nature.

nature; they cannot see Your Lordship.
PURPORT
Unless one is situated in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, one
is unable to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is
situated in everyone's heart. However, because the conditioned souls are
influenced by material nature, they can see only the actions and reactions of
material nature, but not the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One therefore

O my Lord, sages freed from the influence of the three modes of material

can an ignorant person like me think of You?
PURPORT
The word svabhäva refers to one's own spiritual nature or original
constitutional position. When situated in this original position, the living
entity is unaffected by the modes of material nature. Sa guëän samatétyaitän
brahma-bhüyäya kalpate (Bg. 14.26). As soon as one is freed from the influence
of the three modes of material nature, he is situated on the Brahman platform.
Vivid examples of personalities thus situated are the four Kumäras and
Närada. Such authorities can by nature understand the position of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, but a conditioned soul not freed from the
influence of material nature is unable to realize the Supreme. In Bhagavad-gétä
(2.45), therefore, Kåñëa advises Arjuna, traiguëya-viñayä vedä nistraiguëyo
bhavärjuna: one must rise above the influence of the three modes of material
nature. One who stays within the influence of the three material modes is
unable to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

"By serving You constantly, one is freed from all material desires and is
completely pacified. When shall I engage as Your permanent eternal servant
and always feel joyful to have such a fitting master?"
Manorathenäsati dhävato bahiù: [SB 5.18.12] one who acts on the mental
platform must descend to material activities. Material contamination,
however, is completely absent from the Supreme Personality of Godhead and
His pure devotee. Therefore the Lord is addressed as praçänta, completely
peaceful, free from the disturbances of material existence. The Supreme Lord
has no material name or form; only the foolish think that the Lord's name and
form are material (avajänanti mäà müòhä mänuñéà tanum äçritam [Bg. 9.11]).
The identity of the Supreme Lord is that He is the original person.
Nonetheless, those who have but a poor fund of knowledge think that the Lord
is formless. The Lord is formless in the material sense, but He has His
transcendental form (sac-cid-änanda-vigraha [Bs. 5.1]).

9. The Dynasty of Aàçumän
This chapter describes the history of the dynasty of Aàçumän, up to
Khaöväìga, and it also describes how Bhagératha brought the water of the
Ganges to this earth.
The son of Mahäräja Aàçumän was Dilépa, who tried to bring the Ganges
to this world but who died without success. Bhagératha, the son of Dilépa, was
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
316
determined to bring the Ganges to the material world, and for this purpose he
underwent severe austerities. Mother Ganges, being fully satisfied by his
austerities, made herself visible to him, wanting to give him a benediction.
Bhagératha then asked her to deliver his forefathers. Although mother Ganges
agreed to come down to earth, she made two conditions: first, she wanted some
suitable male to be able to control her waves; second, although all sinful men
would be freed from sinful reactions by bathing in the Ganges, mother Ganges
did not want to keep all these sinful reactions. These two conditions were
subject matters for consideration. Bhagératha replied to mother Ganges, "The
Personality of Godhead Lord Çiva will be completely able to control the waves
of your water, and when pure devotees bathe in your water, the sinful
reactions left by sinful men will be counteracted." Bhagératha then performed
austerities to satisfy Lord Çiva, who is called Äçutoña because he is naturally
satisfied very easily. Lord Çiva agreed to Bhagératha's proposal to check the
force of the Ganges. In this way, simply by the touch of the Ganges,
Bhagératha's forefathers were delivered and allowed to go to the heavenly
planets.
The son of Bhagératha was Çruta, the son of Çruta was Näbha, and Näbha's
son was Sindhudvépa. The son of Sindhudvépa was Ayutäyu, and the son of
Ayutäyu was Åtüparëa, who was a friend of Nala. Åtüparëa gave Nala the art
of gambling and learned from him the art of açva-vidyä. The son of Åtüparëa
was known as Sarvakäma, the son of Sarvakäma was Sudäsa, and his son was
Saudäsa. The wife of Saudäsa was named Damayanté or Madayanté, and
Saudäsa was also known as Kalmäñapäda. Because of some defect in his fruitive
activities, Saudäsa was cursed by Vasiñöha to become a Räkñasa. While walking
through the forest, he saw a brähmaëa engaged in sex with his wife, and
because he had become a Räkñasa he wanted to devour the brähmaëa.
Although the brähmaëa's wife pleaded with him in many ways, Saudäsa
devoured the brähmaëa, and the wife therefore cursed him, saying, "As soon as
you engage in sex you will die." After twelve years, therefore, even though
Saudäsa was released from the curse of Vasiñöha Muni, he remained sonless. At
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
317
that time, with Saudäsa's permission, Vasiñöha impregnated Saudäsa's wife,
Madayanté. Because Madayanté bore the child for many years but still could
not give birth, Vasiñöha struck her abdomen with a stone, and thus a son was
born. The son was named Açmaka.
The son of Açmaka was known as Bälika. He was protected from the curse
of Paraçuräma because of being surrounded by many women, and therefore he
is also known as Närékavaca. When the entire world was devoid of kñatriyas, he
became the original father of more kñatriyas. He is therefore sometimes called
Mülaka. From Bälika, Daçaratha was born, from Daçaratha came Aiòaviòi, and
from Aiòaviòi came Viçvasaha. The son of Viçvasaha was Mahäräja
Khaöväìga. Mahäräja Khaöväìga joined the demigods in fighting the demons
and was victorious, and the demigods therefore wanted to give him a
benediction. But when the King inquired how long he would live and
understood that his life would last only a few seconds more, he immediately
left the heavenly planets and returned to his own abode by airplane. He could
understand that everything in this material world is insignificant, and thus he
fully engaged in worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari.

O King, I do not wish to go down to the planet earth, for there the people in
general will bathe in my water to cleanse themselves of the reactions of their
sinful deeds. When all these sinful reactions accumulate in me, how shall I
become free from them? You must consider this very carefully.
PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead says:
sarva-dharmän parityajya
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
322
mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja
ahaà tväà sarva-päpebhyo
mokñayiñyämi mä çucaù
"Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver
you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear." (Bg. 18.66) The Supreme Personality
of Godhead can accept the reactions of anyone's sinful deeds and neutralize
them because He is pavitra, pure, like the sun, which is never contaminated by
any worldly infection. Tejéyasäà na doñäya vahneù sama-bhujo yathä (SB
10.33.29). One who is very powerful is not affected by any sinful activity. But
here we see that mother Ganges fears being burdened with the sins of the
people in general who would bathe in her waters. This indicates that no one
but the Supreme Personality of Godhead is able to neutralize the reactions of
sinful deeds, whether one's own or those of others. Sometimes the spiritual
master, after accepting a disciple, must take charge of that disciple's past sinful
activities and, being overloaded, must sometimes suffer—if not fully, then
partially—for the sinful acts of the disciple. Every disciple, therefore, must be
very careful not to commit sinful activities after initiation. The poor spiritual
master is kind and merciful enough to accept a disciple and partially suffer for
that disciple's sinful activities, but Kåñëa, being merciful to His servant,
neutralizes the reactions of sinful deeds for the servant who engages in
preaching His glories. Even mother Ganges feared the sinful reactions of the
people in general and was anxious about how she would counteract the burden
of these sins.

Bhagératha said: Those who are saintly because of devotional service and are
therefore in the renounced order, free from material desires, and who are pure
devotees, expert in following the regulative principles mentioned in the Vedas,
are always glorious and pure in behavior and are able to deliver all fallen souls.
When such pure devotees bathe in your water, the sinful reactions accumulated
from other people will certainly be counteracted, for such devotees always keep
in the core of their hearts the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who can
vanquish all sinful reactions.
PURPORT
Mother Ganges is available to everyone for bathing. Therefore, not only
will sinful persons bathe in the Ganges water, but in Hardwar and other holy
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
324
places where the Ganges flows, saintly persons and devotees will also bathe in
the waters of the Ganges. Devotees and saintly persons advanced in the
renounced order can deliver even the Ganges. Térthé-kurvanti térthäni
sväntaù-sthena gadäbhåtä (SB 1.13.10). Because saintly devotees always keep the
Lord within the core of their hearts, they can perfectly cleanse the holy places
of all sinful reactions. Therefore, people in general must always respectfully
honor saintly persons. It is ordered that as soon as one sees a Vaiñëava, or even
a sannyäsé, one should immediately offer respects to such a holy man. If one
forgets to show respect in this way, one must observe a fast for that day. This is
a Vedic injunction. One must be extremely careful to refrain from committing
offenses at the lotus feet of a devotee or saintly person.
There are methods of präyaçcitta, or atonement, but they are inadequate to
cleanse one of sinful reactions. One can be cleansed of sinful reactions only by
devotional service, as stated in regard to the history of Ajämila:
kecit kevalayä bhaktyä
väsudeva-paräyaëäù
aghaà dhunvanti kärtsnyena
néhäram iva bhäskaraù
"Only a rare person who has adopted complete, unalloyed devotional service to
Kåñëa can uproot the weeds of sinful actions with no possibility that they will
revive. He can do this simply by discharging devotional service, just as the sun
can immediately dissipate fog by its rays." (SB 6.1.15) If one is under the
protection of a devotee and sincerely renders service unto him, by this process
of bhakti-yoga one is certainly able to counteract all sinful reactions.

TRANSLATION
Like a cloth woven of threads extending for its length and breadth, this
entire universe, in all its latitude and longitude, is situated under different
potencies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Çiva is the incarnation
of the Lord, and thus he represents the Supersoul in the embodied soul. He can
sustain your forceful waves on his head.
PURPORT
The water of the Ganges is supposed to rest on the head of Lord Çiva. Lord
Çiva is an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who sustains
the entire universe by different potencies. Lord Çiva is described in the
Brahma-saàhitä (5.45):
kñéraà yathä dadhi vikära-viçeña-yogät

yaù çambhutäm api tathä samupaiti käryäd

"Milk changes into yogurt when mixed with a yogurt culture, but actually
yogurt is constitutionally nothing but milk. Similarly, Govinda, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, assumes the form of Lord Çiva for the special purpose
of material transactions. I offer my obeisances at Lord Govinda's lotus feet."
Lord Çiva is the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the same sense that yogurt
is also milk although at the same time it is not milk. For the maintenance of
the material world there are three incarnations—Brahmä, Viñëu and
Maheçvara (Lord Çiva). Lord Çiva is Viñëu in an incarnation for the mode of
ignorance. The material world exists predominantly in the mode of ignorance.
Therefore Lord Çiva is compared here to the longitude and latitude of the
entire universe, which resembles a cloth woven of threads extending for both
its length and breadth.

TRANSLATION
After saying this, Bhagératha satisfied Lord Çiva by performing austerities. O
King Parékñit, Lord Çiva was very quickly satisfied with Bhagératha.
PURPORT
The words äçv atuñyata indicate that Lord Çiva was satisfied very soon.
Therefore another name for Lord Çiva is Äçutoña. Materialistic persons
become attached to Lord Çiva because Lord Çiva bestows benedictions upon
anyone and everyone very quickly, not caring to know how his devotees
prosper or suffer. Although materialistic persons know that material happiness
is nothing but another side of suffering, they want it, and to get it very quickly
they worship Lord Çiva. We find that materialists are generally devotees of
many demigods, especially Lord Çiva and mother Durgä. They do not actually
want spiritual happiness, for it is almost unknown to them. But if one is serious
about being happy spiritually, he must take shelter of Lord Viñëu, as the Lord
personally demands:

When King Bhagératha approached Lord Çiva and requested him to sustain
the forceful waves of the Ganges, Lord Çiva accepted the proposal by saying,
"Let it be so." Then, with great attention, he sustained the Ganges on his head,
for the water of the Ganges is purifying, having emanated from the toes of Lord
Viñëu.

heat of their bodies had increased, and they were burnt to ashes. But simply by
being sprinkled with water from the Ganges, all of them became eligible to go to
the heavenly planets. What then is to be said of those who use the water of
mother Ganges to worship her?
PURPORT
Mother Ganges is worshiped by the water of the Ganges: a devotee takes a
little water from the Ganges and offers it back to the Ganges. When the
devotee takes the water, mother Ganges does not lose anything, and when the
water is offered back, mother Ganges does not increase, but in this way the
worshiper of the Ganges is benefited. Similarly, a devotee of the Lord offers
the Lord patraà puñpaà phalaà toyam [Bg. 9.26]—a leaf, flower, fruit or
water—in great devotion, but everything, including the leaf, flower, fruit and
water, belongs to the Lord, and therefore there is nothing to renounce or to
accept. One must simply take advantage of the bhakti process because by
following this process one does not lose anything but one gains the favor of the
Supreme Person.

Simply by having water from the Ganges come in contact with the ashes of
their burnt bodies, the sons of Sagara Mahäräja were elevated to the heavenly

faithfully with a determined vow? One can only imagine the benefit that
accrues to such a devotee.

TRANSLATION
Because mother Ganges emanates from the lotus toe of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Anantadeva, she is able to liberate one from material
bondage. Therefore whatever is described herewith about her is not at all
wonderful.
PURPORT
It has actually been seen that anyone who regularly worships mother
Ganges simply by bathing in her water keeps very good health and gradually
becomes a devotee of the Lord. This is the effect of bathing in the water of the
Ganges. Bathing in the Ganges is recommended in all Vedic çästras, and one
who takes to this path will certainly be completely freed from all sinful
reactions. The practical example of this is that the sons of Mahäräja Sagara
went to the heavenly planets when water from the Ganges merely touched the
ashes of their burnt bodies.

Great sages, completely freed from material lusty desires, devote their minds

bondage without difficulty, and they become transcendentally situated,

Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Bhagératha had a son named Çruta, whose son was Näbha. This son was
different from the Näbha previously described. Näbha had a son named
Sindhudvépa, from Sindhudvépa came Ayutäyu, and from Ayutäyu came
Åtüparëa, who became a friend of Nalaräja. Åtüparëa taught Nalaräja the art of
gambling, and Nalaräja gave Åtüparëa lessons in controlling and maintaining
horses. The son of Åtüparëa was Sarvakäma.
PURPORT
Gambling is also an art. Kñatriyas are allowed to exhibit talent in this art of
gambling. By the grace of Kåñëa, the Päëòavas lost everything by gambling and
were deprived of their kingdom, wife, family and home because they were not
expert in the gambling art. In other words, a devotee may not be expert in
materialistic activities. It is therefore advised in the çästra that materialistic
activities are not at all suitable for the living entities, especially the devotees.
A devotee should therefore be satisfied to eat whatever is sent as prasäda by
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com

the Supreme Lord. A devotee remains pure because he does not take to sinful
activities such as gambling, intoxication, meat-eating and illicit sex.

The body of a human being is extremely valuable because in this body one can
understand the instructions of Kåñëa and attain the ultimate destination of
the living entity. The living entity is within the material world to fulfill the
mission of going back home, back to Godhead. In the material world, one
hankers for happiness, but because one does not know the ultimate
destination, one changes bodies one after another. However, if one gets the
opportunity to possess a human form of body, in this body he can fulfill the
four principles of dharma, artha, käma and mokña, and if one is properly
regulated he makes further progress, after liberation, to engage in the service
of Rädhä and Kåñëa. This is the success of life: to stop the process of repeated
birth and death and go back home, back to Godhead (mäm eti), to be engaged
in the service of Rädhä and Kåñëa. Therefore, taking a human body is meant
for completing one's progress in life. Throughout human society, killing of a
human being is taken very seriously. Hundreds and thousands of animals are
killed in slaughterhouses, and no one cares about them, but the killing of even
one human being is taken very seriously. Why? Because the human form of
body is extremely important in executing the mission of life.

in Vedic knowledge; tapaù—austerity; çéla—good behavior;
guëa-anvitaù—endowed with all good qualities; ärirädhayiñuù—desiring to be
engaged in worshiping; brahma—the Supreme Brahman; mahä-puruña—the
Supreme Person, Kåñëa; saàjïitam—known as; sarva-bhüta—of all living
entities; ätma-bhävena—as the Supersoul; bhüteñu—in every living entity;
antarhitam—within the core of the heart; guëaiù—by qualities.
TRANSLATION
Here is a learned, highly qualified brähmaëa, engaged in performing
austerity and eagerly desiring to worship the Supreme Lord, the Supersoul who
lives within the core of the heart in all living entities.
PURPORT
The wife of the brähmaëa did not regard her husband as a superficial
brähmaëa who was called a brähmaëa merely because he was born of a
brähmaëa family. Rather, this brähmaëa was actually qualified with the
brahminical symptoms. Yasya yal lakñaëaà proktam (SB 7.11.35). The
symptoms of a brähmaëa are stated in the çästra:
çamo damas tapaù çaucaà
kñäntir ärjavam eva ca
jïänaà vijïänam ästikyaà
brahma-karma svabhävajam
"Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, wisdom,
knowledge, and religiousness-these are the qualities by which the brähmaëas
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com

work." (Bg. 18.42) Not only must a brähmaëa be qualified, but he must also
engage in actual brahminical activities. Simply to be qualified is not enough;
one must engage in a brähmaëa's duties. The duty of a brähmaëa is to know
the paraà brahma, Kåñëa (paraà brahma paraà dhäma pavitraà paramaà
bhavän [Bg. 10.12]). Because this brähmaëa was actually qualified and was also
engaged in brahminical activities (brahma-karma [Bg. 18.42]), killing him
would be a greatly sinful act, and the brähmaëa's wife requested that he not be
killed.

but the best of great sages, or brahmarñis; te—also from you;
räja-åñi-pravarät—who are the best of all saintly kings, or räjarñis; vibho—O
master of the state; katham—how; arhati—he deserves; dharma-jïa—O you,
who are quite aware of religious principles; vadham—killing; pituù—from the
father; iva—like; ätmajaù—the son.
TRANSLATION
My lord, you are completely aware of the religious principles. As a son never

deserves to be killed by his father, here is a brähmaëa who should be protected
by the king, and never killed. How does he deserve to be killed by a räjarñi like
you?
PURPORT
The word räjarñi refers to a king who behaves like a åñi, or sage. Such a king
is also called naradeva because he is considered a representative of the
Supreme Lord. Because his duty is to rule the kingdom to maintain
brahminical culture, he never desires to kill a brähmaëa. Generally, a
brähmaëa, woman, child, old man or cow is never regarded as punishable. Thus
the wife of the brähmaëa requested the King to refrain from this sinful act.

TRANSLATION
You are well known and worshiped in learned circles. How dare you kill this
brähmaëa, who is a saintly, sinless person, well versed in Vedic knowledge?
Killing him would be like destroying the embryo within the womb or killing a
cow.
PURPORT
As stated in the Amara-koça dictionary, bhrüëo 'rbhake bäla-garbhe: the
word bhrüëa refers either to the cow or to the living entity in embryo.
According to Vedic culture, destroying the undeveloped embryo of the soul in
the womb is as sinful as killing a cow or a brähmaëa. In the embryo, the living
entity is present in an undeveloped stage. The modern scientific theory that
life is a combination of chemicals is nonsense; scientists cannot manufacture
living beings, even like those born from eggs. The idea that scientists can
develop a chemical situation resembling that of an egg and bring life from it is
nonsensical. Their theory that a chemical combination can have life may be
accepted, but these rascals cannot create such a combination. This verse refers
to bhrüëasya vadham—the killing of a bhrüëa or destruction of the embryo.
Here is a challenge from the Vedic literature. The crude, atheistic
understanding that the living entity is a combination of matter belongs to the
grossest ignorance.

TRANSLATION
Without my husband, I cannot live for a moment. If you want to eat my
husband, it would be better to eat me first, for without my husband I am as
good as a dead body.
PURPORT
In the Vedic culture there is a system known as saté or saha-maraëa, in
which a woman dies with her husband. According to this system, if the
husband dies, the wife will voluntarily die by falling in the blazing funeral pyre
of her husband. Here, in this verse, the feelings inherent in this culture are
expressed by the wife of the brähmaëa. A woman without a husband is like a
dead body. Therefore according to Vedic culture a girl must be married. This is
the responsibility of her father. A girl may be given in charity, and a husband
may have more than one wife, but a girl must be married. This is Vedic culture.
A woman is supposed to be always dependent—in her childhood she is
dependent on her father, in youth on her husband, and in old age on her
elderly sons. According to Manu-saàhitä, she is never independent.
Independence for a woman means miserable life. In this age, so many girls are
unmarried and falsely imagining themselves free, but their life is miserable.
Here is an instance in which a woman felt that without her husband she was

350
nothing but a dead body.

TRANSLATION
Being condemned by the curse of Vasiñöha, King Saudäsa devoured the
brähmaëa, exactly as a tiger eats its prey. Even though the brähmaëa's wife
spoke so pitiably, Saudäsa was unmoved by her lamentation.
PURPORT
This is an example of destiny. King Saudäsa was condemned by the curse of
Vasiñöha, and therefore even though he was well qualified he could not
restrain himself from becoming a tigerlike Räkñasa, for this was his destiny. Tal
labhyate duùkhavad anyataù sukham (SB 1.5.18). As one is put into distress by

strong, but one can change destiny if one comes to the platform of Kåñëa
consciousness. Karmäëi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhäjäm (Bs. 5.54).

King Khaöväìga was unconquerable in any fight. Requested by the demigods
to join them in fighting the demons, he won victory, and the demigods, being
very pleased, wanted to give him a benediction. The King inquired from them
about the duration of his life and was informed that he had only one moment
more. Thus he immediately left his palace and went to his own residence, where
he engaged his mind fully on the lotus feet of the Lord.
PURPORT
The example of Mahäräja Khaöväìga in performing devotional service is
brilliant. Mahäräja Khaöväìga engaged himself for only a moment in
devotional service to the Lord, but he was promoted back to Godhead.
Therefore, if one practices devotional service from the beginning of his life,
surely he will return home, back to Godhead, without a doubt (asaàçaya).
In Bhagavad-gétä the word asaàçaya is used to describe the devotee. There
the Lord Himself gives this instruction:
mayy äsakta-manäù pärtha
yogaà yuïjan mad-äçrayaù
asaàçayaà samagraà mäà
yathä jïäsyasi tac chåëu
"Now hear, O son of Påthä [Arjuna], how by practicing yoga in full
consciousness of Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full, free
from doubt." (Bg. 7.1)
The Lord also instructs:
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
359
janma karma ca me divyam
evaà yo vetti tattvataù
tyaktvä dehaà punar janma
naiti mäm eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities
does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but
attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna." (Bg. 4.9)
Therefore, from the very beginning of one's life one should practice
bhakti-yoga, which increases one's attachment for Kåñëa. If one daily sees the
Deity in the temple, makes offerings by worshiping the Deity, chants the holy
name of the Personality of Godhead, and preaches about the glorious activities
of the Lord as much as possible, he thus becomes attached to Kåñëa. This
attachment is called äsakti. When one's mind is attached to Kåñëa (mayy
äsakta-manäù), one can fulfill the mission of life in one human birth. If one
misses this opportunity, one does not know where he is going, how long he will
remain in the cycle of birth and death, and when he will again achieve the
human form of life and the chance to return home, back to Godhead. The
most intelligent person, therefore, uses every moment of his life to render
loving service to the Lord.

Mahäräja Khaöväìga thought: Not even my life is dearer to me than the
brahminical culture and the brähmaëas, who are worshiped by my family. What
then is to be said of my kingdom, land, wife, children and opulence? Nothing is
dearer to me than the brähmaëas.
PURPORT
Mahäräja Khaöväìga, being in favor of the brahminical culture, wanted to
utilize one moment's time by fully surrendering unto the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. The Lord is worshiped with this prayer:
namo brähmaëya-deväya
go brähmaëa-hitäya ca
jagad-dhitäya kåñëäya
govindäya namo namaù
"I offer my respectful obeisances to the Supreme Absolute Truth, Kåñëa, who is
the well-wisher of the cows and the brähmaëas as well as the living entities in
general. I offer my repeated obeisances to Govinda, who is the pleasure
reservoir for all the senses." A devotee of Kåñëa is very much attached to
brahminical culture. Indeed, an expert personality who knows who Kåñëa is
and what He wants is a real brähmaëa. Brahma jänätéti brähmaëaù. Kåñëa is

the Parabrahman, and therefore all Kåñëa conscious persons, or devotees of
Kåñëa, are exalted brähmaëas. Khaöväìga Mahäräja regarded the devotees of
Kåñëa as the real brähmaëas and the real light for human society. One who
desires to advance in Kåñëa consciousness and spiritual understanding must
give the utmost importance to brahminical culture and must understand Kåñëa
(kåñëäya govindäya). Then his life will be successful.

Mahäräja Khaöväìga provides a typical example of a Kåñëa conscious
person. A Kåñëa conscious person does not see anything to be important but
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, nor does he accept anything within this
material world as being unconnected to the Supreme Lord. As stated in
Caitanya-caritämåta (Madhya 8.274):
sthävara-jaìgama dekhe, nä dekhe tära mürti
sarvatra haya nija iñöa-deva-sphürti
"The mahä-bhägavata, the advanced devotee, certainly sees everything mobile
and immobile, but he does not exactly see their forms. Rather, everywhere he
immediately sees manifest the form of the Supreme Lord." Although a devotee
is within the material world, he has no connection with it. Nirbandhaù
kåñëa-sambandhe. He accepts this material world in relationship with the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. A devotee may be engaged in earning
money, but he uses that money for propagating the Kåñëa consciousness
movement by constructing large temples and establishing worship of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Khaöväìga Mahäräja, therefore, was not a
materialist. A materialist is always attached to wife, children, home, property
and many other things for sense gratification, but, as stated above, Khaöväìga
Mahäräja was not attached to such things, nor could he think of anything
existing without the purpose of the Supreme Lord. Éçäväsyam idaà sarvam: [Éço
mantra 1] everything is related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Of
course, this consciousness is not for the ordinary person, but if one takes to the
path of devotional service, as prescribed in The Nectar of Devotion, he can be
trained in this consciousness and attain perfect understanding. For a Kåñëa
conscious person, nothing is palatable without a relationship with Kåñëa.

TRANSLATION
The demigods, the directors of the three worlds, wanted to give me whatever
benediction I desired. I did not want their benedictions, however, because I am
interested in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who created everything in

Godhead than in all material benedictions.
PURPORT
A devotee is always transcendentally situated. paraà dåñövä nivartate: [Bg.
9.59] one who has seen the Supreme Personality of Godhead is no longer
interested in material sense enjoyment. Even such an exalted devotee as
Dhruva Mahäräja went to the forest for the sake of material benefit, but when
he actually saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he refused to accept any

material benediction. He said, svämin kåtärtho 'smi varaà na yäce: [Cc. Madhya
22.42] "My dear Lord, I am fully satisfied with whatever You have given me or
not given me. I have nothing to ask from You, for I am fully satisfied to be
engaged in Your service." This is the mentality of a pure devotee, who does not
want anything, material or spiritual, from the Personality of Godhead. Our
Kåñëa consciousness movement is therefore called kåñëa-bhävanämåta-saìgha,
the association of persons who are simply satisfied in thoughts of Kåñëa. Being
absorbed in thoughts of Kåñëa is neither expensive nor troublesome. Kåñëa
says, man-manä bhava mad-bhakto mad-yäjé mäà namaskuru: [Bg. 18.65]
"Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, offer obeisances and worship
Me." (Bg. 9.34) Anyone can always think of Kåñëa, without difficulties or
obstacles. This is called kåñëa-bhävanämåta. One who is absorbed in
kåñëa-bhävanämåta has no material benefits to ask from Kåñëa. Instead, such a
person prays to the Lord for the benediction of being able to spread His glories
all over the world. Mama janmani janmanéçvare bhavatäd bhaktir ahaituké tvayi
[Cc. Antya 20.29, Çikñäñöaka 4]. A Kåñëa conscious person does not even want
to stop his cycle of birth and death. He simply prays, "I may take birth as You
like, but my only prayer is that I may be engaged in Your service."

TRANSLATION
Even though the demigods have the advantages of being situated in the
higher planetary system, their minds, senses and intelligence are agitated by
material conditions. Therefore, even such elevated persons fail to realize the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is eternally situated in the core of the
heart. What then is to be said of others, such as human beings, who have fewer
advantages?
PURPORT
It is a fact that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always situated in
everyone's heart (éçvaraù sarva-bhütänäà håd-deçe 'rjuna tiñöhati [Bg. 18.61]).
But because of our material anxieties, which are inevitable in this material
world, we cannot understand the Supreme Lord, although He is situated so
near to us. For those always agitated by material conditions, the yogic process
is recommended so that one may concentrate his mind upon the Supreme
Personality of Godhead within the heart. Dhyänävasthita-tad-gatena manasä
paçyanti yaà yoginaù [SB 12.13.1]. Because in material conditions the mind and
senses are always agitated, by the yogic procedures like dhäraëä, äsana and
dhyäna one must quiet the mind and concentrate it upon the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. In other words, the yogic process is a material attempt
to realize the Lord, whereas bhakti, devotional service, is the spiritual process
by which to realize Him. Mahäräja Khaöväìga accepted the spiritual path, and
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com

therefore he was no longer interested in anything material. Kåñëa says in
Bhagavad-gétä (18.55), bhaktyä mäm abhijänäti: "Only by devotional service can
I be understood." One can understand Kåñëa, the Parabrahman, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, only through devotional service. The Lord never says
that one can understand Him by performing mystic yoga or by philosophically
speculating. Bhakti is above all such material attempts. Anyäbhiläñitä-çünyaà
jïäna-karmädy-anävåtam [Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 1.1.11(3)]. Bhakti is
uncontaminated, being unalloyed even by jïäna or pious activities.

TRANSLATION
Therefore I should now give up my attachment for things created by the
external energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I should engage in
thought of the Lord and should thus surrender unto Him. This material
creation, having been created by the external energy of the Lord, is like an
imaginary town visualized on a hill or in a forest. Every conditioned soul has a
natural attraction and attachment for material things, but one must simply give
up this attachment and surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
PURPORT
When passing through a mountainous region in an airplane, one may
sometimes see a city in the sky with towers and palaces, or one may see similar
things in a big forest. This is called a gandharva-pura, a phantasmagoria. This
entire world resembles such a phantasmagoria, and every materially situated
person has attachment for it. But Khaöväìga Mahäräja, because of his
advanced Kåñëa consciousness, was not interested in such things. Even though
a devotee may engage in apparently materialistic activities, he knows his
position very well. Nirbandhaù kåñëa-sambandhe yuktaà vairägyam ucyate. If
one engages all material things in relation with the loving service of the Lord,
one is situated in yukta-vairägya, proper renunciation. In this material world,
nothing should be accepted for one's sense gratification: everything should be
accepted for the service of the Lord. This is the mentality of the spiritual
world. Mahäräja Khaöväìga advises that one give up material attachments and
surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus one achieves
success in life. This is pure bhakti-yoga, which involves
vairägya-vidyä—renunciation and knowledge.

inaugurated this movement of vairägya-vidyä, by which one detaches himself
from material existence and engages in loving devotional service. The Kåñëa

counteract our false prestige in this material world.

Thus Mahäräja Khaöväìga, by his advanced intelligence in rendering service
to the Lord, gave up false identification with the body full of ignorance. In his
original position of eternal servitorship, he engaged himself in rendering service
to the Lord.
PURPORT
When one actually becomes purely Kåñëa conscious, no one has any right to
rule over him. When situated in Kåñëa consciousness, one is no longer in the
darkness of ignorance, and when freed from all such darkness, one is situated
in his original position. Jévera 'svarüpa' haya-kåñëera 'nitya-däsa.' [Cc. Madhya

he engages himself in the service of the Lord in all respects, he enjoys the
perfection of life.

As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.2.11):
vadanti tat tattva-vidas
tattvaà yaj jïänam advayam
brahmeti paramätmeti
bhagavän iti çabdyate
The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases-as Brahman, Paramätmä and
Bhagavän. Bhagavän is the origin of everything. Brahman is a partial
representation of Bhagavän, and Väsudeva, the Supersoul living everywhere
and in everyone's heart, is also an advanced realization of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. But when one comes to understand the Supreme
Personality of Godhead (väsudevaù sarvam iti), when one realizes that
Väsudeva is both Paramätmä and the impersonal Brahman, he is then in
perfect knowledge. Kåñëa is therefore described by Arjuna as paraà brahma
paraà dhäma pavitraà paramaà bhavän [Bg. 10.12]. The words paraà brahma
refer to the shelter of the impersonal Brahman and also of the all-pervading
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
371
Supersoul. When Kåñëa says tyaktvä dehaà punar janma naiti mäm eti [Bg. 4.9],
this means that the perfect devotee, after perfect realization, returns home,
back to Godhead. Mahäräja Khaöväìga accepted the shelter of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, and because of his full surrender he achieved
perfection.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Ninth Chapter, of the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Dynasty of Aàçumän."
10. The Pastimes of the Supreme Lord, Rämacandra
This Tenth Chapter describes how Lord Rämacandra appeared in the
dynasty of Mahäräja Khaöväìga. It also describes the Lord's activities, telling
how He killed Rävaëa and returned to Ayodhyä, the capital of His kingdom.
The son of Mahäräja Khaöväìga was Dérghabähu, and his son was Raghu.
The son of Raghu was Aja, the son of Aja was Daçaratha, and the son of
Daçaratha was Lord Rämacandra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When
the Lord descended into this world in His full quadruple expansion-as Lord
Rämacandra, Lakñmaëa, Bharata and Çatrughna-great sages like Välméki who
were actually in knowledge of the Absolute Truth described His
transcendental pastimes. Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé describes these pastimes in
brief.
Lord Rämacandra went with Viçvämitra and killed Räkñasas like Märéca.
After breaking the stout and strong bow known as Haradhanu, the Lord
married mother Sétä and cut down the prestige of Paraçuräma. To obey the
order of His father, He entered the forest, accompanied by Lakñmaëa and Sétä.
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
372
There He cut off the nose of Çürpaëakhä and killed the associates of Rävaëa,
headed by Khara and Düñaëa. Rävaëa's kidnapping of Sétädevé was the
beginning of this demon's misfortune. When Märéca assumed the form of a
golden deer, Lord Rämacandra went to bring the deer to please Sétädevé, but in
the meantime Rävaëa took advantage of the Lord's absence to kidnap her.
When Sétädevé was kidnapped, Lord Rämacandra, accompanied by Lakñmaëa,
searched for her throughout the forest. In the course of this search, They met
Jaöäyu. Then the Lord killed the demon Kabandha and the commander Väli
and established a friendly relationship with Sugréva. After organizing the
military strength of the monkeys and going with them to the shore of the sea,
the Lord awaited the arrival of Samudra, the ocean personified, but when
Samudra did not come, the Lord, the master of Samudra, became angry. Then
Samudra came to the Lord with great haste and surrendered to Him, wanting
to help Him in every way. The Lord then attempted to bridge the ocean, and,
with the help of advice from Vibhéñaëa, He attacked Rävaëa's capital, Laìkä.
Previously, Hanumän, the eternal servant of the Lord, had set fire to Laìkä,
and now, with the help of Lakñmaëa, the forces of Lord Rämacandra killed all
the Räkñasa soldiers. Then Lord Rämacandra personally killed Rävaëa.
Mandodaré and other wives lamented for Rävaëa, and in accordance with Lord
Rämacandra's order, Vibhéñaëa performed the funeral ceremonies for all the
dead in the family. Lord Rämacandra then gave Vibhéñaëa the right to rule
Laìkä and also granted him a long duration of life. The Lord delivered
Sétädevé from the Açoka forest and carried her in a flower airplane to His
capital Ayodhyä, where He was received by His brother Bharata. When Lord
Rämacandra entered Ayodhyä, Bharata brought His wooden shoes, Vibhéñaëa
and Sugréva held a whisk and fan, Hanumän carried an umbrella, Çatrughna
carried the Lord's bow and two quivers, and Sétädevé carried a waterpot
containing water from holy places. Aìgada carried a sword, and Jämbavän
(Åkñaräja) carried a shield. After Lord Rämacandra, accompanied by Lord
Lakñmaëa and mother Sétädevé, met all His relatives, the great sage Vasiñöha
enthroned Him as King. The chapter ends with a short description of Lord

PURPORT
Lord Rämacandra and His brothers, Lakñmaëa, Bharata and Çatrughna, are
all viñëu-tattva, not jéva-tattva. The Supreme Personality of Godhead expands
into many, many forms. Advaitam acyutam anädim ananta-rüpam [Bs. 5.33].
Although they are one and the same, viñëu-tattva has many forms and
incarnations. As confirmed in the Brahma-saàhitä (5.39), rämädi-mürtiñu
kalä-niyamena tiñöhan. The Lord is situated in many forms, such as Räma,
Lakñmaëa, Bharata and Çatrughna, and these forms may exist in any part of
His creation. All these forms exist permanently, eternally, as individual
Personalities of Godhead, and they resemble many candles, all equally
powerful. Lord Rämacandra, Lakñmaëa, Bharata and Çatrughna, who, being
viñëu-tattva, are all equally powerful, became the sons of Mahäräja Daçaratha
in response to prayers by the demigods.

O King Parékñit, the transcendental activities of Lord Rämacandra have been
described by great saintly persons who have seen the truth. Because you have
heard again and again about Lord Rämacandra, the husband of mother Sétä, I
shall describe these activities only in brief. Please listen.
PURPORT
Modern Räkñasas, posing as educationally advanced merely because they
have doctorates, have tried to prove that Lord Rämacandra is not the Supreme
Personality of Godhead but an ordinary person. But those who are learned and
spiritually advanced will never accept such notions; they will accept the
descriptions of Lord Rämacandra and His activities only as presented by
tattva-darçés, those who know the Absolute Truth. In Bhagavad-gétä (4.34) the
Supreme Personality of Godhead advises:
tad viddhi praëipätena
paripraçnena sevayä
upadekñyanti te jïänaà
jïäninas tattva-darçinaù
"Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him
submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart
knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth." Unless one is tattva-darçé,
in complete knowledge of the Absolute Truth, one cannot describe the
activities of the Personality of Godhead. Therefore although there are many
so-called Rämäyaëas, or histories of Lord Rämacandra's activities, some of
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
377
them are not actually authoritative. Sometimes Lord Rämacandra's activities
are described in terms of one's own imaginations, speculations or material
sentiments. But the characteristics of Lord Rämacandra should not be handled
as something imaginary. While describing the history of Lord Rämacandra,
Çukadeva Gosvämé told Mahäräja Parékñit, "You have already heard about the
activities of Lord Rämacandra." Apparently, therefore, five thousand years ago
there were many Rämäyaëas, or histories of Lord Rämacandra's activities, and

tattva-darçés (jïäninas tattva-darçinaù [Bg. 4.34]), not the books of so-called
scholars who claim knowledge only on the basis of a doctorate. This is a
warning by Çukadeva Gosvämé. Åñibhis tattva-darçibhiù. Although the

TRANSLATION
To keep the promise of His father intact, Lord Rämacandra immediately
gave up the position of king and, accompanied by His wife, mother Sétä,
wandered from one forest to another on His lotus feet, which were so delicate
that they were unable to bear even the touch of Sétä's palms. The Lord was also
accompanied by Hanumän [or by another monkey, Sugréva], king of the
monkeys, and by His own younger brother Lord Lakñmaëa, both of whom gave
Him relief from the fatigue of wandering in the forest. Having cut off the nose
and ears of Çürpaëakhä, thus disfiguring her, the Lord was separated from
mother Sétä. He therefore became angry, moving His eyebrows and thus
frightening the ocean, who then allowed the Lord to construct a bridge to cross
the ocean. Subsequently, the Lord entered the kingdom of Rävaëa to kill him,
like a fire devouring a forest. May that Supreme Lord, Rämacandra, give us all
protection.

TRANSLATION
O King, the pastimes of Lord Rämacandra were wonderful, like those of a
baby elephant. In the assembly where mother Sétä was to choose her husband,
in the midst of the heroes of this world, He broke the bow belonging to Lord
Çiva. This bow was so heavy that it was carried by three hundred men, but
Lord Rämacandra bent and strung it and broke it in the middle, just as a baby
elephant breaks a stick of sugarcane. Thus the Lord achieved the hand of
mother Sétä, who was equally as endowed with transcendental qualities of form,
beauty, behavior, age and nature. Indeed, she was the goddess of fortune who
constantly rests on the chest of the Lord. While returning from Sétä's home
after gaining her at the assembly of competitors, Lord Rämacandra met
Paraçuräma. Although Paraçuräma was very proud, having rid the earth of the
royal order twenty-one times, he was defeated by the Lord, who appeared to be
a kñatriya of the royal order.

PURPORT
Mahäräja Daçaratha had three wives. One of them, Kaikeyé, served him
very pleasingly, and he therefore wanted to give her a benediction. Kaikeyé,
however, said that she would ask for the benediction when it was necessary. At
the time of the coronation of Prince Rämacandra, Kaikeyé requested her
husband to enthrone her son Bharata and send Rämacandra to the forest.
Mahäräja Daçaratha, being bound by his promise, ordered Rämacandra to go to
the forest, according to the dictation of his beloved. And the Lord, as an
obedient son, accepted the order immediately. He left everything without
hesitation, just as a liberated soul or great yogé gives up his life without
material attraction.

When Rämacandra entered the forest and Lakñmaëa was also absent, the
worst of the Räkñasas, Rävaëa, kidnapped Sétädevé, the daughter of the King of
Videha, just as a tiger seizes unprotected sheep when the shepherd is absent.
Then Lord Rämacandra wandered in the forest with His brother Lakñmaëa as if
very much distressed due to separation from His wife. Thus He showed by His
personal example the condition of a person attached to women.
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
386
PURPORT
In this verse the words stré-saìginäà gatim iti indicate that the condition of
a person attached to women was shown by the Lord Himself. According to
moral instructions, gåhe näréà vivarjayet: when one goes on a tour, one should
not bring his wife. Formerly men used to travel without conveyances, but still,
as far as possible, when one leaves home one should not take his wife with him,
especially if one is in such a condition as Lord Rämacandra when banished by
the order of His father. Whether in the forest or at home, if one is attached to
women this attachment is always troublesome, as shown by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead by His personal example.
Of course, this is the material side of stré-saìgé, but the situation of Lord
Rämacandra is spiritual, for He does not belong to the material world.
Näräyaëaù paro 'vyaktät: Näräyaëa is beyond the material creation. Because
He is the creator of the material world, He is not subject to the conditions of
the material world. The separation of Lord Rämacandra from Sétä is spiritually
understood as vipralambha, which is an activity of the hlädiné potency of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead belonging to the çåìgära-rasa, the mellow of
conjugal love in the spiritual world. In the spiritual world the Supreme
Personality of Godhead has all the dealings of love, displaying the symptoms
called sättvika, saïcäré, viläpa, mürcchä and unmäda. Thus when Lord
Rämacandra was separated from Sétä, all these spiritual symptoms were
manifested. The Lord is neither impersonal nor impotent. Rather, He is
sac-cid-änanda-vigraha [Bs. 5.1], the eternal form of knowledge and bliss. Thus
He has all the symptoms of spiritual bliss. Feeling separation from one's
beloved is also an item of spiritual bliss. As explained by Çréla Svarüpa
Dämodara Gosvämé, rädhä-kåñëa-praëaya-vikåtir hlädiné-çaktiù: the dealings of
love between Rädhä and Kåñëa are displayed as the pleasure potency of the
Lord. The Lord is the original source of all pleasure, the reservoir of all
pleasure. Lord Rämacandra, therefore, manifested the truth both spiritually
and materially. Materially those who are attached to women suffer, but
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
387
spiritually when there are feelings of separation between the Lord and His
pleasure potency the spiritual bliss of the Lord increases. This is further
explained in Bhagavad-gétä (9.11):
avajänanti mäà müòhä
mänuñéà tanum äçritam
paraà bhävam ajänanto
mama bhüta-maheçvaram
One who does not know the spiritual potency of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead thinks of the Lord as an ordinary human being. But the Lord's mind,
intelligence and senses can never be affected by material conditions. This fact
is further explained in the Skanda Puräëa, as quoted by Madhväcärya:
nitya-pürëa-sukha-jïänasvarüpo
'sau yato vibhuù
ato 'sya räma ity äkhyä

It was actually impossible for Rävaëa to take away Sétä. The form of Sétä taken
by Rävaëa was an illusory representation of mother Sétä—maya-sétä. When
Sétä was tested in the fire, this mäyä-sétä was burnt, and the real Sétä came out
of the fire.
A further understanding to be derived from this example is that a woman,
however powerful she may be in the material world, must be given protection,
for as soon as she is unprotected she will be exploited by Räkñasas like Rävaëa.
Here the words vaideha-räja-duhitari indicate that before mother Sétä was
married to Lord Rämacandra she was protected by her father, Vaideha-räja.
And when she was married she was protected by her husband. Therefore the
conclusion is that a woman should always be protected. According to the
Vedic rule, there is no scope for a woman's being independent (asamakñam),
for a woman cannot protect herself independently.

Lord Rämacandra, whose lotus feet are worshiped by Lord Brahmä and Lord

ceremony of Jaöäyu, who was killed by Rävaëa. The Lord then killed the demon
named Kabandha, and after making friends with the monkey chiefs, killing Väli
and arranging for the deliverance of mother Sétä, He went to the beach of the

O all-pervading Supreme Person, we are dull-minded and did not understand
who You are, but now we understand that You are the Supreme Person, the
master of the entire universe, the unchanging and original Personality of
Godhead. The demigods are infatuated with the mode of goodness, the
Prajäpatis with the mode of passion, and the lord of ghosts with the mode of
ignorance, but You are the master of all these qualities.
PURPORT
The word jaòa-dhiyaù refers to intelligence like that of an animal. A person
with such intelligence cannot understand the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Without being beaten, an animal cannot understand the purpose of
a man. Similarly, those who are dull-minded cannot understand the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, but when punished severely by the modes of material
nature, they begin to understand Him. A Hindi poet has said:
duùkha se saba hari bhaje
sukha se bhaje koé
sukha se agar hari bhaje
duùkha käthäì se haya
When one is distressed he goes to the church or temple to worship the Lord,
but when opulent he forgets the Lord. Therefore, punishment by the Lord
through material nature is necessary in human society, for without it men
forget the supremacy of the Lord due to their dull, blunt intelligence.

TRANSLATION
My Lord, You may use my water as You like. Indeed, You may cross it and
go to the abode of Rävaëa, who is the great source of disturbance and crying for
the three worlds. He is the son of Viçravä, but is condemned like urine. Please
go kill him and thus regain Your wife, Sétädevé. O great hero, although my
water presents no impediment to Your going to Laìkä, please construct a bridge
over it to spread Your transcendental fame. Upon seeing this wonderfully
uncommon deed of Your Lordship, all the great heroes and kings in the future
will glorify You.

PURPORT
It is said that a son and urine emanate from the same source—the genitals.
When a son is a devotee or a great learned person, the seminal discharge for
begetting a son is successful, but if the son is unqualified and brings no glory to
his family, he is no better than urine. Here Rävaëa is compared to urine
because he was a cause of disturbances to the three worlds. Thus the ocean
personified wanted him killed by Lord Rämacandra.
One feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Rämacandra is
omnipotence. The Lord can act without regard to material impediments or
inconveniences, but to prove that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead
and was not merely advertised as Godhead or elected by popular vote, He
constructed a wonderful bridge over the ocean. Nowadays it has become
fashionable to create some artificial God who performs no uncommon
activities; a little magic will bewilder a foolish person into selecting an
artificial God because he does not understand how powerful God is. Lord
Rämacandra, however, constructed a bridge over the water with stone by
making the stone float. This is proof of God's uncommonly wonderful power.
Why should someone be accepted as God without displaying extraordinary
potency by doing something never to be done by any common man? We accept
Lord Rämacandra as the Supreme Personality of Godhead because He
constructed this bridge, and we accept Lord Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality
of Godhead because He lifted Govardhana Hill when He was only seven years
old. We should not accept any rascal as God or an incarnation of God, for God
displays special features in His various activities. Therefore, the Lord Himself
says in Bhagavad-gétä (4.9):
janma karma ca me divyam
evaà yo vetti tattvataù
tyaktvä dehaà punar janma
naiti mäm eti so 'rjuna

"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities
does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but
attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna." The activities of the Lord are not
common; they are all transcendentally wonderful and not able to be performed
by any other living being. The symptoms of the Lord's activities are all
mentioned in the çästras, and after one understands them one can accept the
Lord as He is.

TRANSLATION
Çukadeva Gosvämé said: After constructing a bridge over the ocean by
throwing into the water the peaks of mountains whose trees and other
vegetation had been shaken by the hands of great monkeys, Lord Rämacandra
went to Laìkä to release Sétädevé from the clutches of Rävaëa. With the
direction and help of Vibhéñaëa, Rävaëa's brother, the Lord, along with the
monkey soldiers, headed by Sugréva, Néla and Hanumän, entered Rävaëa's
kingdom, Laìkä, which had previously been burnt by Hanumän.
PURPORT
Great mountain peaks covered with trees and plants were thrown into the
sea by the monkey soldiers and began to float by the supreme will of the Lord.
By the supreme will of the Lord, many great planets float weightlessly in space
like swabs of cotton. If this is possible, why should great mountain peaks not be
able to float on water? This is the omnipotence of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. He can do anything and everything He likes, because He is not
under the control of the material nature; indeed, material nature is controlled
by Him. Mayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù süyate sacaräcaram: [Bg. 9.10] only under His
direction does prakåti, or material nature, work. Similar information is given in
the Brahma-saàhitä (5.52):
yasyäjïayä bhramati sambhåta-käla-cakro
govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi
Describing how material nature works, the Brahma-saàhitä says that the sun
moves as desired by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Consequently, for
Lord Rämacandra to construct a bridge over the Indian Ocean with the help
of monkey soldiers who threw great mountain peaks into the water is not at all

TRANSLATION
Aìgada and the other commanders of the soldiers of Rämacandra faced the
elephants, infantry, horses and chariots of the enemy and hurled against them
big trees, mountain peaks, clubs and arrows. Thus the soldiers of Lord
Rämacandra killed Rävaëa's soldiers, who had lost all good fortune because
Rävaëa had been condemned by the anger of mother Sétä.
PURPORT
The soldiers Lord Rämacandra recruited in the jungle were all monkeys and
did not have proper equipment with which to fight the soldiers of Rävaëa, for
Rävaëa's soldiers were equipped with weapons of modern warfare whereas the
monkeys could only throw stones, mountain peaks and trees. It was only Lord
Rämacandra and Lakñmaëa who shot some arrows. But because the soldiers of
Rävaëa were condemned by the curse of mother Sétä, the monkeys were able
to kill them simply by throwing stones and trees. There are two kinds of
strength—daiva and puruñäkära. Daiva refers to the strength achieved from
the Transcendence, and puruñäkära refers to the strength organized by one's
own intelligence and power. Transcendental power is always superior to the
power of the materialist. Depending on the mercy of the Supreme Lord, one
must fight one's enemies even though one may not be equipped with modern
weapons. Therefore Kåñëa instructed Arjuna, mäm anusmara yudhya ca: [Bg.
8.7] "Think of Me and fight." We should fight our enemy to the best of our
ability, but for victory we must depend on the mercy of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.

Lord Rämacandra said to Rävaëa: You are the most abominable of the
man-eaters. Indeed, you are like their stool. You resemble a dog, for as a dog
steals eatables from the kitchen in the absence of the householder, in My
absence you kidnapped My wife, Sétädevé. Therefore as Yamaräja punishes
sinful men, I shall also punish you. You are most abominable, sinful and
shameless. Today, therefore, I, whose attempt never fails, shall punish you.

PURPORT
Na ca daivät paraà balam: no one can surpass the strength of the
Transcendence. Rävaëa was so sinful and shameless that he did not know
what the result would be of kidnapping mother Sétä, the pleasure potency of
Rämacandra. This is the disqualification of the Räkñasas. Asatyam apratiñöhaà
te jagad ähur anéçvaram [Bg. 16.8]. The Räkñasas are unaware that the Supreme
Lord is the ruler of the creation. They think that everything has come about
by chance or accident and that there is no ruler, king or controller. Therefore
the Räkñasas act independently, as they like, going even so far as to kidnap the
goddess of fortune. This policy of Rävaëa's is extremely dangerous for the
materialist; indeed, it brings ruin to the materialistic civilization. Nonetheless,
because atheists are Räkñasas, they dare to do things that are most abominable,
and thus they are punished without fail. Religion consists of the orders of the
Supreme Lord, and one who carries out these orders is religious. One who fails
to carry out the Lord's orders is irreligious, and he is to be punished.

After thus rebuking Rävaëa, Lord Rämacandra fixed an arrow to His bow,
aimed at Rävaëa, and released the arrow, which pierced Rävaëa's heart like a
thunderbolt. Upon seeing this, Rävaëa's followers raised a tumultuous sound,
crying, "Alas! Alas! What has happened? What has happened?" as Rävaëa,
vomiting blood from his ten mouths, fell from his airplane, just as a pious man
falls to earth from the heavenly planets when the results of his pious activities
are exhausted.
PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gétä (9.21) it is said, kñéëe puëye martya-lokaà viçanti: "When
the results of their pious activities are exhausted, those who have enjoyed in
the heavenly planets fall again to earth." The fruitive activities of this material
world are such that whether one acts piously or impiously one must remain
within the material world according to different conditions, for neither pious
nor impious actions can relieve one from mäyä's clutches of repeated birth and
death. Somehow or other, Rävaëa was raised to an exalted position as the king
of a great kingdom with all material opulences, but because of his sinful act of
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
406
kidnapping mother Sétä, all the results of his pious activities were destroyed. If
one offends an exalted personality, especially the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, one certainly becomes most abominable; bereft of the results of pious
activities, one must fall down like Rävaëa and other demons. It is therefore
advised that one transcend both pious and impious activities and remain in the
pure state of freedom from all designations (sarvopädhi-vinirmuktaà
tat-paratvena nirmalam [Cc. Madhya 19.170]). When one is fixed in devotional
service, he is above the material platform. On the material platform there are
higher and lower positions, but when one is above the material platform he is
always fixed in a spiritual position (sa guëän samatétyaitän brahma-bhüyäya
kalpate [Bg. 14.26]). Rävaëa or those like him may be very powerful and
opulent in this material world, but theirs is not a secure position, because, after
all, they are bound by the results of their karma (karmaëä daiva-netreëa [SB
3.31.1]). We should not forget that we are completely dependent on the laws of
nature.

"The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material

like Rävaëa, thinking oneself independent of material nature's laws.

by Mandodaré, the wife of Rävaëa, came out of Laìkä. Continuously crying,
they approached the dead bodies of Rävaëa and the other Räkñasas.

O my lord, O master! You epitomized trouble for others, and therefore you
were called Rävaëa. But now that you have been defeated, we also are defeated,
for without you the state of Laìkä has been conquered by the enemy. To whom
will it go for shelter?
PURPORT
Rävaëa's wife Mandodaré and the other wives knew very well how cruel a
person Rävaëa was. The very word "Rävaëa" means "one who causes crying for
others." Rävaëa continuously caused trouble for others, but when his sinful
activities culminated in giving trouble to Sétädevé, he was killed by Lord
Rämacandra.

TRANSLATION
O greatly fortunate one, you came under the influence of lusty desires, and
therefore you could not understand the influence of mother Sétä. Now, because
of her curse, you have been reduced to this state, having been killed by Lord
Rämacandra.
PURPORT
Not only was mother Sétä powerful, but any woman who follows in the
footsteps of mother Sétä can also become similarly powerful. There are many
instances of this in the history of Vedic literature. Whenever we find a
description of ideal chaste women, mother Sétä is among them. Mandodaré, the
wife of Rävaëa, was also very chaste. Similarly, Draupadé was one of five
exalted chaste women. As a man must follow great personalities like Brahmä
and Närada, a woman must follow the path of such ideal women as Sétä,
Mandodaré and Draupadé. By staying chaste and faithful to her husband, a
woman enriches herself with supernatural power. It is a moral principle that
one should not be influenced by lusty desires for another's wife. Mätåvat
para-däreñu: an intelligent person must look upon another's wife as being like
his mother. This is a moral injunction from Cäëakya-çloka (10).
mätåvat para-däreñu
para-dravyeñu loñöravat
ätmavat sarva-bhüteñu
yaù paçyati sa paëòitaù
"One who considers another's wife as his mother, another's possessions as a
lump of dirt and treats all other living beings as he would himself, is considered
to be learned." Thus Rävaëa was condemned not only by Lord Rämacandra but
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
411
even by his own wife, Mandodaré. Because she was a chaste woman, she knew
the power of another chaste woman, especially such a wife as mother Sétädevé.

O pleasure of the Räkñasa dynasty, because of you the state of Laìkä and
also we ourselves now have no protector. By your deeds you have made your
body fit to be eaten by vultures and your soul fit to go to hell.
PURPORT
One who follows the path of Rävaëa is condemned in two ways: his body is
fit to be eaten by dogs and vultures, and the soul goes to hell. As stated by the
Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gétä (16.19):

412
tän ahaà dviñataù krürän

äsuréñv eva yoniñu
"Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are
cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species
of life." Thus the destination of godless atheists such as Rävaëa,
Hiraëyakaçipu, Kaàsa and Dantavakra is a hellish condition of life.
Mandodaré, the wife of Rävaëa, could understand all this because she was a
chaste woman. Although lamenting for the death of her husband, she knew
what would happen to his body and soul, for although one cannot see directly
with one's material eyes, one can see with eyes of knowledge (paçyanti
jïäna-cakñuñaù). In Vedic history there are many instances of how one
becomes godless and is condemned by the laws of nature.

member; yat uktam—which have been prescribed; sämparäyikam—duties to be
performed after a person's death to save him from the path to hell.
TRANSLATION
Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé said: Vibhéñaëa, the pious brother of Rävaëa and
devotee of Lord Rämacandra, received approval from Lord Rämacandra, the
King of Kosala. Then he performed the prescribed funeral ceremonies for his
family members to save them from the path to hell.
PURPORT
After giving up the body, one is transferred to another body, but sometimes,
if one is too sinful, he is checked from transmigrating to another body, and
thus he becomes a ghost. To save a diseased person from ghostly life, the
funeral ceremony, or çräddha ceremony, as prescribed in authorized çästra,
must be performed. Rävaëa was killed by Lord Rämacandra and was destined
for hellish life, but by Lord Rämacandra's advice, Vibhéñaëa, Rävaëa's brother,
performed all the duties prescribed in relation to the dead. Thus Lord
Rämacandra was kind to Rävaëa even after Rävaëa's death.

TRANSLATION
Being pleased by the full surrender and submission of Lord Bharata, Lord
Rämacandra then accepted the throne of the state. He cared for the citizens
exactly like a father, and the citizens, being fully engaged in their occupational
duties of varëa and äçrama, accepted Him as their father.
PURPORT
People are very fond of the pattern of Räma-räjya, and even today
politicians sometimes form a party called Räma-räjya, but unfortunately they
have no obedience to Lord Räma. It is sometimes said that people want the
kingdom of God without God. Such an aspiration, however, is never to be
fulfilled. Good government can exist when the relationship between the
citizens and the government is like that exemplified by Lord Rämacandra and
His citizens. Lord Rämacandra ruled His kingdom exactly as a father takes care
of his children, and the citizens, being obliged to the good government of Lord
Rämacandra, accepted the Lord as their father. Thus the relationship between
the citizens and the government should be exactly like that between father
and son. When the sons in a family are well trained, they are obedient to the
father and mother, and when the father is well qualified, he takes good care of
the children. As indicated here by the words sva-dharma-niratä
varëäçrama-guëän-vitäù, the people were good citizens because they accepted
the institution of varëa and äçrama, which arranges society in the varëa
divisions of brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra and the äçrama divisions of
brahmacarya, gåhastha, vänaprastha and sannyäsa. This is actual human
civilization. People must be trained according to the different varëäçrama
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
430
occupational duties. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä (4.13), cätur-varëyaà mayä
såñöaà guëa-karma-vibhägaçaù: the four varëas must be established according
to varying qualities and work. The first principle for good government is that
it must institute this varëäçrama system. The purpose of varëäçrama is to
enable people to become God conscious. Varëäçramäcäravatä puruñeëa paraù
pumän viñëur ärädhyate [Cc. Madhya 8.58]. The entire varëäçrama scheme is
intended to enable people to become Vaiñëavas. Viñëur asya devatä. When
people worship Lord Viñëu as the Supreme Lord, they become Vaiñëavas. Thus
people should be trained to become Vaiñëavas through the system of varëa and
äçrama, as they were during the reign of Lord Rämacandra, when everyone
was fully trained to follow the varëäçrama principles.
Simply enforcing laws and ordinances cannot make the citizens obedient
and lawful. That is impossible. Throughout the entire world there are so many
states, legislative assemblies and parliaments, but still the citizens are rogues
and thieves. Good citizenship, therefore, cannot be enforced; the citizens must
be trained. As there are schools and colleges to train students to become
chemical engineers, lawyers or specialists in many other departments of
knowledge, there must be schools and colleges to train students to become
brähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas, çüdras, brahmacärés, gåhasthas, vänaprasthas and
sannyäsés. This will provide the preliminary condition for good citizenship
(varëäçrama-guëän-vitäù). Generally speaking, if the king or president is a
räjarñi, the relationship between the citizens and the chief executive will be
clear, and there will be no possibility of disruption in the state, because the
number of thieves and rogues will decrease. In Kali-yuga, however, because the
varëäçrama system is neglected, people are generally thieves and rogues. In the
system of democracy, such thieves and rogues naturally collect money from
other thieves and rogues, and thus there is chaos in every government, and no
one is happy. But here the example of good government is to be found in the
reign of Lord Rämacandra. If people follow this example, there will be good
government all over the world.

Hare Kåñëa, Hare Räma, they will certainly be freed from the contamination
of Kali-yuga, and the people of this age will be happy, as people were in
Satya-yuga, the golden age. Anyone, anywhere, can easily take to this Hare
Kåñëa movement; one need only chant the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra, observe
the rules and regulations, and stay free from the contamination of sinful life.
Even if one is sinful and cannot give up sinful life immediately, if he chants
the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra with devotion and faith he will certainly be
freed from all sinful activities, and his life will be successful. Paraà vijayate

When Lord Rämacandra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was the King
of this world, all bodily and mental suffering, disease, old age, bereavement,
lamentation, distress, fear and fatigue were completely absent. There was even
no death for those who did not want it.
PURPORT
All these facilities existed because of Lord Rämacandra's presence as the
King of the entire world. A similar situation could be introduced immediately,
even in this age called Kali, the worst of all ages. It is said, kali-käle näma-rüpe
kåñëa-avatära: Kåñëa descends in this Kali-yuga in the form of His holy
name—Hare Kåñëa, Hare Räma. If we chant offenselessly, Räma and Kåñëa
are still present in this age. The kingdom of Räma was immensely popular and
beneficial, and the spreading of this Hare Kåñëa movement can immediately
introduce a similar situation, even in this Kali-yuga.

Lord Rämacandra took a vow to accept only one wife and have no
connection with any other women. He was a saintly king, and everything in His
character was good, untinged by qualities like anger. He taught good behavior
for everyone, especially for householders, in terms of varëäçrama-dharma. Thus
He taught the general public by His personal activities.
PURPORT
Eka-patné-vrata, accepting only one wife, was the glorious example set by
Lord Rämacandra. One should not accept more than one wife. In those days,
of course, people did marry more than one wife. Even Lord Rämacandra's
father accepted more wives than one. But Lord Rämacandra, as an ideal king,
accepted only one wife, mother Sétä. When mother Sétä was kidnapped by
Rävaëa and the Räkñasas, Lord Rämacandra, as the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, could have married hundreds and thousands of Sétäs, but to teach us
how faithful He was to His wife, He fought with Rävaëa and finally killed him.
The Lord punished Rävaëa and rescued His wife to instruct men to have only
one wife. Lord Rämacandra accepted only one wife and manifested sublime
character, thus setting an example for householders. A householder should live
according to the ideal of Lord Rämacandra, who showed how to be a perfect

person. Being a householder or living with a wife and children is never
condemned, provided one lives according to the regulative principles of
varëäçrama-dharma. Those who live in accordance with these principles,
whether as householders, brahmacärés or vänaprasthas, are all equally
important.

437
PURPORT
As Lord Rämacandra is the ideal husband (eka-patné-vrata), mother Sétä is
the ideal wife. Such a combination makes family life very happy. Yad yad
äcarati çreñöhas tat tad evetaro janaù: whatever example a great man sets,
common people follow. If the kings, the leaders, and the brähmaëas, the
teachers, would set forth the examples we receive from Vedic literature, the
entire world would be heaven; indeed, there would no longer be hellish
conditions within this material world.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Tenth Chapter, of the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Pastimes of the Supreme Lord, Rämacandra."
11. Lord Rämacandra Rules the World
This chapter describes how Lord Rämacandra resided in Ayodhyä with His
younger brothers and performed various sacrifices.
Lord Rämacandra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, performed various
sacrifices by which to worship Himself, and at the end of these sacrifices He
gave land to the hotä, adhvaryu, udgätä and brahmä priests. He gave them the
eastern, western, northern and southern directions respectively, and the
balance He gave to the äcärya. Lord Rämacandra's faith in the brähmaëas and
affection for His servants was observed by all the brähmaëas, who then offered
their prayers to the Lord and returned whatever they had taken from Him.
They regarded the enlightenment given to them by the Lord within the core
of their hearts as a sufficient contribution. Lord Rämacandra subsequently
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
438
dressed Himself like an ordinary person and began wandering within the
capital to understand what impression the citizens had of Him. By chance, one
night He heard a man talking to his wife, who had gone to another man's
house. In the course of rebuking his wife, the man spoke suspiciously of the
character of Sétädevé. The Lord immediately returned home, and, fearing such
rumors, He superficially decided to give up Sétädevé's company. Thus He
banished Sétädevé, who was pregnant, to the shelter of Välméki Muni, where
she gave birth to twin sons, named Lava and Kuça. In Ayodhyä, Lakñmaëa
begot two sons named Aìgada and Citraketu, Bharata begot two sons named
Takña and Puñkala, and Çatrughna begot two sons named Subähu and
Çrutasena. When Bharata went out to conquer various lands on behalf of the
emperor, Lord Rämacandra, He fought many millions of Gandharvas. By
killing them in the fight, He acquired immense wealth, which He then brought
home. Çatrughna killed a demon named Lavaëa at Madhuvana and thus
established the capital of Mathurä. Meanwhile, Sétädevé placed her two sons in
the care of Välméki Muni and then entered into the earth. Upon hearing of
this, Lord Rämacandra was very much aggrieved, and thus He performed
sacrifices for thirteen thousand years. After describing the pastimes of Lord
Rämacandra's disappearance and establishing that the Lord appears for His
pastimes only, Çukadeva Gosvämé ends this chapter by describing the results of
hearing about the activities of Lord Rämacandra and by describing how the
Lord protected His citizens and displayed affection for His brothers.

and leaves, and as supplying food to the stomach enlivens the senses and limbs
of the body, worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead satisfies the
demigods, who are part of that Supreme Personality." Performing yajïa
involves worshiping the Supreme Lord. Here the Supreme Lord worshiped the
Supreme Lord. Therefore it is said, bhagavän ätmanätmänam éje: the Lord
worshiped Himself by Himself. This does not, of course, justify the Mäyäväda
philosophy, by which one thinks himself the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
The jéva, the living entity, is always different from the Supreme Lord. The
living entities (vibhinnäàça) never become one with the Lord, although
Mäyävädés sometimes imitate the Lord's worship of Himself. Lord Kåñëa
meditated upon Himself every morning as a gåhastha, and similarly Lord
Rämacandra performed yajïas to satisfy Himself, but this does not mean that
an ordinary living being should imitate the Lord by accepting the process of
ahaìgraha-upäsanä. Such unauthorized worship is not recommended herein.

All the brähmaëas who were engaged in the various activities of the sacrifice
were very pleased with Lord Rämacandra, who was greatly affectionate and
favorable to the brähmaëas. Thus with melted hearts they returned all the
property received from Him and spoke as follows.
PURPORT
In the previous chapter it was said that the prajäs, the citizens, strictly
followed the system of varëäçrama-dharma. The brähmaëas acted exactly like
brähmaëas, the kñatriyas exactly like kñatriyas, and so on. Therefore, when
Lord Rämacandra gave everything in charity to the brähmaëas, the brähmaëas,
being qualified, wisely considered that brähmaëas are not meant to possess
property to make a profit from it. The qualifications of a brähmaëa are given
in Bhagavad-gétä (18.42):

444
çamo damas tapaù çaucaà
kñäntir ärjavam eva ca
jïänaà vijïänam ästikyaà
brahma-karma svabhävajam
"Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, wisdom,
knowledge, and religiousness—these are the qualities by which the brähmaëas
work." The brahminical character offers no scope for possessing land and
ruling citizens; these are the duties of a kñatriya. Therefore, although the
brähmaëas did not refuse Lord Rämacandra's gift, after accepting it they
returned it to the King. The brähmaëas were so pleased with Lord
Rämacandra's affection toward them that their hearts melted. They saw that
Lord Rämacandra, aside from being the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was
fully qualified as a kñatriya and was exemplary in character. One of the
qualifications of a kñatriya is to be charitable. A kñatriya, or ruler, levies taxes
upon the citizens not for his personal sense gratification but to give charity in
suitable cases. Dänam éçvara-bhävaù. On one hand, kñatriyas have the
propensity to rule, but on the other they are very liberal with charity. When
Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira gave charity, he engaged Karëa to take charge of
distributing it. Karëa was very famous as Dätä Karëa. The word dätä refers to
one who gives charity very liberally. The kings always kept a large quantity of
food grains in stock, and whenever there was any scarcity of grains, they would
distribute grains in charity. A kñatriya's duty is to give charity, and a
brähmaëa's duty is to accept charity, but not more than needed to maintain
body and soul together. Therefore, when the brähmaëas were given so much
land by Lord Rämacandra, they returned it to Him and were not greedy.

PURPORT
When Dhruva Mahäräja was offered a benediction by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, he replied, "O my Lord, I am fully satisfied. I do not
need any material benediction." Similarly, when Prahläda Mahäräja was
offered a benediction by Lord Nåsiàhadeva, he also refused to accept it and
instead declared that a devotee should not be like a vaëik, a mercantile man
who gives something in exchange for some profit. One who becomes a devotee
for some material profit is not a pure devotee. Brähmaëas are always
enlightened by the Supreme Personality of Godhead within the heart

446
(sarvasya cähaà hådi sanniviñöo mattaù småtir jïänam apohanaà ca [Bg. 15.15]).
And because the brähmaëas and Vaiñëavas are always directed by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, they are not greedy for material wealth. What is
absolutely necessary they possess, but they do not want an expanded kingdom.
An example of this was given by Vämanadeva. Acting as a brahmacäré, Lord
Vämanadeva wanted only three paces of land. Aspiring to possess more and
more for personal sense gratification is simply ignorance, and this ignorance is
conspicuous by its absence from the heart of a brähmaëa or Vaiñëava.

Lord Rämacandra's grief at the news of Sétädevé's entering the earth is not

separation, but such feelings are considered spiritual bliss. Grief in separation
exists even in the Absolute, but such feelings of separation in the spiritual
world are transcendentally blissful. Such feelings are a sign of tasya
prema-vaçyatva-svabhäva, being under the influence of hlädiné-çakti and being
controlled by love. In the material world such feelings of separation are only a
perverted reflection.

The attraction between man and woman, or male and female, always exists

As explained above, when the feelings of love and transcendental bliss from
the spiritual world are pervertedly reflected in this material world, they are
certainly the cause of bondage. As long as men feel attracted to women in this
material world and women feel attracted to men, the bondage of repeated birth
and death will continue. But in the spiritual world, where there is no fear of
birth and death, such feelings of separation are the cause of transcendental
bliss. In the absolute reality there are varieties of feeling, but all of them are of
the same quality of transcendental bliss.

After completing the sacrifice, Lord Rämacandra, whose lotus feet were
sometimes pierced by thorns when He lived in Daëòakäraëya, placed those
lotus feet in the hearts of those who always think of Him. Then He entered His
own abode, the Vaikuëöha planet beyond the brahmajyoti.
PURPORT
The lotus feet of the Lord are always a subject matter for meditation for
devotees. Sometimes when Lord Rämacandra wandered in the forest of
Daëòakäraëya, thorns pricked His lotus feet. The devotees, upon thinking of
this, would faint. The Lord does not feel pain or pleasure from any action or
reaction of this material world, but the devotees cannot tolerate even the
pricking of the Lord's lotus feet by a thorn. This was the attitude of the gopés
when they thought of Kåñëa wandering in the forest, with pebbles and grains
of sand pricking His lotus feet. This tribulation in the heart of a devotee
cannot be understood by karmés, jïänés or yogés. The devotees, who could not
tolerate even thinking of the Lord's lotus feet being pricked by a thorn, were
again put into tribulation by thinking of the Lord's disappearance, for the Lord
had to return to His abode after finishing His pastimes in this material world.
The word ätma-jyotiù is significant. The brahmajyoti, which is greatly
appreciated by jïänés, or monistic philosophers who desire to enter it for
liberation, is nothing but the rays of the Lord's body.

"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is endowed with great power. The
glowing effulgence of His transcendental form is the impersonal Brahman,
which is absolute, complete and unlimited and which displays the varieties of
countless planets, with their different opulences, in millions and millions of
universes." (Bs. 5.40) The brahmajyoti is the beginning of the spiritual world,
and beyond the brahmajyoti are the Vaikuëöha planets. In other words, the
brahmajyoti stays outside the Vaikuëöha planets, just as the sunshine stays
outside the sun. To enter the sun planet, one must go through the sunshine.
Similarly, when the Lord or His devotees enter the Vaikuëöha planets, they go
through the brahmajyoti. The jïänés, or monistic philosophers, because of their
impersonal conception of the Lord, cannot enter the Vaikuëöha planets, but
they also cannot stay eternally in the brahmajyoti. Thus after some time they
fall again to this material world. Äruhya kåcchreëa paraà padaà tataù patanty
adho 'nädåta-yuñmad-aìghrayaù (SB 10.2.32). The Vaikuëöha planets are
covered by the brahmajyoti, and therefore one cannot properly understand
what those Vaikuëöha planets are unless one is a pure devotee.

TRANSLATION
Lord Rämacandra's reputation for having killed Rävaëa with showers of
arrows at the request of the demigods and for having built a bridge over the
ocean does not constitute the factual glory of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead Lord Rämacandra, whose spiritual body is always engaged in various
pastimes. Lord Rämacandra has no equal or superior, and therefore He had no
need to take help from the monkeys to gain victory over Rävaëa.

greater than Him, for everything is done naturally and systematically by His
multifarious energies." The Lord has nothing to do (na tasya käryaà karaëaà
ca vidyate); whatever He does is His pastime. The Lord has no duty to perform
to oblige anyone. Nonetheless, He appears to act to protect His devotees or kill
His enemies. Of course, no one can be the Lord's enemy, since who could be
more powerful than the Lord? There is actually no question of anyone's being
His enemy, but when the Lord wants to take pleasure in pastimes, He comes
down to this material world and acts like a human being, thus showing His
wonderful, glorious activities to please the devotees. His devotees always want
to see the Lord victorious in varied activities, and therefore, to please Himself
and them, the Lord sometimes agrees to act as a human being and perform
wonderful, uncommon pastimes for the satisfaction of the devotees.

Lord Rämacandra returned to His abode, to which bhakti-yogés are
promoted. This is the place to which all the inhabitants of Ayodhyä went after
they served the Lord in His manifest pastimes by offering Him obeisances,
touching His lotus feet, fully observing Him as a fatherlike King, sitting or
lying down with Him like equals, or even just accompanying Him.
PURPORT
The Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä (4.9):
janma karma ca me divyam
evaà yo vetti tattvataù
tyaktvä dehaà punar janma
naiti mäm eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities
does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but
attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna." Here this is confirmed. All the
inhabitants of Ayodhyä who saw Lord Rämacandra as citizens, served Him as
servants, sat and talked with Him as friends or were somehow or other present
during His reign went back home, back to Godhead. After giving up the body,
the devotee who becomes perfect in devotional service enters that particular
universe where Lord Rämacandra or Lord Kåñëa is engaged in His pastimes.
Then, after being trained to serve the Lord in various capacities in that
prakaöa-lélä, the devotee is finally promoted to sanätana-dhäma, the supreme
abode in the spiritual world. This sanätana-dhäma is also mentioned in
Bhagavad-gétä (paras tasmät tu bhävo 'nyo 'vyakto 'vyaktät sanätanaù [Bg. 8.20]).

One who enters the transcendental pastimes of the Lord is called
nitya-lélä-praviñöa. To understand clearly why Lord Rämacandra returned, it is
mentioned herewith that the Lord went to that particular place where the
bhakti-yogés go. The impersonalists misunderstand the statements of
Çrémad-Bhägavatam to mean that the Lord entered His own effulgence and
therefore become impersonal. But the Lord is a person, and His devotees are
persons. Indeed, the living entities, like the Lord, were persons in the past,
they are persons in the present, and they will continue to be persons even after
giving up the body. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä.

O King Parékñit, anyone who aurally receives the narrations concerning the
characteristics of Lord Rämacandra's pastimes will ultimately be freed from the
disease of envy and thus be liberated from the bondage of fruitive activities.
PURPORT
Here in this material world, everyone is envious of someone else. Even in
religious life, it is sometimes found that if one devotee has advanced in
spiritual activities, other devotees are envious of him. Such envious devotees
are not completely freed from the bondage of birth and death. As long as one
is not completely free from the cause of birth and death, one cannot enter the
sanätana-dhäma or the eternal pastimes of the Lord. One becomes envious
because of being influenced by the designations of the body, but the liberated
devotee has nothing to do with the body, and therefore he is completely on the
transcendental platform. A devotee is never envious of anyone, even his
enemy. Because the devotee knows that the Lord is his supreme protector, he
thinks, "What harm can the so-called enemy do?" Thus a devotee is confident
about his protection. The Lord says, ye yathä mäà prapadyante täàs tathaiva
bhajämy aham: [Bg. 4.11] "According to the proportion of one's surrender unto
Me, I respond accordingly." A devotee must therefore be completely free from
envy, especially of other devotees. To envy other devotees is a great offense, a
vaiñëava-aparädha. A devotee who constantly engages in hearing and chanting
(çravaëa-kértana) is certainly freed from the disease of envy, and thus he
becomes eligible to go back home, back to Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Çukadeva Gosvämé replied: After accepting the throne of the government by
the fervent request of His younger brother Bharata, Lord Rämacandra ordered
His younger brothers to go out and conquer the entire world, while He
personally remained in the capital to give audience to all the citizens and
residents of the palace and supervise the governmental affairs with His other
assistants.
PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead does not allow any of His devotees or
assistants to be engaged in sense gratification. The younger brothers of Lord
Rämacandra were at home enjoying the personal presence of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, but the Lord ordered Them to go out and achieve
victory all over the world. It was the custom (and this custom, in some places,
is still current) that all other kings would have to accept the supremacy of the
emperor. If the king of a small state did not accept the emperor's supremacy,
there would be a fight, and the king of the small state would be obliged to
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
467
accept the emperor as supreme; otherwise, it would not be possible for the
emperor to rule the country.
Lord Rämacandra showed His favor to His brothers by ordering Them to go
out. Many of the Lord's devotees residing in Våndävana have taken the vow
not to leave Våndävana to preach Kåñëa consciousness. But the Lord says that
Kåñëa consciousness should be spread all over the world, in every village and
every town. This is the open order of Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu.
påthivéte äche yata nagarädi gräma
sarvatra pracära haibe mora näma
A pure devotee, therefore, must execute the order of the Lord and must not
gratify his senses by remaining stagnant in one place, falsely proud, thinking
that because he does not leave Våndävana but chants in a solitary place he has
become a great devotee. A devotee must carry out the order of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Caitanya Mahäprabhu said, yäre dekha, täre kaha
'kåñëa'-upadeça [Cc. Madhya 7.128]. Every devotee, therefore, should spread
Kåñëa consciousness by preaching, asking whomever he meets to accept the
order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord says, sarva-dharmän
parityajya mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja: [Bg. 18.66] "Abandon all varieties of
religion and just surrender unto Me." This is the order of the Lord, who speaks
as the supreme emperor. Everyone should be induced to accept this order, for
this is victory (dig-vijaya). And it is the duty of the soldier, the devotee, to
impress upon everyone this philosophy of life.
Of course, those who are kaniñöha-adhikärés do not preach, but the Lord
shows mercy to them also, as He did by staying personally in Ayodhyä to give
audience to the people in general. One should not mistakenly think that the
Lord asked His younger brothers to leave Ayodhyä because He especially
favored the citizens. The Lord is merciful to everyone, and He knows how to
show His favor to each individual person according to his capacity. One who
abides by the order of the Lord is a pure devotee.

During the reign of Lord Rämacandra, the streets of the capital, Ayodhyä,
were sprinkled with perfumed water and drops of perfumed liquor, thrown
about by elephants from their trunks. When the citizens saw the Lord
personally supervising the affairs of the city in such opulence, they appreciated
this opulence very much.
PURPORT
We have simply heard about the opulence of Räma-räjya during the reign of
Lord Rämacandra. Now, here is one example of the opulence of the Lord's
kingdom. The streets of Ayodhyä were not only cleaned but also sprinkled
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
469
with perfumed water and drops of perfumed liquor, which were distributed by
elephants through their trunks. There was no need of sprinkling machines, for
the elephant has a natural ability to suck water through its trunk and again
throw it out in a shower. We can understand the opulence of the city from this
one example: it was actually sprinkled with perfumed water. Moreover, the
citizens had the opportunity to see the Lord personally supervising the affairs
of the state. He was not a sleeping monarch, as we can understand from His
activities in sending His brothers to see to affairs outside the capital and
punish anyone who did not obey the emperor's orders. This is called dig-vijaya.
The citizens were all given facilities for peaceful life, and they were also
qualified with appropriate attributes according to varëäçrama. As we have seen
from the previous chapter, varëäçrama-guëänvitäù: the citizens were trained
according to the varëäçrama system. A class of men were brähmaëas, a class of
men were kñatriyas, a class were vaiçyas, and a class were çüdras. Without this
scientific division, there can be no question of good citizenship. The King,
being magnanimous and perfect in His duty, performed many sacrifices and
treated the citizens as His sons, and the citizens, being trained in the
varëäçrama system, were obedient and perfectly ordered. The entire monarchy
was so opulent and peaceful that the government was even able to sprinkle the
street with perfumed water, what to speak of other management. Since the city
was sprinkled with perfumed water, we can simply imagine how opulent it was
in other respects. Why should the citizens not have felt happy during the reign
of Lord Rämacandra.

12. The Dynasty of Kuça, the Son of Lord Rämacandra
This chapter describes the dynasty of Kuça, the son of Lord Rämacandra.
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
477
The members of this dynasty are descendants of Saçäda, the son of Mahäräja
Ikñväku.
Following in the genealogical table of Lord Rämacandra's dynasty, Kuça, the
Lord's son, was followed consecutively by Atithi, Niñadha, Nabha, Puëòaréka,
Kñemadhanvä, Devänéka, Anéha, Päriyätra, Balasthala, Vajranäbha, Sagaëa
and Vidhåti. These personalities ruled the world. From Vidhåti came
Hiraëyanäbha, who later became the disciple of Jaimini and propounded the
system of mystic yoga in which Yäjïavalkya was initiated. Following in this
dynasty were Puñpa, Dhruvasandhi, Sudarçana, Agnivarëa, Çéghra and Maru.
Maru attained full perfection in the practice of yoga, and he still lives in the
village of Kaläpa. At the end of this age of Kali, he will revive the dynasty of
the sun-god. Next in the dynasty were Prasuçruta, Sandhi, Amarñaëa,
Mahasvän, Viçvabähu, Prasenajit, Takñaka and Båhadbala, who was later killed
by Abhimanyu. Çukadeva Gosvämé said that these were all kings who had
passed away. The future descendants of Båhadbala will be Båhadraëa,
Ürukriya, Vatsavåddha, Prativyoma, Bhänu, Diväka, Sahadeva, Båhadaçva,
Bhänumän, Pratékäçva, Supratéka, Marudeva, Sunakñatra, Puñkara, Antarikña,
Sutapä, Amitrajit, Båhadräja, Barhi, Kåtaïjaya, Raëaïjaya, Saïjaya, Çäkya,
Çuddhoda, Läìgala, Prasenajit, Kñudraka, Raëaka, Suratha and Sumitra. All of
them will become kings one after another. Sumitra, coming in this age of Kali,
will be the last king in the Ikñväku dynasty; after him, the dynasty will be
extinguished.

TRANSLATION
Having achieved perfection in the power of mystic yoga, Maru still lives in a
place known as Kaläpa-gräma. At the end of Kali-yuga, he will revive the lost
Sürya dynasty by begetting a son.
PURPORT
At least five thousand years ago, Çréla Çukadeva Gosvämé ascertained the
existence of Maru in Kaläpa-gräma and said that Maru, having achieved a
yoga-siddha body, would continue to exist until the end of Kali-yuga, which is
calculated to continue for 432,000 years. Such is the perfection of mystic
power. By controlling the breath, the perfect yogé can continue his life for as
long as he likes. Sometimes we hear from the Vedic literature that some
personalities from the Vedic age, such as Vyäsadeva and Açvatthämä, are still
living. Here we understand that Maru is also still living. We are sometimes
surprised that a mortal body can live for such a long time. The explanation of
this longevity is given here by the word yoga-siddha. If one becomes perfect in
the practice of yoga, he can live as long as he likes. The demonstration of some
trifling yoga-siddha does not constitute perfection. Here is a factual example of
perfection: a yoga-siddha can live as long as he likes.

been the son of Ikñväku.
When Mahäräja Nimi began performing great sacrifices, he appointed
Vasiñöha to be chief priest, but Vasiñöha refused, for he had already agreed to
be priest in performing a yajïa for Lord Indra. Vasiñöha therefore requested
Mahäräja Nimi to wait until Lord Indra's sacrifice was finished, but Mahäräja
Nimi did not wait. He thought, "Life is very short, so there is no need to wait."
He therefore appointed another priest to perform the yajïa. Vasiñöha was very

491
angry at King Nimi and cursed him, saying, "May your body fall down." Cursed
in that way, Mahäräja Nimi also became very angry, and he retaliated by
saying, "May your body also fall down." As a result of this cursing and
countercursing, both of them died. After this incident, Vasiñöha took birth
again, begotten by Mitra and Varuëa, who were agitated by Urvaçé.
The priests who were engaged in the sacrifice for King Nimi preserved
Nimi's body in fragrant chemicals. When the sacrifice was over, the priests
prayed for Nimi's life to all the demigods who had come to the arena of yajïa,
but Mahäräja Nimi refused to take birth again in a material body because he
considered the material body obnoxious. The great sages then churned Nimi's
body, and as a result of this churning, Janaka was born.
The son of Janaka was Udävasu, and the son of Udävasu was
Nandivardhana. The son of Nandivardhana was Suketu, and his descendants
continued as follows: Devaräta, Båhadratha, Mahävérya, Sudhåti, Dhåñöaketu,
Haryaçva, Maru, Pratépaka, Kåtaratha, Devaméòha, Viçruta, Mahädhåti,
Kåtiräta, Mahäromä, Svarëaromä, Hrasvaromä and Çéradhvaja. All these sons
appeared in the dynasty one after another. From Çéradhvaja, mother Sétädevé
was born. Çéradhvaja's son was Kuçadhvaja, and the son of Kuçadhvaja was
Dharmadhvaja. The sons of Dharmadhvaja were Kåtadhvaja and Mitadhvaja.
The son of Kåtadhvaja was Keçidhvaja, and the son of Mitadhvaja was
Khäëòikya. Keçidhvaja was a self-realized soul, and his son was Bhänumän,
whose descendants were as follows: Çatadyumna, Çuci, Sanadväja, Ürjaketu,
Aja, Purujit, Ariñöanemi, Çrutäyu, Supärçvaka, Citraratha, Kñemädhi,
Samaratha, Satyaratha, Upaguru, Upagupta, Vasvananta, Yuyudha,
Subhäñaëa, Çruta, Jaya, Vijaya, Åta, Çunaka, Vétahavya, Dhåti, Bahuläçva, Kåti
and Mahävaçé. All of these sons were great self-controlled personalities. This
completes the list of the entire dynasty.

Mahäräja Nimi, being a self-realized soul, considered that this life is
flickering. Therefore, instead of waiting long for Vasiñöha, he began performing
the sacrifice with other priests.

"The duration of one's life in the material world may end at any moment, but if

fact. In the human form of life one should perform activities in such a way that
at the end he goes back home, back to Godhead. This is self-realization.

After completing the sacrificial performance for King Indra, the spiritual

TRANSLATION
For unnecessarily cursing him when he had committed no offense, Mahäräja
Nimi countercursed his spiritual master. "For the sake of getting contributions
from the King of heaven," he said, "you have lost your religious intelligence.
Therefore I pronounce this curse: your body also will fall."
PURPORT
The religious principle for a brähmaëa is that he should not be greedy at all.
In this case, however, for the sake of more lucrative remunerations from the
King of heaven, Vasiñöha neglected Mahäräja Nimi's request on this planet,
and when Nimi performed the sacrifices with other priests, Vasiñöha
unnecessarily cursed him. When one is infected by contaminated activities, his
power, material or spiritual, reduces. Although Vasiñöha was the spiritual
master of Mahäräja Nimi, because of his greed he became fallen.

After saying this, Mahäräja Nimi, who was expert in the science of spiritual
knowledge, gave up his body. Vasiñöha, the great-grandfather, gave up his body
also, but through the semen discharged by Mitra and Varuëa when they saw
Urvaçé, he was born again.
PURPORT
Mitra and Varuëa chanced to meet Urvaçé, the most beautiful prostitute of
the heavenly kingdom, and they became lusty. Because they were great saints,
they tried to control their lust, but they could not do so, and thus they
discharged semen. This semen was kept carefully in a waterpot, and Vasiñöha
was born from it.

During the performance of the yajïa, the body relinquished by Mahäräja

TRANSLATION
"If you are satisfied with this sacrifice and if you are actually able to do so,
kindly bring Mahäräja Nimi back to life in this body." The demigods said yes to
this request by the sages, but Mahäräja Nimi said, "Please do not imprison me
again in a material body."
PURPORT
The demigods are in a position many times higher than that of human
beings. Therefore, although the great saints and sages were also powerful
brähmaëas, they requested the demigods to revive Mahäräja Nimi's body,
which had been preserved in various perfumed balms. One should not think
that the demigods are powerful only in enjoying the senses; they are also
powerful in such deeds as bringing life back to a dead body. There are many
similar instances in the Vedic literature. For example, according to the history
of Sävitré and Satyavän, Satyavän died and was being taken away by Yamaräja,
but on the request of his wife, Sävitré, Satyavän was revived in the same body.
This is an important fact about the power of the demigods.

TRANSLATION
Mahäräja Nimi continued: Mäyävädés generally want freedom from accepting
a material body because they fear having to give it up again. But devotees whose
intelligence is always filled with the service of the Lord are unafraid. Indeed,
they take advantage of the body to render transcendental loving service.
PURPORT
Mahäräja Nimi did not want to accept a material body, which would be a
cause of bondage; because he was a devotee, he wanted a body by which he
could render devotional service to the Lord. Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura sings:
janmäobi more icchä yadi tora
bhakta-gåhe jani janma ha-u mora
kéöa-janma ha-u yathä tuyä däsa
"My Lord, if You want me to take birth and accept a material body again,
kindly do me this favor: allow me to take birth in the home of Your servant,
Your devotee. I do not mind being born there even as an insignificant creature
like an insect." Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu also said:

kavitäà vä jagadéça kämaye
mama janmani janmanéçvare
bhavatäd bhaktir ahaitukyé tvayi
[Cc. Antya 20.29, Çikñäñöaka 4]
"O Lord of the universe, I do not desire material wealth, materialistic followers,
a beautiful wife or fruitive activities described in flowery language. All I want,
life after life, is unmotivated devotional service to You." (Çikñäñöaka 4) By
saying "life after life" (janmani janmani), the Lord referred not to an ordinary
birth but a birth in which to remember the lotus feet of the Lord. Such a body
is desirable. A devotee does not think like yogés and jïänés, who want to refuse
a material body and become one with the impersonal Brahman effulgence. A
devotee does not like this idea. On the contrary, he will accept any body,
material or spiritual, for he wants to serve the Lord. This is real liberation.
If one has a strong desire to serve the Lord, even if he accepts a material
body, there is no cause of anxiety, since a devotee, even in a material body, is a
liberated soul. This is confirmed by Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé:
éhä yasya harer däsye
karmaëä manasä girä
nikhiläsv apy avasthäsu
jévan-muktaù sa ucyate
"A person acting in Kåñëa consciousness (or, in other words, in the service of
Kåñëa) with his body, mind, intelligence and words is a liberated person even
within the material world, although he may be engaged in many so-called
material activities." The desire to serve the Lord establishes one as liberated in
any condition of life, whether in a spiritual body or a material body. In a
spiritual body the devotee becomes a direct associate of the Lord, but even
though a devotee may superficially appear to be in a material body, he is always
liberated and is engaged in the same duties of service to the Lord as a devotee
in Vaikuëöhaloka. There is no distinction. It is said, sädhur jévo vä maro vä.
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
502
Whether a devotee is alive or dead, his only concern is to serve the Lord.
Tyaktvä dehaà punar janma naiti mäm eti [Bg. 4.9]. When he gives up his body,
he goes directly to become an associate of the Lord and serve Him, although he
does the same thing even in a material body in the material world.
For a devotee there is no pain, pleasure or material perfection. One may
argue that at the time of death a devotee also suffers because of giving up his
material body. But in this connection the example may be given that a cat
carries a mouse in its mouth and also carries a kitten in its mouth. Both the
mouse and the kitten are carried in the same mouth, but the perception of the
mouse is different from that of the kitten. When a devotee gives up his body
(tyaktvä deham), he is ready to go back home, back to Godhead. Thus his
perception is certainly different from that of a person being taken away by
Yamaräja for punishment. A person whose intelligence is always concentrated
upon the service of the Lord is unafraid of accepting a material body, whereas
a nondevotee, having no engagement in the service of the Lord, is very much
afraid of accepting a material body or giving up his present one. Therefore, we
should follow the instruction of Caitanya Mahäprabhu: mama janmani
janmanéçvare bhavatäd bhaktir ahaituké tvayi [Cc. Antya 20.29, Çikñäñöaka 4]. It
doesn't matter whether we accept a material body or a spiritual body; our only
ambition should be to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
I do not wish to accept a material body, for such a body is the source of all
distress, lamentation and fear, everywhere in the universe, just as it is for a fish
in the water, which lives always in anxiety because of fear of death.
PURPORT
The material body, whether in the higher or lower planetary system, is
destined to die. In the lower planetary system or lower species of life one may
die soon, and in the higher planets or higher species one may live for a long,
long time, but death is inevitable. This fact should be understood. In the
human form of life one should take the opportunity to put an end to birth,
death, old age and disease by performing tapasya. This is the aim of human
civilization: to stop the repetition of birth and death, which is called
måtyu-saàsära-vartmani [Bg. 9.3]. This can be done only when one is Kåñëa
conscious, or has achieved the service of the lotus feet of the Lord. Otherwise
one must rot in this material world and accept a material body subject to birth,
death, old age and disease.
The example given here is that water is a very nice place for a fish, but the
fish is never free from anxiety about death, since big fish are always eager to
eat the small fish. phalgüni tatra mahatäm: all living entities are eaten by

bigger living entities. This is the way of material nature.

"Those who are devoid of hands are prey for those who have hands; those
devoid of legs are prey for the four-legged. The weak are the subsistence of the
strong, and the general rule holds that one living being is food for another."
(SB 1.13.47) The Supreme Personality of Godhead has created the material
world in such a way that one living entity is food for another. Thus there is a
struggle for existence, but although we speak of survival of the fittest, no one
can escape death without becoming a devotee of the Lord. Harià vinä naiva
såtià taranti: one cannot escape the cycle of birth and death without becoming
a devotee. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä (9.3). Apräpya mäà
nivartante måtyu-saàsära-vartmani. One who does not attain shelter at the
lotus feet of Kåñëa must certainly wander up and down within the cycle of
birth and death.

TRANSLATION
The demigods said: Let Mahäräja Nimi live without a material body. Let him
live in a spiritual body as a personal associate of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, and, according to his desire, let him be manifest or unmanifest to
common materially embodied people.
PURPORT
The demigods wanted Mahäräja Nimi to come to life, but Mahäräja Nimi
did not want to accept another material body. Under the circumstances, the
demigods, having been requested by the saintly persons, gave him the
benediction that he would be able to stay in his spiritual body. There are two
kinds of spiritual bodies, as generally understood by common men. The term
"spiritual body" is sometimes taken to refer to a ghostly body. An impious man
who dies after sinful activities is sometimes condemned so that he cannot
possess a gross material body of five material elements, but must live in a subtle
body of mind, intelligence and ego. However, as explained in Bhagavad-gétä,
devotees can give up the material body and attain a spiritual body free from all
material tinges, gross and subtle (tyaktvä dehaà punar janma naiti mäm eti so
'rjuna [Bg. 4.9]). Thus the demigods gave King Nimi the benediction that he
would be able to stay in a purely spiritual body, free from all gross and subtle
material contamination.
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
506
The Supreme Personality of Godhead can be seen or unseen according to
His own transcendental desire; similarly, a devotee, being jévan-mukta, can be
seen or not, as he chooses. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, nähaà prakäçaù
sarvasya yogamäyä-samävåtaù: [Bg. 7.25] the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Kåñëa, is not manifest to everyone and anyone. To the common man He is
unseen. Ataù çré-kåñëa-nämädi na bhaved grähyam indriyaiù: [Cc. Madhya
17.136] [Brs. 1.2.234] Kåñëa and His name, fame, qualities and paraphernalia
cannot be materially understood. Unless one is advanced in spiritual life
(sevonmukhe hi jihvädau), one cannot see Kåñëa. Therefore the ability to see
Kåñëa depends on Kåñëa's mercy. The same privilege of being seen or unseen
according to one's own desire was given to Mahäräja Nimi. Thus he lived in his
original, spiritual body as an associate of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Thereafter, to save the people from the danger of an unregulated
government, the sages churned Mahäräja Nimi's material body, from which, as
a result, a son was born.
PURPORT
Aräjaka-bhayam. If the government is unsteady and unregulated, there is
danger of fear for the people. At the present moment this danger always exists
because of government by the people. Here we can see that the great sages got
a son from Nimi's material body to guide the citizens properly, for such
guidance is the duty of a kñatriya king. A kñatriya is one who saves the citizens
from being injured. In the so-called people's government there is no trained
kñatriya king; as soon as someone strong accumulates votes, he becomes the
minister or president, without training from the learned brähmaëas expert in
the çästras. Indeed, we see that in some countries the government changes
from party to party, and therefore the men in charge of the government are
more eager to protect their position than to see that the citizens are happy.
The Vedic civilization prefers monarchy. People liked the government of Lord
Rämacandra, the government of Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira and the governments
of Mahäräja Parékñit, Mahäräja Ambaréña and Mahäräja Prahläda. There are
many instances of excellent government under a monarch. Gradually the
democratic government is becoming unfit for the needs of the people, and
therefore some parties are trying to elect a dictator. A dictatorship is the same
as a monarchy, but without a trained leader. Actually people will be happy
when a trained leader, whether a monarch or a dictator, takes control of the
government and rules the people according to the standard regulations of the
authorized scriptures.

TRANSLATION
Çukadeva Gosvämé said: My dear King Parékñit, all the kings of the dynasty
of Mithila were completely in knowledge of their spiritual identity. Therefore,
even though staying at home, they were liberated from the duality of material
existence.
PURPORT
This material world is called dvaita, or duality. The Caitanya-caritämåta
(Antya 4.176) says:
'dvaite 'bhadräbhadra-jïäna, saba—'manodharma'
'ei bhäla, ei manda,'—ei saba 'bhrama'
In the world of duality—that is to say, in the material world—so-called
goodness and badness are both the same. Therefore, in this world, to
distinguish between good and bad, happiness and distress, is meaningless
because they are both mental concoctions (manodharma). Because everything
here is miserable and troublesome, to create an artificial situation and pretend
it to be full of happiness is simply illusion. The liberated person, being above
the influence of the three modes of material nature, is unaffected by such
dualities in all circumstances. He remains Kåñëa conscious by tolerating
so-called happiness and distress. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä (2.14):
mäträ-sparçäs tu kaunteya
çétoñëa-sukha-duùkhadäù
ägamäpäyino 'nityäs
täàs titikñasva bhärata
"O son of Kunté, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and
their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
520
of winter and summer seasons. They arise from sense perception, O scion of
Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed." Those
who are liberated, being on the transcendental platform of rendering service
to the Lord, do not care about so-called happiness and distress. They know that
these are like changing seasons, which are perceivable by contact with the
material body. Happiness and distress come and go. Therefore a paëòita, a
learned man, is not concerned with them. As it is said, gatäsün agatäsüàç ca
nänuçocanti paëòitäù [Bg. 2.11]. The body is dead from the very beginning
because it is a lump of matter. It has no feelings of happiness and distress.
Because the soul within the body is in the bodily concept of life, he suffers
happiness and distress, but these come and go. It is understood herewith that
the kings born in the dynasty of Mithila were all liberated persons, unaffected
by the so-called happiness and distress of this world.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Thirteenth Chapter, of
the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Dynasty of Mahäräja Nimi."
14. King Purüravä Enchanted by Urvaçé
The summary of this Fourteenth Chapter is given as follows. This chapter
describes Soma and how he kidnapped the wife of Båhaspati and begot in her
womb a son named Budha. Budha begot Purüravä, who begot six sons, headed
by Äyu, in the womb of Urvaçé.
Lord Brahmä was born from the lotus that sprouted from the navel of
Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu. Brahmä had a son named Atri, and Atri's son was
Soma, the king of all drugs and stars. Soma became the conqueror of the entire
universe, and, being inflated with pride, he kidnapped Tärä, who was the wife
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
521
of Båhaspati, the spiritual master of the demigods. A great fight ensued
between the demigods and the asuras, but Brahmä rescued Båhaspati's wife
from the clutches of Soma and returned her to her husband, thus stopping the
fighting. In the womb of Tärä, Soma begot a son named Budha, who later begot
in the womb of Ilä a son named Aila, or Purüravä. Urvaçé was captivated by
Purüravä's beauty, and therefore she lived with him for some time, but when
she left his company he became almost like a madman. While traveling all over
the world, he met Urvaçé again at Kurukñetra, but she agreed to join with him
for only one night in a year.
One year later, Purüravä saw Urvaçé at Kurukñetra and was glad to be with
her for one night, but when he thought of her leaving him again, he was
overwhelmed by grief. Urvaçé then advised Purüravä to worship the
Gandharvas. Being satisfied with Purüravä, the Gandharvas gave him a
woman known as Agnisthälé. Purüravä mistook Agnisthälé for Urvaçé, but
while he was wandering in the forest his misunderstanding was cleared, and he
immediately gave up her company. After returning home and meditating upon
Urvaçé all night, he wanted to perform a Vedic ritualistic ceremony to satisfy
his desire. Thereafter he went to the same place where he had left Agnisthälé,
and there he saw that from the womb of a çamé tree had come an açvattha tree.
Purüravä made two sticks from this tree and thus produced a fire. By such a
fire one can satisfy all lusty desires. The fire was considered the son of
Purüravä. In Satya-yuga there was only one social division, called haàsa; there
were no divisions of varëa like brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra. The Veda
was the oàkära. The various demigods were not worshiped, for only the
Supreme Personality of Godhead was the worshipable Deity.

TRANSLATION
From Atri's tears of jubilation was born a son named Soma, the moon, who
was full of soothing rays. Lord Brahmä appointed him the director of the
brähmaëas, drugs and luminaries.
PURPORT
According to the Vedic description, Soma, the moon-god, was born from
the mind of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (candramä manaso jätaù).
But here we find that Soma was born from the tears in the eyes of Atri. This
appears contradictory to the Vedic information, but actually it is not, for this
birth of the moon is understood to have taken place in another millennium.
When tears appear in the eyes because of jubilation, the tears are soothing.
Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura says, dågbhya änandäçrubhya ata
evämåtamayaù: "Here the word dågbhyaù means 'from tears of jubilation.'
Therefore the moon-god is called amåtamayaù, 'full of soothing rays.' " In the
Fourth Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam (4.1.15) we find this verse:
atreù patny anasüyä tréï
jajïe suyaçasaù sutän
dattaà durväsasaà somam
ätmeça-brahma-sambhavän
This verse describes that Anasüyä, the wife of Atri Åñi, bore three
sons—Soma, Durväsä and Dattätreya. It is said that at the time of conception
Anasüyä was impregnated by the tears of Atri.

TRANSLATION
After conquering the three worlds [the upper, middle and lower planetary
systems], Soma, the moon-god, performed a great sacrifice known as the
Räjasüya-yajïa. Because he was very much puffed up, he forcibly kidnapped
Båhaspati's wife, whose name was Tärä.

TRANSLATION
Because of enmity between Båhaspati and Çukra, Çukra took the side of the
moon-god and was joined by the demons. But Lord Çiva, because of affection for
the son of his spiritual master, joined the side of Båhaspati and was
accompanied by all the ghosts and hobgoblins.
PURPORT
The moon-god is one of the demigods, but to fight against the other
demigods he took the assistance of the demons. Çukra, being an enemy of
Båhaspati, also joined the moon-god to retaliate in wrath against Båhaspati. To
counteract this situation, Lord Çiva, who was affectionate toward Båhaspati,
joined Båhaspati. The father of Båhaspati was Aìgirä, from whom Lord Çiva
had received knowledge. Therefore Lord Çiva had some affection for Båhaspati
and joined his side in this fight. Çrédhara Svämé remarks, aìgirasaù sakäçät
präpta-vidyo hara iti prasiddhaù: "Lord Çiva is well known to have received
knowledge from Aìgirä."

deliver your child! Immediately deliver it! Be assured that after the child is
delivered, I shall not burn you to ashes. I know that although you are unchaste,
you wanted a son. Therefore I shall not punish you.
PURPORT
Tärä was married to Båhaspati, and therefore as a chaste woman she should
have been impregnated by him. But instead she preferred to be impregnated by
Soma, the moon-god, and therefore she was unchaste. Although Båhaspati
accepted Tärä from Brahmä, when he saw that she was pregnant he wanted
her to deliver a son immediately. Tärä certainly very much feared her husband,
and she thought she might be punished after giving birth. Thus Båhaspati
assured her that he would not punish her, for although she was unchaste and
had become pregnant illicitly, she wanted a son.

with a golden bodily hue. Both Båhaspati and the moon-god, Soma, desired the
beautiful child.

was ashamed she could not immediately answer.

PURPORT
As stated in the Brahma-saàhitä (5.40), yasya prabhä prabhavato
jagad-aëòa-koöi-koöiñv açeña-vasudhädi-vibhüti-bhinnam. There are various
planets and various atmospheres within this universe. The atmosphere of the
heavenly planet from which Urvaçé descended after being cursed by Mitra and
Varuëa was different from the atmosphere of this earth. Indeed, the
inhabitants of the heavenly planets are certainly far superior to the
inhabitants of earth. Nonetheless, Urvaçé agreed to remain the consort of
Purüravä, although she belonged to a superior community. A woman who finds
a man with superior qualities may accept such a man as her husband. Similarly,
if a man finds a woman who is from an inferior family but who has good
qualities, he can accept such a brilliant wife, as advised by Çré Cäëakya
Paëòita (stré-ratnaà duñkuläd api). The combination of male and female is

TRANSLATION
Purüravä replied: O beautiful one, your beauty is wonderful and your
gestures are also wonderful. Indeed, you are attractive to all human society.
Therefore, since you have come of your own accord from the heavenly planets,
who on earth would not agree to serve a demigoddess such as you.
PURPORT
It appears from the words of Urvaçé that the standard of living, eating,
behavior and speech are all different on the heavenly planets from the
standards on this planet earth. The inhabitants of the heavenly planets do not
eat such abominable things as meat and eggs; everything they eat is prepared
in clarified butter. Nor do they like to see either men or women naked, except
at the time of sexual intercourse. To live naked or almost naked is uncivilized,
but on this planet earth it has now become fashionable to dress half naked, and
sometimes those like hippies live completely naked. Indeed, there are many

clubs and societies for this purpose. Such conduct is not allowed, however, on
the heavenly planets. The inhabitants of the heavenly planets, aside from
being very beautiful, both in complexion and bodily features, are well behaved
and long-living, and they eat first-class food in goodness. These are some of the
distinctions between the inhabitants of the heavenly planets and the
inhabitants of earth.

Urvaçé said: My dear King, you are a man, a hero. Don't be impatient and
give up your life. Be sober and don't allow the senses to overcome you like
foxes. Don't let the foxes eat you. In other words, you should not be controlled
by your senses. Rather, you should know that the heart of a woman is like that
of a fox. There is no use making friendship with women.
PURPORT
Cäëakya Paëòita has advised, viçväso naiva kartavyaù stréñu räja-kuleñu ca:
"Never place your faith in a woman or a politician." Unless elevated to
spiritual consciousness, everyone is conditioned and fallen, what to speak of
women, who are less intelligent than men. Women have been compared to
çüdras and vaiçyas (striyo vaiçyäs tathä çüdräù [Bg. 9.32]). On the spiritual
platform, however, when one is elevated to the platform of Kåñëa
consciousness, whether one is a man, woman, çüdra or whatever, everyone is
equal. Otherwise, Urvaçé, who was a woman herself and who knew the nature
of women, said that a woman's heart is like that of a sly fox. If a man cannot
control his senses, he becomes a victim of such sly foxes. But if one can control
the senses, there is no chance of his being victimized by sly, foxlike women.
Cäëakya Paëòita has also advised that if one has a wife like a sly fox, he must

immediately give up his life at home and go to the forest.

Kåñëa conscious gåhasthas must be very careful of the sly fox woman. If the
wife at home is obedient and follows her husband in Kåñëa consciousness, the
home is welcome. Otherwise one should give up one's home and go to the
forest.

TRANSLATION
Women as a class are merciless and cunning. They cannot tolerate even a
slight offense. For their own pleasure they can do anything irreligious, and
therefore they do not fear killing even a faithful husband or brother.
PURPORT
King Purüravä was greatly attached to Urvaçé. Yet despite his faithfulness
to her, she had left him. Now, considering that the King was wasting his rarely
achieved human form of life, Urvaçé frankly explained the nature of a woman.
Because of her nature, a woman can respond to even a slight offense from her
husband by not only leaving him but even killing him if required. To say
nothing of her husband, she can even kill her brother. That is a woman's
nature. Therefore, in the material world, unless women are trained to be
chaste and faithful to their husbands, there cannot be peace or prosperity in
society.

TRANSLATION
Women are very easily seduced by men. Therefore, polluted women give up
the friendship of a man who is their well-wisher and establish false friendship
among fools. Indeed, they seek newer and newer friends, one after another.
PURPORT
Because women are easily seduced, the Manu-saàhitä enjoins that they
should not be given freedom. A woman must always be protected, either by her
father, by her husband, or by her elderly son. If women are given freedom to
mingle with men like equals, which they now claim to be, they cannot keep
their propriety. The nature of a woman, as personally described by Urvaçé, is to
establish false friendship with someone and then seek new male companions,
one after another, even if this means giving up the company of a sincere
well-wisher.

Urvaçé said: "My dear King, seek shelter of the Gandharvas, for they will be
able to deliver me to you again." In accordance with these words, the King
satisfied the Gandharvas by prayers, and the Gandharvas, being pleased with
him, gave him an Agnisthälé girl who looked exactly like Urvaçé. Thinking that
the girl was Urvaçé, the King began walking with her in the forest, but later he
could understand that she was not Urvaçé but Agnisthälé.

Immediately after getting the Agnisthälé girl, he wanted to have sex with her,
but during sexual intercourse he could understand that the girl was Agnisthälé,
not Urvaçé. This indicates that every man attached to a particular woman
knows the particular characteristics of that woman during sex life. Thus
Purüravä understood during sexual intercourse that the Agnisthälé girl was not
Urvaçé.

SYNONYMS
sthälém—the woman Agnisthälé; nyasya—immediately giving up; vane—in the
forest; gatvä—on returning; gåhän—at home; ädhyäyataù—began to meditate;
niçi—the whole night; tretäyäm—when the Tretä millennium;
sampravåttäyäm—was just on the point of beginning; manasi—in his mind;
trayé—the principles of the three Vedas; avartata—became revealed.
TRANSLATION
King Purüravä then left Agnisthälé in the forest and returned home, where
he meditated all night upon Urvaçé. In the course of his meditation, the Tretä
millennium began, and therefore the principles of the three Vedas, including
the process of performing yajïa to fulfill fruitive activities, appeared within his
heart.
PURPORT
It is said, tretäyäà yajato makhaiù: in Tretä-yuga, if one performed yajïas,
he would get the results of those yajïas. By performing viñëu-yajïa specifically,
one could even achieve the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Of course, yajïa is intended to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
While Purüravä was meditating upon Urvaçé, the Tretä-yuga began, and
therefore the Vedic yajïas were revealed in his heart. But Purüravä was a
materialistic man, especially interested in enjoying the senses. Yajïas for
enjoyment of the senses are called karma-käëòéya-yajïas. Therefore, he
decided to perform karma-käëòéya-yajïas to fulfill his lusty desires. In other
words, karma-käëòéya-yajïas are meant for sensuous persons, whereas yajïa
should actually be performed to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

561
To please the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Kali-yuga, the
saìkértana-yajïa is recommended. Yajïaiù saìkértana-präyair yajanti hi
sumedhasaù [SB 11.5.32]. Only those who are very intelligent take to
saìkértana-yajïa to fulfill all their desires, material and spiritual, whereas those
who are lusty for sense enjoyment perform karma-käëòéya-yajïas.

TRANSLATION
When the process of fruitive yajïa became manifest within his heart, King
Purüravä went to the same spot where he had left Agnisthälé. There he saw
that from the womb of a çamé tree, an açvattha tree had grown. He then took a
piece of wood from that tree and made it into two araëis. Desiring to go to the
planet where Urvaçé resided, he chanted mantras, meditating upon the lower
araëi as Urvaçé, the upper one as himself, and the piece of wood between them
as his son. In this way he began to ignite a fire.
PURPORT
The Vedic fire for performing yajïa was not ignited with ordinary matches
or similar devices. Rather, the Vedic sacrificial fire was ignited by the araëis,
or two sacred pieces of wood, which produced fire by friction with a third.
Such a fire is necessary for the performance of yajïa. If successful, a yajïa will
fulfill the desire of its performer. Thus Purüravä took advantage of the process
of yajïa to fulfill his lusty desires. He thought of the lower araëi as Urvaçé, the
upper one as himself, and the middle one as his son. A relevant Vedic mantra
quoted herein by Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura is çamé-garbhäd agnià
mantha. A similar mantra is urvaçyäm urasi purüraväù. Purüravä wanted to
have children continuously by the womb of Urvaçé. His only ambition was to
have sex life with Urvaçé and thereby get a son. In other words, he had so
much lust in his heart that even while performing yajïa he thought of Urvaçé,
instead of thinking of the master of yajïa, Yajïeçvara, Lord Viñëu.

tasya—of Purüravä; nirmanthanät—because of interaction; jätaù—was born;

vibhävasuù—a fire; trayyä—following the Vedic principles; saù—the fire;

TRANSLATION
From Purüravä's rubbing of the araëis came a fire. By such a fire one can
achieve all success in material enjoyment and be purified in seminal birth,
initiation and in the performance of sacrifice, which are invoked with the
combined letters a-u-m. Thus the fire was considered the son of King Purüravä.
PURPORT
According to the Vedic process, one can get a son through semen (çukra),
one can get a bona fide disciple through initiation (sävitra), or one can get a
son or disciple through the fire of sacrifice (yajïa). Thus when Mahäräja
Purüravä generated the fire by rubbing the araëis, the fire became his son.
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
564
Either by semen, by initiation or by yajïa one may get a son. The Vedic mantra
oàkära, or praëava, consisting of the letters a-u-m, can call each of these three
methods into existence. Therefore the words nirmanthanäj jätaù indicate that
by the rubbing of the araëis a son was born.

TRANSLATION
By means of that fire, Purüravä, who desired to go to the planet where
Urvaçé resided, performed a sacrifice, by which he satisfied the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Hari, the enjoyer of the results of sacrifice. Thus he
worshiped the Lord, who is beyond the perception of the senses and is the
reservoir of all the demigods.

PURPORT
As stated in Bhagavad-gétä, bhoktäraà yajïa-tapasäà
sarva-loka-maheçvaram: [Bg. 5.29] any loka, or planet, to which one wants to go
is the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the enjoyer of the
performance of sacrifice. The purpose of yajïa is to satisfy the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. In this age, as we have explained many times, the
yajïa of chanting the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra is the only sacrifice that can
satisfy the Supreme Lord. When the Lord is satisfied, one can fulfill any desire,
material or spiritual. Bhagavad-gétä (3.14) also says, yajïäd bhavati parjanyaù:
by offering sacrifices to Lord Viñëu, one can have sufficient rainfall. When
there is sufficient rainfall, the earth becomes fit to produce everything
(sarva-käma-dughä mahé). If one can utilize the land properly, one can get all
the necessities of life from the land, including food grains, fruits, flowers and
vegetables. Everything one gets for material wealth is produced from the earth,
and therefore it is said, sarva-käma-dughä mahé (SB 1.10.4). Everything is
possible by performing yajïa. Therefore although Purüravä desired something
material, he factually performed yajïa to please the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. The Lord is adhokñaja, beyond the perception of Purüravä and
everyone else. Consequently, some kind of yajïa must be performed to fulfill
the desires of the living entity. Yajïas can be performed in human society only
when society is divided by varëäçrama-dharma into four varëas and four
äçramas. Without such a regulative process, no one can perform yajïas, and
without the performance of yajïas, no material plans can make human society
happy at any time. Everyone should therefore be induced to perform yajïas. In
this age of Kali, the yajïa recommended is saìkértana, the individual or
collective chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra. This will bring the
fulfillment of all necessities for human society.

ekaù—only one; eva—indeed; purä—formerly; vedaù—book of transcendental
knowledge; praëavaù—oàkära; sarva-väk-mayaù—consisting of all Vedic
mantras; devaù—the Lord, God; näräyaëaù—only Näräyaëa (was worshipable
in the Satya-yuga); na anyaù—no other; ekaù agniù—one division only for
agni; varëaù—order of life; eva ca—and certainly.
TRANSLATION
In the Satya-yuga, the first millennium, all the Vedic mantras were included
in one mantra-praëava, the root of all Vedic mantras. In other words, the
Atharva Veda alone was the source of all Vedic knowledge. The Supreme
Personality of Godhead Näräyaëa was the only worshipable Deity; there was no
recommendation for worship of the demigods. Fire was one only, and the only
order of life in human society was known as haàsa.
PURPORT
In Satya-yuga there was only one Veda, not four. Later, before the
beginning of Kali-yuga, this one Veda, the Atharva Veda (or, some say, the
Yajur Veda), was divided into four—Säma, Yajur, Åg and Atharva—for the
facility of human society. In Satya-yuga the only mantra was oàkära (oà tat
sat). The same name oàkära is manifest in the mantra Hare Kåñëa, Hare
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
567
Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare
Hare. Unless one is a brähmaëa, one cannot utter oàkära and get the desired
result. But in Kali-yuga almost everyone is a çüdra, unfit for pronouncing the
praëava, oàkära. Therefore the çästras have recommended the chanting of the
Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra. Oàkära is a mantra, or mahä-mantra, and Hare
Kåñëa is also a mahä-mantra. The purpose of pronouncing oàkära is to address
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Väsudeva (oà namo bhagavate
väsudeväya). And the purpose of chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra is the same.
Hare: "O energy of the Lord!" Kåñëa: "O Lord Kåñëa!" Hare: "O energy of the
Lord!" Räma: "O Supreme Lord, O supreme enjoyer!" The only worshipable
Lord is Hari, who is the goal of the Vedas (vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù
[Bg. 15.15]). By worshiping the demigods, one worships the different parts of
the Lord, just as one might water the branches and twigs of a tree. But
worshiping Näräyaëa, the all-inclusive Supreme Personality of Godhead, is
like pouring water on the root of the tree, thus supplying water to the trunk,
branches, twigs, leaves and so on. In Satya-yuga people knew how to fulfill the
necessities of life simply by worshiping Näräyaëa, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. The same purpose can be served in this age of Kali by the chanting
of the Hare Kåñëa mantra, as recommended in the Bhägavatam. Kértanäd eva
kåñëasya mukta-saìgaù paraà vrajet [SB 12.3.51]. Simply by chanting the Hare
Kåñëa mantra, one becomes free from the bondage of material existence and
thus becomes eligible to return home, back to Godhead.

O Mahäräja Parékñit, at the beginning of Tretä-yuga, King Purüravä
inaugurated a karma-käëòa sacrifice. Thus Purüravä, who considered the yajïic
fire his son, was able to go to Gandharvaloka as he desired.
PURPORT
In Satya-yuga, Lord Näräyaëa was worshiped by meditation (kåte yad
dhyäyato viñëum). Indeed, everyone always meditated upon Lord Viñëu,
Näräyaëa, and achieved every success by this process of meditation. In the
next yuga, Tretä-yuga, the performance of yajïa began (tretäyäà yajato
mukhaiù). Therefore this verse says, trayé tretä-mukhe. Ritualistic ceremonies
are generally called fruitive activities. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura
says that in Tretä-yuga, beginning in the Sväyambhuva-manvantara, ritualistic
fruitive activities were similarly manifested from Priyavrata, etc.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Fourteenth Chapter, of
the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "King Purüravä Enchanted by Urvaçé."

15. Paraçuräma, the Lord's Warrior Incarnation
This chapter describes the history of Gädhi in the dynasty of Aila.
From the womb of Urvaçé came six sons, named Äyu, Çrutäyu, Satyäyu,
Raya, Jaya and Vijaya. The son of Çrutäyu was Vasumän, the son of Satyäyu
was Çrutaïjaya, the son of Raya was Eka, the son of Jaya was Amita, and the
son of Vijaya was Bhéma. Bhéma's son was named Käïcana, the son of Käïcana
was Hotraka, and the son of Hotraka was Jahnu, who was celebrated for having
drunk all the water of the Ganges in one sip. The descendants of Jahnu, one
after another, were Puru, Baläka, Ajaka and Kuça. The sons of Kuça were
Kuçämbu, Tanaya, Vasu and Kuçanäbha. From Kuçämbu came Gädhi, who had
a daughter named Satyavaté. Satyavaté married Åcéka Muni after the muni
contributed a substantial dowry, and from the womb of Satyavaté by Åcéka
Muni, Jamadagni was born. The son of Jamadagni was Räma, or Paraçuräma.
When a king named Kärtavéryärjuna stole Jamadagni's desire cow, Paraçuräma,
who is ascertained by learned experts to be a saktyäveça incarnation of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, killed Kärtavéryärjuna. Later, he annihilated
the kñatriya dynasty twenty-one times. After Paraçuräma killed
Kärtavéryärjuna, Jamadagni told him that killing a king is sinful and that as a
brähmaëa he should have tolerated the offense. Therefore Jamadagni advised
Paraçuräma to atone for his sin by traveling to various holy places.

TRANSLATION
Thereafter, Åcéka Muni's wife and mother-in-law, each desiring a son,
requested the Muni to prepare an oblation. Thus Åcéka Muni prepared one
oblation for his wife with a brähmaëa mantra and another for his mother-in-law
with a kñatriya mantra. Then he went out to bathe.

TRANSLATION
Meanwhile, because Satyavaté's mother thought that the oblation prepared
for her daughter, Åcéka's wife, must be better, she asked her daughter for that
oblation. Satyavaté therefore gave her own oblation to her mother and ate her
mother's oblation herself.
PURPORT
A husband naturally has some affection for his wife. Therefore Satyavaté's
mother thought that the oblation prepared for Satyavaté by the sage Åcéka
must have been better than her own oblation. In Åcéka's absence, the mother
took the better oblation from Satyavaté and ate it.

ghoraù—fierce; daëòa-dharaù—a great personality who can punish others;
putraù—such a son; bhrätä—brother; te—your; brahma-vittamaù—a learned
scholar in spiritual science.
TRANSLATION
When the great sage Åcéka returned home after bathing and understood
what had happened in his absence, he said to his wife, Satyavaté, "You have
done a great wrong. Your son will be a fierce kñatriya, able to punish everyone,
and your brother will be a learned scholar in spiritual science."
PURPORT
A brähmaëa is highly qualified when he can control his senses and mind,
when he is a learned scholar in spiritual science and when he is tolerant and
forgiving. A kñatriya, however, is highly qualified when he is fierce in giving
punishment to wrongdoers. These qualities are stated in Bhagavad-gétä
(18.42-43). Because Satyavaté, instead of eating her own oblation, had eaten
that which was meant for her mother, she would give birth to a son imbued
with the kñatriya spirit. This was undesirable. The son of a brähmaëa is
generally expected to become a brähmaëa, but if such a son becomes fierce like
a kñatriya, he is designated according to the description of the four varëas in
Bhagavad-gétä (cätur-varëyaà mayä såñöaà guëa-karma-vibhägaçaù [Bg. 4.13]).
If the son of a brähmaëa does not become like a brähmaëa, he may be called a
kñatriya, vaiçya or çüdra, according to his qualifications. The basic principle for
dividing society is not a person's birth but his qualities and actions.

TRANSLATION
Satyavaté, however, pacified Åcéka Muni with peaceful words and requested
that her son not be like a fierce kñatriya. Åcéka Muni replied, "Then your
grandson will be of a kñatriya spirit." Thus Jamadagni was born as the son of
Satyavaté.
PURPORT
The great sage Åcéka was very angry, but somehow or other Satyavaté
pacified him, and at her request he changed his mind. It is indicated here that
the son of Jamadagni would be born as Paraçuräma.

TRANSLATION
When the royal dynasty, being excessively proud because of the material
modes of passion and ignorance, became irreligious and ceased to care for the
laws enacted by the brähmaëas, Paraçuräma killed them. Although their offense
was not very severe, he killed them to lessen the burden of the world.
PURPORT
The kñatriyas, or the ruling class, must govern the world in accordance with
the rules and regulations enacted by great brähmaëas and saintly persons. As
soon as the ruling class becomes irresponsible in regard to the religious
principles, it becomes a burden on the earth. As stated here, rajas-tamo-våtaà,
bhäram abrahmaëyam: when the ruling class is influenced by the lower modes
of nature, namely ignorance and passion, it becomes a burden to the world and
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
582
must then be annihilated by superior power. We actually see from modern
history that monarchies have been abolished by various revolutions, but
unfortunately the monarchies have been abolished to establish the supremacy
of third-class and fourth-class men. Although monarchies overpowered by the
modes of passion and ignorance have been abolished in the world, the
inhabitants of the world are still unhappy, for although the qualities of the
former monarchs were degraded by taints of ignorance, these monarchs have
been replaced by men of the mercantile and worker classes whose qualities are
even more degraded. When the government is actually guided by brähmaëas,
or God conscious men, then there can be real happiness for the people.
Therefore in previous times, when the ruling class was degraded to the modes
of passion and ignorance, the brähmaëas, headed by such a kñatriya-spirited
brähmaëa as Paraçuräma, killed them twenty-one consecutive times.
In Kali-yuga, as stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (12.2.13), dasyu-präyeñu
räjasu: the ruling class (räjanya) will be no better than plunderers (dasyus)
because the third-class and fourth-class men will monopolize the affairs of the
government. Ignoring the religious principles and brahminical rules and
regulations, they will certainly try to plunder the riches of the citizens without
consideration. As stated elsewhere in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (12.1.40):
asaàskåtäù kriyä-hénä
rajasä tamasävåtäù
prajäs te bhakñayiñyanti
mlecchä räjanya-rüpiëaù
Being unpurified, neglecting to discharge human duties properly, and being
influenced by the modes of passion (rajas) and ignorance (tamas), unclean
people (mlecchas), posing as members of the government (räjanya-rüpiëaù),
will swallow the citizens (präjas te bhakñayiñyanti). And in still another place,
Çrémad-Bhägavatam (12.2.7-8) says:
evaà prajäbhir duñöäbhir

prajä hi lubdhai räjanyair
nirghåëair dasyu-dharmabhiù
äcchinna-dära-draviëä
yäsyanti giri-känanam
Human society is naturally grouped into four divisions, as stated in
Bhagavad-gétä (cätur-varëyaà mayä såñöaà guëa-karma-vibhägaçaù [Bg. 4.13]).
But if this system is neglected and the qualities and divisions of society are not
considered, the result will be brahma-viö-kñatra-çüdräëäà yo balé bhavitä nåpaù:
the so-called caste system of brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra will be
meaningless. As a result, whoever somehow or other becomes powerful will be
the king or president, and thus the prajäs, or citizens, will be so harassed that
they will give up hearth and home and will go to the forest (yäsyanti
giri-känanam) to escape harassment by government officials who have no
mercy and are addicted to the ways of plunderers. Therefore the prajäs, or the
people in general, must take to the Kåñëa consciousness movement, the Hare
Kåñëa movement, which is the sound incarnation of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. Kali-käle näma-rüpe kåñëa-avatära: Kåñëa, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, has now appeared as an incarnation by His holy
name. Therefore, when the prajäs become Kåñëa conscious, they can then
expect a good government and good society, a perfect life, and liberation from
the bondage of material existence.

we speak of a king, we understand that he is accompanied by many followers.
Jamadagni was able to receive all the King's followers properly and feed them
sumptuously with food prepared in ghee. The King was astonished at how
opulent Jamadagni was because of possessing only one cow, and therefore he
became envious of the great sage. This was the beginning of his offense.
Paraçuräma, the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, killed
Kärtavéryärjuna because Kärtavéryärjuna was too proud. One may possess
unusual opulence in this material world, but if one becomes puffed up and acts
whimsically he will be punished by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This
is the lesson to learn from this history, in which Paraçuräma became angry at
Kärtavéryärjuna and killed him and rid the entire world of kñatriyas
twenty-one times.

SYNONYMS
saù—he (Kärtavéryärjuna); vai—indeed; ratnam—a great source of wealth;
tu—indeed; tat—the kämadhenu in the possession of Jamadagni; dåñövä—by
observing; ätma-aiçvarya—his own personal opulence; ati-çäyanam—which

was exceeding; tat—that; na—not; ädriyata—appreciated very much;
agnihotryäm—in that cow, which was useful for executing the agnihotra
sacrifice; sa-abhiläñaù—became desirous; sa-haihayaù—with his own men, the
Haihayas.
TRANSLATION
Kärtavéryärjuna thought that Jamadagni was more powerful and wealthy
than himself because of possessing a jewel in the form of the kämadhenu.
Therefore he and his own men, the Haihayas, were not very much appreciative
of Jamadagni's reception. On the contrary, they wanted to possess that
kämadhenu, which was useful for the execution of the agnihotra sacrifice.
PURPORT
Jamadagni was more powerful than Kärtavéryärjuna because of performing
the agnihotra-yajïa with clarified butter received from the kämadhenu. Not
everyone can be expected to possess such a cow. Nonetheless, an ordinary man
may possess an ordinary cow, give protection to this animal, take sufficient
milk from it, and engage the milk to produce butter and clarified ghee,
especially for performing the agnihotra-yajïa. This is possible for everyone.
Thus we find that in Bhagavad-gétä Lord Kåñëa advises go-rakñya, the
protection of cows. This is essential because if cows are cared for properly they
will surely supply sufficient milk. We have practical experience in America
that in our various ISKCON farms we are giving proper protection to the cows
and receiving more than enough milk. In other farms the cows do not deliver
as much milk as in our farms; because our cows know very well that we are not
going to kill them, they are happy, and they give ample milk. Therefore this
instruction given by Lord Kåñëa—go-rakñya—is extremely meaningful. The
whole world must learn from Kåñëa how to live happily without scarcity simply
by producing food grains (annäd bhavanti bhütäni [Bg. 3.14]) and giving
protection to the cows (go-rakñya). Kåñi-go-rakñya-väëijyaà vaiçya-karma
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
593
svabhävajam [Bg. 18.44]. Those who belong to the third level of human society,
namely the mercantile people, must keep land for producing food grains and
giving protection to cows. This is the injunction of Bhagavad-gétä. In the
matter of protecting the cows, the meat-eaters will protest, but in answer to
them we may say that since Kåñëa gives stress to cow protection, those who are
inclined to eat meat may eat the flesh of unimportant animals like hogs, dogs,
goats and sheep, but they should not touch the life of the cows, for this is
destructive to the spiritual advancement of human society.

men (soldiers); hartum—to steal or take away; acodayat—encouraged; te—the
men of Kärtavéryärjuna; ca—also; mähiñmatém—to the capital of
Kärtavéryärjuna; ninyuù—brought; sa-vatsäm—with the calf;

Being puffed up by material power, Kärtavéryärjuna encouraged his men to
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com

steal Jamadagni's kämadhenu. Thus the men forcibly took away the crying
kämadhenu, along with her calf, to Mähiñmaté, Kärtavéryärjuna's capital.
PURPORT
The word havirdhäném is significant in this verse. Havirdhäném refers to a
cow required for supplying havis, or ghee, for the performance of ritualistic
ceremonies in sacrifices. In human life, one should be trained to perform
yajïas. As we are informed in Bhagavad-gétä (3.9), yajïärthät karmaëo 'nyatra
loko 'yaà karma-bandhanaù: if we do not perform yajïa, we shall simply work
very hard for sense gratification like dogs and hogs. This is not civilization. A
human being should be trained to perform yajïa. Yajïäd bhavati parjanyaù [Bg.
3.14]. If yajïas are regularly performed, there will be proper rain from the sky,
and when there is regular rainfall, the land will be fertile and suitable for
producing all the necessities of life. Yajïa, therefore, is essential. For
performing yajïa, clarified butter is essential, and for clarified butter, cow
protection is essential. Therefore, if we neglect the Vedic way of civilization,
we shall certainly suffer. So-called scholars and philosophers do not know the
secret of success in life, and therefore they suffer in the hands of prakåti,
nature (prakåteù kriyamäëäni guëaiù karmäëi sarvaçaù [Bg. 3.27]). Nonetheless,
although they are forced to suffer, they think they are advancing in
civilization (ahaìkära-vimüòhätmä kartäham iti manyate). The Kåñëa
consciousness movement is therefore meant to revive a mode of civilization in
which everyone will be happy. This is the motive of our Kåñëa consciousness
movement. Yajïe sukhena bhavantu.

In the beginning, when the army of the enemy was full of fighting soldiers,

Cäëakya Paëòita says that the cuckoo bird, although very black, is beautiful
because of its sweet voice. Similarly, a woman becomes beautiful by her
chastity and faithfulness to her husband, and an ugly person becomes beautiful
when he becomes a learned scholar. In the same way, brähmaëas, kñatriyas,
vaiçyas and çüdras become beautiful by their qualities. Brähmaëas are beautiful
when they are forgiving, kñatriyas when they are heroic and never retreat from
fighting, vaiçyas when they enrich cultural activities and protect cows, and
çüdras when they are faithful in the discharge of duties pleasing to their
masters. Thus everyone becomes beautiful by his special qualities. And the
special quality of the brähmaëa, as described here, is forgiveness.

My dear son, killing a king who is an emperor is more severely sinful than
killing a brähmaëa. But now, if you become Kåñëa conscious and worship the
holy places, you can atone for this great sin.
PURPORT
One who fully surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is freed
from all sins (ahaà tväà sarva-päpebhyo mokñayiñyämi [Bg. 18.66]). From the
very day or moment he fully surrenders to Çré Kåñëa, even the most sinful
person is freed. Nonetheless, as an example, Jamadagni advised his son
Paraçuräma to worship the holy places. Because an ordinary person cannot
immediately surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is advised
to go from one holy place to another to find saintly persons and thus gradually
be released from sinful reactions.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Fifteenth Chapter, of
the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "Paraçuräma, the Lord's Warrior Incarnation."
16. Lord Paraçuräma Destroys the World's Ruling Class
When Jamadagni was killed by the sons of Kärtavéryärjuna, as described in
this chapter, Paraçuräma rid the entire world of kñatriyas twenty-one times.
This chapter also describes the descendants of Viçvämitra.
When Jamadagni's wife, Reëukä, went to bring water from the Ganges and
saw the King of the Gandharvas enjoying the company of Apsaräs, she was
captivated, and she slightly desired to associate with him. Because of this sinful
desire, she was punished by her husband. Paraçuräma killed his mother and

611
brothers, but later, by dint of the austerities of Jamadagni, they were revived.
The sons of Kärtavéryärjuna, however, remembering the death of their father,
wanted to take revenge against Lord Paraçuräma, and therefore when
Paraçuräma was absent from the äçrama, they killed Jamadagni, who was
meditating on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When Paraçuräma
returned to the äçrama and saw his father killed, he was very sorry, and after
asking his brothers to take care of the dead body, he went out with
determination to kill all the kñatriyas on the surface of the world. Taking up
his axe, he went to Mähiñmaté-pura, the capital of Kärtavéryärjuna, and killed
all of Kärtavéryärjuna's sons, whose blood became a great river. Paraçuräma,
however, was not satisfied with killing only the sons of Kärtavéryärjuna; later,
when the kñatriyas became disturbing, he killed them twenty-one times, so that
there were no kñatriyas on the surface of the earth. Thereafter, Paraçuräma
joined the head of his father to the dead body and performed various sacrifices
to please the Supreme Lord. Thus Jamadagni got life again in his body, and
later he was promoted to the higher planetary system known as
Saptarñi-maëòala. Paraçuräma, the son of Jamadagni, still lives in
Mahendra-parvata. In the next manvantara, he will become a preacher of
Vedic knowledge.
In the dynasty of Gädhi, the most powerful Viçvämitra took birth. By dint
of his austerity and penance, he became a brähmaëa. He had 101 sons, who
were celebrated as the Madhucchandäs. In the sacrificial arena of Hariçcandra,
the son of Ajégarta named Çunaùçepha was meant to be sacrificed, but by the
mercy of the Prajäpatis he was released. Thereafter, he became Devaräta in the
dynasty of Gädhi. The fifty elder sons of Viçvämitra, however, did not accept
Çunaùçepha as their elder brother, and therefore Viçvämitra cursed them to
become mlecchas, unfaithful to the Vedic civilization. Viçvämitra's fifty-first
son, along with his younger brothers, then accepted Çunaùçepha as their eldest
brother, and their father, Viçvämitra, being satisfied, blessed them. Thus
Devaräta was accepted in the dynasty of Kauçika, and consequently there are
different divisions of that dynasty.

his father would be pleased, and when his father was pleased, Paraçuräma

My dear King Parékñit, the sons of Kärtavéryärjuna, who were defeated by
the superior strength of Paraçuräma, never achieved happiness, for they always
remembered the killing of their father.
PURPORT
Jamadagni was certainly very powerful due to his austerities, but because of
a slight offense by his poor wife, Reëukä, he ordered that she be killed. This
certainly was a sinful act, and therefore Jamadagni was killed by the sons of
Kärtavéryärjuna, as described herein. Lord Paraçuräma was also infected by sin
because of killing Kärtavéryärjuna, although this was not very offensive.
Therefore, whether one be Kärtavéryärjuna, Lord Paraçuräma, Jamadagni or
whoever one may be, one must act very cautiously and sagaciously; otherwise
one must suffer the results of sinful activities. This is the lesson we receive
from Vedic literature.

TRANSLATION
With the blood of the bodies of these sons, Lord Paraçuräma created a
ghastly river, which brought great fear to the kings who had no respect for
brahminical culture. Because the kñatriyas, the men of power in government,
were performing sinful activities, Lord Paraçuräma, on the plea of retaliating for
the murder of his father, rid all the kñatriyas from the face of the earth
twenty-one times. Indeed, in the place known as Samanta-païcaka he created
nine lakes filled with their blood.
PURPORT
Paraçuräma is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and his eternal mission
is pariträëäya sädhünäà vinäçäya ca duñkåtäm [Bg. 4.8]—to protect the
devotees and annihilate the miscreants. To kill all the sinful men is one among
the tasks of the incarnation of Godhead. Lord Paraçuräma killed all the
kñatriyas twenty-one times consecutively because they were disobedient to the
brahminical culture. That the kñatriyas had killed his father was only a plea;
the real fact is that because the kñatriyas, the ruling class, had become polluted,
their position was inauspicious. Brahminical culture is enjoined in the çästra,
especially in Bhagavad-gétä (cätur-varëyaà mayä såñöaà
guëa-karma-vibhägaçaù [Bg. 4.13]). According to the laws of nature, whether at

the time of Paraçuräma or at the present, if the government becomes
irresponsible and sinful, not caring for brahminical culture, there will certainly
be an incarnation of God like Paraçuräma to create a devastation by fire,
famine, pestilence or some other calamity. Whenever the government
disrespects the supremacy of the Personality of Godhead and fails to protect
the institution of varëäçrama-dharma, it will certainly have to face such
catastrophes as formerly brought about by Lord Paraçuräma.

Thereafter, having completed the ritualistic sacrificial ceremonies, Lord
Paraçuräma took the bath known as the avabhåtha-snäna. Standing on the bank
of the great river Sarasvaté, cleared of all sins, Lord Paraçuräma appeared like
the sun in a clear, cloudless sky.
PURPORT
As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (3.9), yajïärthät karmaëo 'nyatra loko 'yaà
karma-bandhanaù: "Work done as a sacrifice for Viñëu has to be performed,
otherwise work binds one to this material world." Karma-bandhanaù refers to
the repeated acceptance of one material body after another. The whole
problem of life is this repetition of birth and death. Therefore one is advised to
work to perform yajïa meant for satisfying Lord Viñëu. Although Lord
Paraçuräma was an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he
had to account for sinful activities. Anyone in this material world, however
careful he may be, must commit some sinful activities, even though he does not
want to. For example, one may trample many small ants and other insects
while walking on the street and kill many living beings unknowingly.
Therefore the Vedic principle of païca-yajïa, five kinds of recommended
sacrifice, is compulsory. In this age of Kali, however, there is a great concession
given to people in general. Yajïaiù saìkértana-präyair yajanti hi sumedhasaù:
[SB 11.5.32] we may worship Lord Caitanya, the hidden incarnation of Kåñëa.
Kåñëa-varëaà tviñäkåñëam: although He is Kåñëa Himself, He always chants
Hare Kåñëa and preaches Kåñëa consciousness. One is recommended to
worship this incarnation by chanting, the saìkértana-yajïa. The performance
of saìkértana-yajïa is a special concession for human society to save people
from being affected by known or unknown sinful activities. We are surrounded
by unlimited sins, and therefore it is compulsory that one take to Kåñëa

Gautama, Jamadagni and Bharadväja. These seven stars are seen every night,

Viçvämitra, the son of Mahäräja Gädhi, was as powerful as the flames of fire.
From the position of a kñatriya, he achieved the position of a powerful
brähmaëa by undergoing penances and austerities.
PURPORT
Now, having narrated the history of Lord Paraçuräma, Çukadeva Gosvämé
begins the history of Viçvämitra. From the history of Paraçuräma we can
understand that although Paraçuräma belonged to the brahminical group, he
circumstantially had to work as a kñatriya. Later, after finishing his work as a
kñatriya, he again became a brähmaëa and returned to Mahendra-parvata.
Similarly, we can see that although Viçvämitra was born in a kñatriya family,
by austerities and penances he achieved the position of a brähmaëa. These
histories confirm the statements in çästra that a brähmaëa may become a
kñatriya, a kñatriya may become a brähmaëa or vaiçya, and a vaiçya may become
a brähmaëa, by achieving the required qualities. One's status does not depend
upon birth. As confirmed in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (7.11.35) by Närada:
yasya yal lakñaëaà proktaà

yad anyaträpi dåçyeta
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com

tat tenaiva vinirdiçet
"If one shows the symptoms of being a brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya or çüdra, even
if he has appeared in a different class, he should be accepted according to those
symptoms of classification." To know who is a brähmaëa and who is a kñatriya,
one must consider a man's quality and work. If all the unqualified çüdras
become so-called brähmaëas and kñatriyas, social order will be impossible to
maintain. Thus there will be discrepancies, human society will turn into a
society of animals, and the situation all over the world will be hellish.

When requested by their father to accept Çunaùçepha as the eldest son, the
elder fifty of the Madhucchandäs, the sons of Viçvämitra, did not agree.
Therefore Viçvämitra, being angry, cursed them. "May all of you bad sons
become mlecchas," he said, "being opposed to the principles of Vedic culture."
PURPORT
In Vedic literature there are names like mleccha and yavana. The mlecchas
are understood to be those who do not follow the Vedic principles. In former
days, the mlecchas were fewer, and Viçvämitra Muni cursed his sons to become
mlecchas. But in the present age, Kali-yuga, there is no need of cursing, for
people are automatically mlecchas. This is only the beginning of Kali-yuga, but
at the end of Kali-yuga the entire population will consist of mlecchas because
no one will follow the Vedic principles. At that time the incarnation Kalki will

17. The Dynasties of the Sons of Purüravä
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
646
Äyu, the eldest son of Purüravä, had five sons. This chapter describes the
dynasties of four of them, beginning with Kñatravåddha.
Äyu, the son of Purüravä, had five sons- Nahuña, Kñatravåddha, Rajé, Räbha
and Anenä. The son of Kñatravåddha was Suhotra, who had three sons, named
Käçya, Kuça and Gåtsamada. The son of Gåtsamada was Çunaka, and his son
was Çaunaka. The son of Käçya was Käçi. From Käçi came the sons and
grandsons known as Räñöra, Dérghatama and then Dhanvantari, who was the
inaugurator of medical science and was a çaktyäveça incarnation of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Väsudeva. The descendants of Dhanvantari
were Ketumän, Bhémaratha, Divodäsa and Dyumän, who was also known as
Pratardana, Çatrujit, Vatsa, Åtadhvaja and Kuvalayäçva. The son of Dyumän
was Alarka, who reigned over the kingdom for many, many years. Following in
the dynasty of Alarka were Santati, Sunétha, Niketana, Dharmaketu,
Satyaketu, Dhåñöaketu, Sukumära, Vétihotra, Bharga and Bhärgabhümi. All of
them belonged to the dynasty of Käçi, the descendant of Kñatravåddha.
The son of Räbha was Rabhasa, and his son was Gambhéra. Gambhéra's son
was Akriya, and from Akriya came Brahmavit. The son of Anenä was Çuddha,
and his son was Çuci. The son of Çuci was Citrakåt, whose son was Çäntaraja.
Rajé had five hundred sons, all of extraordinary strength. Rajé was personally
very powerful and was given the kingdom of heaven by Lord Indra. Later, after
Rajé's death, when the sons of Rajé refused to return the kingdom to Indra, by
Båhaspati's arrangement they became unintelligent, and Lord Indra conquered
them.
The grandson of Kñatravåddha named Kuça gave birth to a son named Prati.
From Prati came Saïjaya; from Saïjaya, Jaya; from Jaya, Kåta; and from Kåta,
Haryabala. The son of Haryabala was Sahadeva; the son of Sahadeva, Héna;
the son of Héna, Jayasena; the son of Jayasena, Saìkåti; and the son of Saìkåti,
Jaya.

return it to the demigods?

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Seventeenth Chapter, of
the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Dynasties of the Sons of Purüravä."
18. King Yayäti Regains His Youth
This chapter gives the history of King Yayäti, the son of Nahuña. Among
Yayäti's five sons, the youngest son, Püru, accepted Yayäti's invalidity.
When Nahuña, who had six sons, was cursed to become a python, his eldest
son, Yati, took sannyäsa, and therefore the next son, Yayäti, was enthroned as
king. By providence, Yayäti married the daughter of Çukräcärya. Çukräcärya
was a brähmaëa and Yayäti a kñatriya, but Yayäti married her nonetheless.
Çukräcärya's daughter, named Devayäné, had a girl friend named Çarmiñöhä,
who was the daughter of Våñaparvä. King Yayäti married Çarmiñöhä also. The
history of this marriage is as follows. Once Çarmiñöhä was sporting in the water
with thousands of her girl friends, and Devayäné was also there. When the
young girls saw Lord Çiva, seated on his bull with Umä, they immediately
dressed themselves, but Çarmiñöhä mistakenly put on Devayäné's clothes.
Devayäné, being very angry, rebuked Çarmiñöhä, who also became very angry
and responded by rebuking Devayäné and throwing her into a well. By chance,
King Yayäti came to that well to drink water, and he found Devayäné and
rescued her. Thus Devayäné accepted Mahäräja Yayäti as her husband.
Thereafter, Devayäné, crying loudly, told her father about Çarmiñöhä's
behavior. Upon hearing of this incident, Çukräcärya was very angry and
wanted to chastise Våñaparvä, Çarmiñöhä's father. Våñaparvä, however, satisfied
Çukräcärya by offering Çarmiñöhä as Devayäné's maidservant. Thus Çarmiñöhä,
as the maidservant of Devayäné, also went to the house of Devayäné's husband.

661
When Çarmiñöhä found her friend Devayäné with a son she also desired to
have a son. Therefore, at the proper time for conception, she also requested
Mahäräja Yayäti for sex. When Çarmiñöhä became pregnant also, Devayäné was
very envious. In great anger, she immediately left for her father's house and
told her father everything. Çukräcärya again became angry and cursed
Mahäräja Yayäti to become old, but when Yayäti begged Çukräcärya to be
merciful to him, Çukräcärya gave him the benediction that he could transfer
his old age and invalidity to some young man. Yayäti exchanged his old age for
the youth of his youngest son, Püru, and thus he was able to enjoy with young
girls.

When one enters the post of king or head of the government, one cannot

Nahuña, did not accept the power to rule, although it was offered by his father.

PURPORT
Self-realization is the prime objective of human civilization, and it is
regarded seriously by those who are situated in the mode of goodness and have
developed the brahminical qualities. Kñatriyas are generally endowed with
material qualities conducive to gaining material wealth and enjoying sense
gratification, but those who are spiritually advanced are not interested in
material opulence. Indeed, they accept only the bare necessities for a life of
spiritual advancement in self-realization. It is specifically mentioned here that
if one enters political life, especially in the modern day, one looses the chance
for human perfection. Nonetheless, one can attain the highest perfection if
one hears Çrémad-Bhägavatam. This hearing is described as nityaà
bhägavata-sevayä [SB 1.2.18]. Mahäräja Parékñit was involved in politics, but
because at the end of his life he heard Çrémad-Bhägavatam from Çukadeva
Gosvämé, he attained perfection very easily. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu has
therefore suggested:
sthäne sthitäù çruti-gatäà tanu-väì-manobhir
ye präyaço 'jita jito 'py asi tais tri-lokyäm
(SB 10.14.3)
Regardless of whether one is in the mode of passion, ignorance or goodness, if
one regularly hears Çrémad-Bhägavatam from the self-realized soul, one is freed
from the bondage of material involvement.

Because Nahuña, the father of Yayäti, molested Indra's wife, Çacé, who then
complained to Agastya and other brähmaëas, these saintly brähmaëas cursed
Nahuña to fall from the heavenly planets and be degraded to the status of a
python. Consequently, Yayäti became the king.

Mahäräja Parékñit said: Çukräcärya was a very powerful brähmaëa, and
Mahäräja Yayäti was a kñatriya. Therefore I am curious to know how there
occurred this pratiloma marriage between a kñatriya and a brähmaëa.
PURPORT
According to the Vedic system, marriages between kñatriyas and kñatriyas or
between brähmaëas and brähmaëas are the general custom. If marriages
sometimes take place between different classes, these marriages are of two
types, namely anuloma and pratiloma. Anuloma, marriage between a brähmaëa
and the daughter of a kñatriya, is permissible, but pratiloma, marriage between
a kñatriya and the daughter of a brähmaëa, is not generally allowed. Therefore
Mahäräja Parékñit was curious about how Çukräcärya, a powerful brähmaëa,
could accept the principle of pratiloma. Mahäräja Parékñit was eager to know
the cause for this uncommon marriage.

of Vedic civilization, and because they are the only worshipable objects within

the directors of the various planets, and even by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, the Supersoul, the supreme purifier, the husband of the goddess of
fortune. And we are even more respectable because we are in the dynasty of
Bhågu. Yet although this woman's father, being among the demons, is our

Crows have no independent life; they fully depend on the remnants of
foodstuffs thrown by householders into the garbage tank. Therefore, because a
brähmaëa depends on his disciples, when Çarmiñöhä was heavily rebuked by
Devayäné she charged Devayäné with belonging to a family of crowlike beggars.
It is the nature of women to fight verbally at even a slight provocation. As we

TRANSLATION
With words saturated with love and affection, Devayäné said to King Yayäti:
O great hero, O King, conqueror of the cities of your enemies, by accepting my
hand you have accepted me as your married wife. Let me not be touched by
others, for our relationship as husband and wife has been made possible by
providence, not by any human being.
PURPORT
While taking Devayäné out of the well, King Yayäti must certainly have
appreciated her youthful beauty, and therefore he might have asked her which
caste she belonged to. Thus Devayäné would have immediately replied, "We are
already married because you have accepted my hand." Uniting the hands of

the bride and bridegroom is a system perpetually existing in all societies.
Therefore, as soon as Yayäti accepted Devayäné's hand, they could be regarded
as married. Because Devayäné was enamored with the hero Yayäti, she
requested him not to change his mind and let another come to marry her.

TRANSLATION
Because of falling in the well, I met you. Indeed, this has been arranged by
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com

providence. After I cursed Kaca, the son of the learned scholar Båhaspati, he
cursed me by saying that I would not have a brähmaëa for a husband.
Therefore, O mighty-armed one, there is no possibility of my becoming the wife
of a brähmaëa.
PURPORT
Kaca, the son of the learned celestial priest Båhaspati, had been a student of
Çukräcärya, from whom he had learned the art of reviving a man who has died
untimely. This art, called måta-saïjévané, was especially used during wartime.
When there was a war, soldiers would certainly die untimely, but if a soldier's
body was intact, he could be brought to life again by this art of måta-saïjévané.
This art was known to Çukräcärya and many others, and Kaca, the son of
Båhaspati, became Çukräcärya's student to learn it. Devayäné desired to have
Kaca as her husband, but Kaca, out of regard for Çukräcärya, looked upon the
guru's daughter as a respectable superior and therefore refused to marry her.
Devayäné angrily cursed Kaca by saying that although he had learned the art
of måta-saïjévané from her father, it would be useless. When cursed in this way,
Kaca retaliated by cursing Devayäné never to have a husband who was a
brähmaëa. Because Devayäné liked Yayäti, who was a kñatriya, she requested
him to accept her as his bona fide wife. Although this would be
pratiloma-viväha, a marriage between the daughter of a high family and the son
of a lower family, she explained that this arrangement was made by
providence.

TRANSLATION
Çukadeva Gosvämé continued: Because such a marriage is not sanctioned by
regular scriptures, King Yayäti did not like it, but because it was arranged by
providence and because he was attracted by Devayäné's beauty, he accepted her
request.
PURPORT
According to the Vedic system, the parents would consider the horoscopes
of the boy and girl who were to be married. If according to astrological
calculations the boy and girl were compatible in every respect, the match was
called yoöaka and the marriage would be accepted. Even fifty years ago, this
system was current in Hindu society. Regardless of the affluence of the boy or
the personal beauty of the girl, without this astrological compatibility the
marriage would not take place. A person is born in one of three categories,
known as deva-gaëa, manuñya-gaëa and rakñasa-gaëa. In different parts of the
universe there are demigods and demons, and in human society also some
people resemble demigods whereas others resemble demons. If according to
astrological calculations there was conflict between a godly and a demoniac
nature, the marriage would not take place. Similarly, there were calculations of
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
681
pratiloma and anuloma. The central idea is that if the boy and girl were on an
equal level the marriage would be happy, whereas inequality would lead to
unhappiness. Because care is no longer taken in marriage, we now find many
divorces. Indeed, divorce has now become a common affair, although formerly
one's marriage would continue lifelong, and the affection between husband
and wife was so great that the wife would voluntarily die when her husband
died or would remain a faithful widow throughout her entire life. Now, of
course, this is no longer possible, for human society has fallen to the level of
animal society. Marriage now takes place simply by agreement. Dämpatye
'bhirucir hetuù (SB 12.2.3). The word abhiruci means "agreement." If the boy
and girl simply agree to marry, the marriage takes place. But when the Vedic
system is not rigidly observed, marriage frequently ends in divorce.

As Çukräcärya listened to what had happened to Devayäné, his mind was
very much aggrieved. Condemning the profession of priesthood and praising the
profession of uïcha-våtti [collecting grains from the fields], he left home with
his daughter.
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com

PURPORT
When a brähmaëa adopts the profession of a kapota, or pigeon, he lives by
collecting grains from the field. This is called uïcha-våtti. A brähmaëa who
takes to this uïcha-våtti profession is called first class because he depends
completely on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and does not
beg from anyone. Although the profession of begging is allowed for a brähmaëa
or sannyäsé, one does better if he can avoid such a profession and completely
depend on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead for maintenance.
Çukräcärya was certainly very sorry that because of his daughter's complaint he
had to go to his disciple to beg some mercy, which he was obliged to do because
he had accepted the profession of priesthood. In his heart, Çukräcärya did not
like his profession, but since he had accepted it, he was obliged to go
unwillingly to his disciple to settle the grievance submitted by his daughter.

Devayäné, for she is my daughter and in this world I cannot give her up or
neglect her.
PURPORT
Sometimes a great personality like Çukräcärya cannot neglect sons and
daughters, for sons and daughters are by nature dependent on their father and
the father has affection for them. Although Çukräcärya knew that the quarrel
between Devayäné and Çarmiñöhä was childish, as Devayäné's father he had to
side with his daughter. He did not like to do this, but he was obliged to because
of affection. He plainly admitted that although he should not have asked the
King for mercy for his daughter, because of affection he could not avoid doing
so.

TRANSLATION
Våñaparvä wisely thought that Çukräcärya's displeasure would bring danger
and that his pleasure would bring material gain. Therefore he carried out
Çukräcärya's order and served him like a slave. He gave his daughter Çarmiñöhä
to Devayäné, and Çarmiñöhä served Devayäné like a slave, along with thousands
of other women.
PURPORT
In the beginning of these affairs concerning Çarmiñöhä and Devayäné, we
saw that Çarmiñöhä had many friends. Now these friends became maidservants
of Devayäné. When a girl married a kñatriya king, it was customary for all her
girl friends to go with her to her husband's house. For instance, when
Vasudeva married Devaké, the mother of Kåñëa, he married all six of her
sisters, and she also had many friends who accompanied her. A king would
maintain not only his wife but also the many friends and maidservants of his
wife. Some of these maidservants would become pregnant and give birth to
children. Such children were accepted as däsé-putra, the sons of the
maidservants, and the king would maintain them. The female population is
always greater than the male, but since a woman needs to be protected by a
man, the king would maintain many girls, who acted either as friends or as
maidservants of the queen. In the history of Kåñëa's household life we find that
Kåñëa married 16,108 wives. These were not maidservants but direct queens,
and Kåñëa expanded Himself into 16,108 forms to maintain different
establishments for each and every wife. This is not possible for ordinary men.
Therefore although the kings had to maintain many, many servants and wives,
not all of them had different establishments.

TRANSLATION
When Princess Çarmiñöhä begged King Yayäti for a son, the King was
certainly aware of the principles of religion, and therefore he agreed to fulfill
her desire. Although he remembered the warning of Çukräcärya, he thought of
this union as the desire of the Supreme, and thus he had sex with Çarmiñöhä.
PURPORT
King Yayäti was completely aware of the duty of a kñatriya. When a kñatriya
is approached by a woman, he cannot deny her. This is a religious principle.
Consequently, when Dharmaräja, Yudhiñöhira, saw Arjuna unhappy after
Arjuna returned from Dvärakä, he asked whether Arjuna had refused a
woman who had begged for a son. Although Mahäräja Yayäti remembered
Çukräcärya's warning, he could not refuse Çarmiñöhä. He thought it wise to
give her a son, and thus he had sexual intercourse with her after her menstrual
period. This kind of lust is not against religious principles. As stated in
Bhagavad-gétä (7.11), dharmäviruddho bhüteñu kämo 'smi: sex life not contrary
to the principles of religion is sanctioned by Kåñëa. Because Çarmiñöhä, the
daughter of a king, had begged Yayäti for a son, their combination was not lust
but an act of religion.

own daughter for Yayäti to continue in old age and invalidity, for certainly his
lusty daughter would not be satisfied. Therefore Çukräcärya blessed his
son-in-law by saying that he could exchange his old age for someone else's
youth. He indicated that if Yayäti's son would exchange his youth for Yayäti's

My dear son, I am not yet satisfied in my sexual desires. But if you are kind
to me, you can take the old age given by your maternal grandfather, and I may
take your youth so that I may enjoy life for a few years more.
PURPORT
This is the nature of lusty desires. In Bhagavad-gétä (7.20) it is said, kämais
tais tair håta jïänäù: when one is too attached to sense gratification, he
actually loses his sense. The word håta jïänäù refers to one who has lost his
sense. Here is an example: the father shamelessly asked his son to exchange
youth for old age. Of course, the entire world is under such illusion. Therefore
it is said that everyone is pramattaù, or exclusively mad. Nünaà pramattaù
kurute vikarma: [SB 5.5.4] when one becomes almost like a madman, he
indulges in sex and sense gratification. Sex and sense gratification can be
controlled, however, and one achieves perfection when he has no desires for
sex. This is possible only when one is fully Kåñëa conscious.

"Since I have been engaged in the transcendental loving service of Kåñëa,
realizing ever-new pleasure in Him, whenever I think of sex pleasure, I spit at
the thought, and my lips curl with distaste." Sexual desire can be stopped only
when one is fully Kåñëa conscious, and not otherwise. As long as one has
desires for sex, one must change his body and transmigrate from one body to
another to enjoy sex in different species or forms. But although the forms may
differ, the business of sex is the same. Therefore it is said, punaù punaç
carvita-carvaëänäm [SB 7.5.30]. Those who are very much attached to sex
transmigrate from one body to another, with the same business of "chewing the
chewed," tasting sex enjoyment as a dog, sex enjoyment as a hog, sex
enjoyment as a demigod, and so on.

TRANSLATION
Yadu replied: My dear father, you have already achieved old age, although
you also were a young man. But I do not welcome your old age and invalidity,
for unless one enjoys material happiness, one cannot attain renunciation.
PURPORT
Renunciation of material enjoyment is the ultimate goal of human life.
Therefore the varëäçrama institution is most scientific. It aims at giving one
the facility to return home, back to Godhead, which one cannot do without
completely renouncing all connections with the material world. Çré Caitanya
Mahäprabhu said, niñkiïcanasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukhasya: one who wants
to go back home, back to Godhead, must be niñkiïcana, free from all affinity
for material enjoyment. Brahmaëy upaçamäçrayam: unless one is fully
renounced, one cannot engage in devotional service or stay in Brahman.
Devotional service is rendered on the Brahman platform. Therefore, unless
one attains the Brahman platform, or spiritual platform, one cannot engage in
devotional service; or, in other words, a person engaged in devotional service is
already on the Brahman platform.
mäà ca yo 'vyabhicäreëa

"One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any

699
circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes
to the level of Brahman." (Bg. 14.26) If one attains devotional service,
therefore, he is certainly liberated. Generally, unless one enjoys material
happiness, one cannot attain renunciation. Varëäçrama therefore gives the
opportunity for gradual elevation. Yadu, the son of Mahäräja Yayäti, explained
that he was unable to give up his youth, for he wanted to use it to attain the
renounced order in the future.
Mahäräja Yadu was different from his brothers. As stated in the next verse,
turvasuç coditaù piträ druhyuç cänuç ca bhärata/ pratyäcakhyur adharmajïäù.
Mahäräja Yadu's brothers refused to accept their father's proposal because they
were not completely aware of dharma. To accept orders that follow religious
principles, especially the orders of one's father, is very important. Therefore
when the brothers of Mahäräja Yadu refused their father's order, this was
certainly irreligious. Mahäräja Yadu's refusal, however, was religious. As stated
in the Tenth Canto, yadoç ca dharma-çéläya: Mahäräja Yadu was completely
aware of the principles of religion. The ultimate principle of religion is to
engage oneself in devotional service to the Lord. Mahäräja Yadu was very
eager to engage himself in the Lord's service, but there was an impediment:
during youth the material desire to enjoy the material senses is certainly
present, and unless one fully satisfies these lusty desires in youth, there is a
chance of one's being disturbed in rendering service to the Lord. We have
actually seen that many sannyäsés who accept sannyäsa prematurely, not
having satisfied their material desires, fall down because they are disturbed.
Therefore the general process is to go through gåhastha life and vänaprastha
life and finally come to sannyäsa and devote oneself completely to the service
of the Lord. Mahäräja Yadu was ready to accept his father's order and
exchange youth for old age because he was confident that the youth taken by
his father would be returned. But because this exchange would delay his
complete engagement in devotional service, he did not want to accept his
father's old age, for he was eager to achieve freedom from disturbances.
Moreover, among the descendants of Yadu would be Lord Kåñëa. Therefore,
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
700
because Yadu was eager to see the Lord's appearance in his dynasty as soon as
possible, Yadu refused to accept his father's proposal. This was not irreligious,
however, because Yadu's purpose was to serve the Lord. Because Yadu was a
faithful servant of the Lord, Lord Kåñëa appeared in his dynasty. As confirmed
in the prayers of Kunté, yadoù priyasyänvaväye. Yadu was very dear to Kåñëa,
who was therefore eager to descend in Yadu's dynasty. In conclusion, Mahäräja
Yadu should not be considered adharma jïa, ignorant of religious principles, as
the next verse designates his brothers. He was like the four Sanakas
(catuù-sana), who refused the order of their father, Brahmä, for the sake of a
better cause. Because the four Kumäras wanted to engage themselves
completely in the service of the Lord as brahmacärés, their refusal to obey their
father's order was not irreligious.

The father gives the seed of the body, and this seed gradually grows and
develops until one ultimately attains the developed human body, with
consciousness higher than that of the animals. In the human body one can be
elevated to the higher planets, and, furthermore, if one cultivates Kåñëa

consciousness, one can return home, back to Godhead. This important human
body is obtained by the grace of the father, and therefore everyone is indebted
to his father. Of course, in other lives one also gets a father and mother; even
cats and dogs have fathers and mothers. But in the human form of life the
father and mother can award their son the greatest benediction by teaching
him to become a devotee. When one becomes a devotee, he achieves the
greatest benediction because he completely averts the repetition of birth and
death. Therefore the father who trains his child in Kåñëa consciousness is the
most benevolent father in this world. It is said:
janame janame sabe pitä mätä päya
kåñëa guru nahi mile bhaja hari ei
Everyone gets a father and mother, but if one gets the benediction of Kåñëa
and guru, he can conquer material nature and return home, back to Godhead.

the father.
TRANSLATION
A son who acts by anticipating what his father wants him to do is first class,
one who acts upon receiving his father's order is second class, and one who
executes his father's order irreverently is third class. But a son who refuses his
father's order is like his father's stool.
PURPORT
Püru, Yayäti's last son, immediately accepted his father's proposal, for
although he was the youngest, he was very qualified. Püru thought, "I should
have accepted my father's proposal before he asked, but I did not. Therefore I
am not a first-class son. I am second class. But I do not wish to become the
lowest type of son, who is compared to his father's stool." One Indian poet has
spoken of putra and mütra. putra means "son," and mütra means "urine." Both a
son and urine come from the same genitals. If a son is an obedient devotee of
the Lord he is called putra, or a real son; otherwise, if he is not learned and is
not a devotee, a son is nothing better than urine.

soul is very rare." The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Väsudeva, is one with
the Supreme Brahman, the Supreme Absolute Truth. Everything is in Him in
the beginning, and at the end all manifestations enter into Him. He is situated
in everyone's heart (sarvasya cähaà hådi sanniviñöaù [Bg. 15.15]). And from Him
everything has emanated (janmädy asya yataù [SB 1.1.1]). All material
manifestations, however, are temporary. The word svapna means "dreams,"
mäyä means "illusion," and manoratha means "mental creations." Dreams,
illusions and mental creations are temporary. Similarly, all material creation is
temporary, but Väsudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the eternal
Absolute Truth.

TRANSLATION
Although Mahäräja Yayäti was the king of the entire world and he engaged
his mind and five senses in enjoying material possessions for one thousand
years, he was unable to be satisfied.
PURPORT
The kad-indriya, or unpurified senses, can be purified if one engages the
senses and the mind in Kåñëa consciousness. Sarvopädhi-vinirmuktaà
tat-paratvena nirmalam [Cc. Madhya 19.170]. One must be freed from all
designations. When one identifies himself with the material world, his senses
are impure. But when one achieves spiritual realization and identifies himself
as a servant of the Lord, his senses are purified immediately. Engagement of
the purified senses in the service of the Lord is called bhakti. Håñékeëa
håñékeça-sevanaà bhaktir ucyate. One may enjoy the senses for many thousands
of years, but unless one purifies the senses, one cannot be happy.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Eighteenth Chapter, of
the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "King Yayäti Regains His Youth."
19. King Yayäti Achieves Liberation
This Nineteenth Chapter describes how Mahäräja Yayäti achieved
liberation after he recounted the figurative story of the he-goat and she-goat.
After many, many years of sexual relationships and enjoyment in the
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
712
material world, King Yayäti finally became disgusted with such materialistic
happiness. When satiated with material enjoyment, he devised a story of a
he-goat and she-goat, corresponding to his own life, and narrated the story
before his beloved Devayäné. The story is as follows. Once upon a time, while a
goat was searching in a forest for different types of vegetables to eat, by chance
he came to a well, in which he saw a she-goat. He became attracted to this
she-goat and somehow or other delivered her from the well, and thus they were
united. One day thereafter, when the she-goat saw the he-goat enjoying sex
with another she-goat, she became angry, abandoned the he-goat, and
returned to her brähmaëa owner, to whom she described her husband's
behavior. The brähmaëa became very angry and cursed the he-goat to lose his
sexual power. Thereupon, the he-goat begged the brähmaëa's pardon and was
given back the power for sex. Then the he-goat enjoyed sex with the she-goat
for many years, but still he was not satisfied. If one is lusty and greedy, even
the total stock of gold in this world cannot satisfy one's lusty desires. These
desires are like a fire. One may pour clarified butter on a blazing fire, but one
cannot expect the fire to be extinguished. To extinguish such a fire, one must
adopt a different process. The çästra therefore advises that by intelligence one
renounce the life of enjoyment. Without great endeavor, those with a poor
fund of knowledge cannot give up sense enjoyment, especially in relation to
sex, because a beautiful woman bewilders even the most learned man. King
Yayäti, however, renounced worldly life and divided his property among his
sons. He personally adopted the life of a mendicant, or sannyäsé, giving up all
attraction to material enjoyment, and engaged himself fully in devotional
service to the Lord. Thus he attained perfection. Later, when his beloved wife,
Devayäné, was freed from her mistaken way of life, she also engaged herself in
the devotional service of the Lord.

My dearly beloved wife, daughter of Çukräcärya, in this world there was
someone exactly like me. Please listen as I narrate the history of his life. By
hearing about the life of such a householder, those who have retired from
householder life always lament.
PURPORT
Persons who live in the village or town are called gräma-niväsé, and those
who live in the forest are called vana-väsé or vänaprastha. The vänaprasthas,
who have retired from family life, generally lament about their past family life
because it engaged them in trying to fulfill lusty desires. Prahläda Mahäräja
said that one should retire from family life as soon as possible, and he described
family life as the darkest well (hitvätma-pätaà gåham andha-küpam). If one
continuously or permanently concentrates on living with his family, he should
be understood to be killing himself. In the Vedic civilization, therefore, it is
recommended that one retire from family life at the end of his fiftieth year
and go to vana, the forest. When he becomes expert or accustomed to forest
life, or retired life as a vänaprastha, he should accept sannyäsa. Vanaà gato yad
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
715
dharim äçrayeta [SB 7.5.5]. Sannyäsa means accepting unalloyed engagement in
the service of the Lord. Vedic civilization therefore recommends four different
stages of life-brahmacarya, gåhastha, vänaprastha and sannyäsa. One should be
very much ashamed of remaining a householder and not promoting oneself to
the two higher stages, namely vänaprastha and sannyäsa.

While wandering in the forest, eating to satisfy his senses, a he-goat by
chance approached a well, in which he saw a she-goat standing helplessly,
having fallen into it by the influence of the results of fruitive activities.
PURPORT
Here Mahäräja Yayäti compares himself to a he-goat and Devayäné to a
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
716
she-goat and describes the nature of man and woman. Like a he-goat, a man
searches for sense gratification, wandering here and there, and a woman
without the shelter of a man or husband is like a she-goat that has fallen into a
well. Without being cared for by a man, a woman cannot be happy. Indeed, she
is just like a she-goat that has fallen into a well and is struggling for existence.
Therefore a woman must take shelter of her father, as Devayäné did when
under the care of Çukräcärya, and then the father must give the daughter in
charity to a suitable man, or a suitable man should help the woman by placing
her under the care of a husband. This is shown vividly by the life of Devayäné.
When King Yayäti delivered Devayäné from the well, she felt great relief and
requested Yayäti to accept her as his wife. But when Mahäräja Yayäti accepted
Devayäné, he became too attached and had sex life not only with her but with
others, like Çarmiñöhä. Yet still he was dissatisfied. Therefore one should retire
by force from such family life as Yayäti's. When one is fully convinced of the
degrading nature of worldly family life, one should completely renounce this
way of life, take sannyäsa, and engage himself fully in the service of the Lord.
Then one's life will be successful.

TRANSLATION
After planning how to get the she-goat out of the well, the lusty he-goat dug
up the earth on the well's edge with the point of his horns in such a way that
she was able to come out very easily.
PURPORT
Attraction for woman is the impetus for economic development, housing
and many other things meant for living comfortably in this material world.
Digging up the earth to make a way out for the she-goat was a laborious task,
but before accepting the she-goat, the he-goat underwent this labor. Ato
gåha-kñetra-sutäpta-vittair janasya moho 'yam ahaà mameti [SB 5.5.8]. The
union between male and female provides the impetus for gaining a nice
apartment, a good income, children and friends. Thus one becomes entangled
in this material world.

TRANSLATION
When the she-goat, who had very nice hips, got out of the well and saw the
very handsome he-goat, she desired to accept him as her husband. When she did
so, many other she-goats also desired him as their husband because he had a

719
very beautiful bodily structure and a nice mustache and beard and was expert in
discharging semen and in the art of sexual intercourse. Therefore, just as a
person haunted by a ghost exhibits madness, the best of the he-goats, attracted
by the many she-goats, engaged in erotic activities and naturally forgot his real
business of self-realization.
PURPORT
Materialists are certainly very much attracted by sexual intercourse. Yan
maithunädi-gåhamedhi-sukhaà hi tuccham [SB 7.9.45]. Although one becomes a
gåhastha, or householder, to enjoy sex life to his heart's content, one is never
satisfied. Such a lusty materialist is like a goat, for it is said that if goats meant
for slaughter get the opportunity, they enjoy sex before being killed. Human
beings, however, are meant for self-realization.
tapo divyaà putrakä yena sattvaà
çuddhyed yasmäd brahma-saukhyaà tv anantam
[SB 5.5.1]
Human life is meant for realization of the self, the spiritual soul within the
body (dehino 'smin yathä dehe [Bg. 2.13]). A materialistic rascal does not know
that he is not the body but a spiritual soul within the body. However, one
should understand his real position and cultivate knowledge by which to get
free from bodily entanglement. Like an unfortunate person who acts madly,
haunted by ghosts, a materialist haunted by the ghost of lust forgets his real
business so that he can enjoy so-called happiness in the bodily concept of life.

sensuality; utsåjya—giving up; sväminam—to her present husband, or to the
former maintainer; duùkhitä—being very much aggrieved; yayau—she left.
TRANSLATION
Aggrieved by her husband's behavior with another, the she-goat thought
that the he-goat was not actually her friend but was hardhearted and was her
friend only for the time being. Therefore, because her husband was lusty, she
left him and returned to her former maintainer.
PURPORT
The word sväminam is significant. Svämé means "caretaker" or "master."
Devayäné was cared for by Çukräcärya before her marriage, and after her
marriage she was cared for by Yayäti, but here the word sväminam indicates
that Devayäné left the protection of her husband, Yayäti, and returned to her
former protector, Çukräcärya. Vedic civilization recommends that a woman
stay under the protection of a man. During childhood she should be cared for
by her father, in youth by her husband, and in old age by a grown son. In any
stage of life, a woman should not have independence.

TRANSLATION
The she-goat went to the residence of a brähmaëa who was the maintainer of
another she-goat, and that brähmaëa angrily cut off the he-goat's dangling
testicles. But at the he-goat's request, the brähmaëa later rejoined them by the
power of mystic yoga.
PURPORT
Here Çukräcärya is figuratively described as the husband of another
she-goat. This indicates that the relationship between husband and wife in any
society, whether higher or lower than human society, is nothing but the same
relationship between he-goat and she-goat, for the material relationship
between man and woman is one of sex. Yan maithunädi-gåhamedhi-sukhaà hi
tuccham [SB 7.9.45]. Çukräcärya was an äcärya, or expert, in family affairs,
which involve the transfer of semen from he-goat to she-goat, The words
kaçcid ajä-svämé expressly indicate herein that Çukräcärya was no better than
Yayäti, for both of them were interested in family affairs generated by çukra, or
semen. Çukräcärya first cursed Yayäti to become old so that he could no longer
indulge in sex, but when Çukräcärya saw that Yayäti's emasculation would
make his own daughter a victim of punishment, he used his mystic power to
restore Yayäti's masculinity. Because he used his power of mystic yoga for
family affairs and not to realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this
exercise in the magic of yoga was no better than the affairs of he-goats and
she-goats. Yogic power should properly be used to realize the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. As the Lord Himself recommends in Bhagavad-gétä

PURPORT
When one is bound by affection for one's wife, one is attached to sexual
desires that are very difficult to overcome. Therefore, according to Vedic
civilization, one must voluntarily leave his so-called home and go to the forest.
Païcäçordhvaà vanaà vrajet. Human life is meant for such tapasya, or
austerity. By the austerity of voluntarily stopping sex life at home and going to
the forest to engage in spiritual activities in the association of devotees, one
achieves the actual purpose of human life.

PURPORT
If one remains a victim of the so-called beauty of his wife, his family life is
nothing but a dark well. Hitvätma-pätaà gåham andha-küpam. Existence in
such a dark well is certainly suicidal. If one wants relief from the miserable
condition of material life, one must voluntarily give up his lusty relationship
with his wife; otherwise there is no question of self-realization. Unless one is
extremely advanced in spiritual consciousness, household life is nothing but a
dark well in which one commits suicide. Prahläda Mahäräja therefore
recommended that in due time, at least after one's fiftieth year, one must give
up household life and go to the forest. Vanaà gato yad dharim äçrayeta [SB
7.5.5]. There one should seek shelter at the lotus feet of Hari.

A person who is lusty cannot satisfy his mind even if he has enough of
everything in this world, including rice, barley and other food grains, gold,
animals and women. Nothing can satisfy him.
PURPORT
Improvement of one's economic condition is the aim and object of a
materialist, but there is no end to this material advancement, for if one cannot
control his lusty desires, he will never be pleased, even if he gets all the
material wealth of the world. In this age we see much material improvement,
but still people are struggling to get more and more material opulence. Manaù
ñañöhänéndriyäëi prakåti-sthäni karñati [Bg. 15.7]. Although every living entity is
a part of the Supreme Being, because of lusty desires one continuously
struggles for so-called betterment of one's economic condition. To have a
satisfied mind, one must give up his heart disease of lusty desires. This can be
done only when one is Kåñëa conscious.

If one becomes Kåñëa conscious, then he can give up this heart disease;
otherwise this disease of lusty desires will continue, and one cannot have peace
in his mind.

As supplying butter to a fire does not diminish the fire but instead increases
it more and more, the endeavor to stop lusty desires by continual enjoyment can
never be successful. [In fact, one must voluntarily cease from material desires.]
PURPORT
One may have enough money and enough resources to satisfy the senses but
still not be satisfied, for the endeavor to stop lusty desires by enjoying can
never be successful. The example given here is very appropriate. One cannot
stop a blazing fire by trying to extinguish it with butter.

PURPORT
Prabodhänanda Sarasvaté said, viçvaà pürëa-sukhäyate: when one becomes
Kåñëa conscious by the mercy of Lord Caitanya, for him the entire world
appears happy, and he has nothing for which to hanker. On the brahma-bhüta
[SB 4.30.20] stage, or the platform of spiritual realization, there is no
lamentation and no material hankering (na çocati na käìkñati [Bg. 18.54]). As
long as one lives in the material world, actions and reactions will continue, but
when one is unaffected by such material actions and reactions, he is to be
considered free from the danger of being victimized by material desires. The
symptoms of those who are satiated with lusty desires are described in this

verse. As explained by Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura, when one is not
envious even of his enemy, does not expect honor from anyone, but instead
desires all well-being even for his enemy, he is understood to be a
paramahaàsa, one who has fully subdued the lusty desires for sense
gratification.

TRANSLATION
For those who are too attached to material enjoyment, sense gratification is
very difficult to give up. Even when one is an invalid because of old age, one
cannot give up such desires for sense gratification. Therefore, one who actually
desires happiness must give up such unsatisfied desires, which are the cause of

731
all tribulations.
PURPORT
We have actually seen, especially in the Western countries, that men who
have reached more than eighty years of age still go to nightclubs and pay heavy
fees to drink wine and associate with women. Although such men are too old
to enjoy anything, their desires have not ceased. Time deteriorates even the
body itself, which is the medium for all sensual satisfaction, but even when a
man becomes old and invalid, his desires are strong enough to dictate that he
go here and there to satisfy the desires of his senses. Therefore, by the practice
of bhakti-yoga, one should give up his lusty desires. As explained by Çré
Yämunäcärya:
yad-avadhi mama cetaù kåñëa-pädäravinde
nava-nava-rasa-dhämany udyataà rantum äsét
tad-avadhi bata näré-saìgame smaryamäne

When one is Kåñëa conscious, he gets more and more happiness by discharging
duties for Kåñëa. Such a person spits on sense gratification, especially that of
sexual enjoyment. An experienced, advanced devotee is no longer interested
in sex life. The strong desire for sex can be subdued only by advancement in
Kåñëa consciousness.

TRANSLATION
One should not allow oneself to sit on the same seat even with one's own
mother, sister or daughter, for the senses are so strong that even though one is
very advanced in knowledge, he may be attracted by sex.
PURPORT
Learning the etiquette of how to deal with women does not free one from
sexual attraction. As specifically mentioned herewith, such attraction is
possible even with one's mother, sister or daughter. Generally, of course, one is
not sexually attracted to his mother, sister or daughter, but if one allows
himself to sit very close to such a woman, one may be attracted. This is a
psychological fact. It may be said that one is liable to be attracted if he is not
very advanced in civilized life; however, as specifically mentioned here,
vidväàsam api karñati: even if one is highly advanced, materially or spiritually,
he may be attracted by lusty desires. The object of attraction may even be one's
mother, sister or daughter. Therefore, one should be extremely careful in
dealings with women. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu was most strict in such
dealings, especially after He accepted the sannyäsa order. Indeed, no woman
could come near Him to offer Him respect. Again, one is warned herewith that
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
733
one should be extremely careful in dealings with women. A brahmacäré is
forbidden even to see the wife of his spiritual master if she happens to be
young. The wife of the spiritual master may sometimes take some service from
the disciple of her husband, as she would from a son, but if the wife of the
spiritual master is young, a brahmacäré is forbidden to render service to her.

Therefore, I shall now give up all these desires and meditate upon the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Free from the dualities of mental concoction
and free from false prestige, I shall wander in the forest with the animals.
PURPORT
To go to the forest and live there with the animals, meditating upon the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the only means by which to give up lusty
desires. Unless one gives up such desires, one's mind cannot be freed from
material contamination. Therefore, if one is at all interested in being freed
from the bondage of repeated birth, death, old age and disease, after a certain

735
age one must go to the forest. païcäçordhvaà vanaà vrajet. After fifty years of
age, one should voluntarily give up family life and go to the forest. The best
forest is Våndävana, where one need not live with the animals but can
associate with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who never leaves
Våndävana. Cultivating Kåñëa consciousness in Våndävana is the best means
of being liberated from material bondage, for in Våndävana one can
automatically meditate upon Kåñëa. Våndävana has many temples, and in one
or more of these temples one may see the form of the Supreme Lord as
Rädhä-Kåñëa or Kåñëa-Balaräma and meditate upon this form. As expressed
here by the words brahmaëy adhyäya, one should concentrate one's mind upon
the Supreme Lord, Parabrahman. This Parabrahman is Kåñëa, as confirmed by
Arjuna in Bhagavad-gétä (paraà brahma paraà dhäma pavitraà paramaà
bhavän [Bg. 10.12]). Kåñëa and His abode, Våndävana, are not different. Çré
Caitanya Mahäprabhu said, ärädhyo bhagavän vrajeça-tanayas tad-dhäma
våndävanam. Våndävana is as good as Kåñëa. Therefore, if one somehow or
other gets the opportunity to live in Våndävana, and if one is not a pretender
but simply lives in Våndävana and concentrates his mind upon Kåñëa, one is
liberated from material bondage. One's mind is not purified, however, even in
Våndävana, if one is agitated by lusty desires. One should not live in
Våndävana and commit offenses, for a life of offenses in Våndävana is no
better than the lives of the monkeys and hogs there. Many monkeys and hogs
live in Våndävana, and they are concerned with their sexual desires. Men who
have gone to Våndävana but who still hanker for sex should immediately leave
Våndävana and stop their grievous offenses at the lotus feet of the Lord. There
are many misguided men who live in Våndävana to satisfy their sexual desires,
but they are certainly no better than the monkeys and hogs. Those who are
under the control of mäyä, and specifically under the control of lusty desires,
are called mäyä-måga. Indeed, everyone in the conditional stage of material life
is a mäyä-måga. It is said, mäyä-mågaà dayitayepsitam anvadhävad: [SB 11.5.34]
Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu took sannyäsa to show His causeless mercy to the
mäyä-mågas, the people of this material world, who suffer because of lusty

736
desires. One should follow the principles of Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu and
always think of Kåñëa in full Kåñëa consciousness. Then one will be eligible to
live in Våndävana, and his life will be successful.

737
things, is the knower of the self. Such a self-realized person knows quite well
that material happiness is the very cause of continued material existence and
forgetfulness of one's own constitutional position.
PURPORT
The living entity is a spiritual soul, and the material body is his
encagement. This is the beginning of spiritual understanding.
dehino 'smin yathä dehe
kaumäraà yauvanaà jarä

"As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth
to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The
self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change." (Bg. 2.13) The real
mission of human life is to get free from encagement in the material body.
Therefore Kåñëa descends to teach the conditioned soul about spiritual
realization and how to become free from material bondage. Yadä yadä hi
dharmasya glänir bhavati bhärata [Bg. 4.7]. The words dharmasya gläniù mean
"pollution of one's existence." Our existence is now polluted, and it must be
purified (sattvaà çuddhyet). The human life is meant for this purification, not
for thinking of happiness in terms of the external body, which is the cause of
material bondage. Therefore, in this verse, Mahäräja Yayäti advises that
whatever material happiness we see and whatever is promised for enjoyment is
all merely flickering and temporary. Äbrahma-bhuvanäl lokäù punar ävartino
'rjuna [Bg. 8.16]. Even if one is promoted to Brahmaloka, if one is not freed
from material bondage one must return to this planet earth and continue in
the miserable condition of material existence (bhütvä bhütvä praléyate) [Bg.
8.19]. One should always keep this understanding in mind so as not to be
allured by any kind of sense enjoyment, in this life or in the next. One who is
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
738
fully aware of this truth is self-realized (sa ätma-dåk), but aside from him,
everyone suffers in the cycle of birth and death (måtyu-saàsära-vartmani [Bg.
9.3]). This understanding is one of true intelligence, and anything contrary to
this is but a cause of unhappiness. Kåñëa-bhakta-niñkäma, ataeva 'çänta.' [Cc.
Madhya 19.149] Only a Kåñëa conscious person, who knows the aim and object
of life, is peaceful. All others, whether karmés, jïänés or yogés, are restless and
cannot enjoy real peace.

Having enjoyed sense gratification for many, many years, O King Parékñit,

PURPORT
That Mahäräja Yayäti was immediately liberated from the bondage of
conditioned life is certainly astonishing. But the example given herewith is
appropriate. A tiny baby bird, dependent fully on its father and mother even
to eat, suddenly flies away from the nest when its wings have grown. Similarly,
if one fully surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is
immediately liberated from the bondage of conditioned life, as promised by the
Lord Himself (ahaà tväà sarva-päpebhyo mokñayiñyämi [Bg. 18.66]). As stated
in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (2.4.18):
kiräta-hüëändhra-pulinda-pulkaçä

my respectful obeisances unto Him." Lord Viñëu is so powerful that He can
deliver anyone at once if He is pleased to do so. And Lord Viñëu, the Supreme

742
Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, can be pleased immediately if we accept His
order by surrendering unto Him, as Mahäräja Yayäti did. Mahäräja Yayäti was
eager to serve Väsudeva, Kåñëa, and therefore as soon as he wanted to
renounce material life, Lord Väsudeva helped him. We must therefore be very
sincere in surrendering ourselves unto the lotus feet of the Lord. Then we can
immediately be liberated from all the bondage of conditioned life. This is
clearly expressed in the next verse.

TRANSLATION
Because King Yayäti completely surrendered unto the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, Väsudeva, he was freed from all contamination of the material
modes of nature. Because of his self-realization, he was able to fix his mind
upon the Transcendence [Parabrahman, Väsudeva], and thus he ultimately
achieved the position of an associate of the Lord.
PURPORT
The word vidhuta, meaning "cleansed," is very significant. Everyone in this
material world is contaminated (käraëaà guëa-saìgo 'sya [Bg. 13.22]). Because
we are in a material condition, we are contaminated either by sattva-guëa, by
rajo-guëa or by tamo-guëa. Even if one becomes a qualified brähmaëa in the
mode of goodness (sattva-guëa), he is still materially contaminated. One must
come to the platform of çuddha-sattva, transcending the sattva-guëa. Then one
is vidhuta-triliìga, cleansed of the contamination caused by the three modes of
material nature. This is possible by the mercy of Kåñëa. As stated in
Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.2.17):

everyone's heart and the benefactor of the truthful devotee, cleanses desire for

words of Kåñëa from Çrémad-Bhägavatam or Bhagavad-gétä certainly has all the
dirty things cleansed from the core of his heart. Caitanya Mahäprabhu also
says, ceto-darpaëa-märjanam: [Cc. Antya 20.12] the process of hearing and
chanting the glories of the Supreme Lord washes away the dirty things
accumulated in the core of the heart. As soon as one is freed from all the dirt
of material contamination, as Mahäräja Yayäti was, one's original position as
an associate of the Lord is revealed. This is called svarüpa-siddhi(4), or personal
perfection.

of Mahäräja Yayäti; mene—understood; prastobham ätmanaù—when
instructed for her self-realization; stré-puàsoù—between the husband and

TRANSLATION
When Devayäné heard Mahäräja Yayäti's story of the he-goat and she-goat,
she understood that this story, which was presented as if a funny joke for

entertainment between husband and wife, was intended to awaken her to her
constitutional position.
PURPORT
When one actually awakens from material life, one understands his real
position as an eternal servant of Kåñëa. This is called liberation. Muktir
hitvänyathä rüpaà svarüpeëa vyavasthitiù (SB 2.10.6). Under the influence of
mäyä, everyone living in this material world thinks that he is the master of
everything (ahaìkära-vimüòhätmä kartäham iti manyate [Bg. 3.27]). One thinks
that there is no God or controller and that one is independent and can do
anything. This is the material condition, and when one awakens from this
ignorance, he is called liberated. Mahäräja Yayäti had delivered Devayäné from
the well, and finally, as a dutiful husband, he instructed her with the story
about the he-goat and she-goat and thus delivered her from the misconception
of material happiness. Devayäné was quite competent to understand her
liberated husband, and therefore she decided to follow him as his faithful wife.

TRANSLATION
Thereafter, Devayäné, the daughter of Çukräcärya, understood that the
materialistic association of husband, friends and relatives is like the association
in a hotel full of tourists. The relationships of society, friendship and love are
created by the mäyä of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, exactly as in a
dream. By the grace of Kåñëa, Devayäné gave up her imaginary position in the
material world. Completely fixing her mind upon Kåñëa, she achieved liberation
from the gross and subtle bodies.

One should be convinced that he is a spirit soul, part and parcel of the

material coverings of the gross and subtle bodies, consisting of earth, water,
fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego. One should know that the
association of society, friendship, love, nationalism, religion and so on are
nothing but creations of mäyä. One's only business is to become Kåñëa
conscious and render service unto Kåñëa as extensively as possible for a living
being. In this way one is liberated from material bondage. By the grace of
Kåñëa, Devayäné attained this state through the instructions of her husband.

PURPORT
How Devayäné became self-realized by the grace of her great husband,
Mahäräja Yayäti, is described here. Describing such realization is another way
of performing the bhakti process.
çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù
smaraëaà päda-sevanam
arcanaà vandanaà däsyaà
sakhyam ätma-nivedanam
"Hearing and chanting about the transcendental holy name, form, qualities,
paraphernalia and pastimes of Lord Viñëu, remembering them, serving the
lotus feet of the Lord, offering the Lord respectful worship, offering prayers to
the Lord, becoming His servant, considering the Lord one's best friend, and
surrendering everything unto Him-these nine processes are accepted as pure
devotional service." (SB 7.5.23) çravaëaà kértanam, hearing and chanting, are
especially important. By hearing from her husband about the greatness of Lord
Väsudeva, Devayäné certainly became convinced and surrendered herself unto
the lotus feet of the Lord (oà namo bhagavate väsudeväya). This is knowledge.
Bahünäà janmanäm ante jïänavän mäà prapadyate [Bg. 7.19]. Surrender to
Väsudeva is the result of hearing about Him for many, many births. As soon as
one surrenders unto Väsudeva, one is liberated immediately. Because of her
association with her great husband, Mahäräja Yayäti, Devayäné became
purified, adopted the means of bhakti-yoga, and thus became liberated.

the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "King Yayäti Achieves Liberation."
20. The Dynasty of Püru
This chapter describes the history of Püru and his descendant Duñmanta.
The son of Püru was Janamejaya, and his son was Pracinvän. The sons and
grandsons in the line of Pracinvän, one after another, were Pravéra, Manusyu,
Cärupada, Sudyu, Bahugava, Saàyäti, Ahaàyäti and Raudräçva. Raudräçva
had ten sons-Åteyu, Kakñeyu, Sthaëòileyu, Kåteyuka, Jaleyu, Sannateyu,
Dharmeyu, Satyeyu, Vrateyu and Vaneyu. The son of Åteyu was Rantinäva,
who had three sons-Sumati, Dhruva and Apratiratha. The son of Apratiratha
was Kaëva, and Kaëva's son was Medhätithi. The sons of Medhätithi, headed
by Praskanna, were all brähmaëas. The son of Rantinäva named Sumati had a
son named Rebhi, and his son was Duñmanta.
While hunting in the forest, Duñmanta once approached the äçrama of
Mahäåñi Kaëva, where he saw an extremely beautiful woman and became
attracted to her. That woman was the daughter of Viçvämitra, and her name
was Çakuntalä. Her mother was Menakä, who had left her in the forest, where
Kaëva Muni found her. Kaëva Muni brought her to his äçrama, where he
raised and maintained her. When Çakuntalä accepted Mahäräja Duñmanta as
her husband, he married her according to the gändharva-vidhi. Çakuntalä later
became pregnant by her husband, who left her in the äçrama of Kaëva Muni
and returned to his kingdom.
In due course of time, Çakuntalä gave birth to a Vaiñëava son, but
Duñmanta, having returned to the capital, forgot what had taken place.
Therefore, when Çakuntalä approached him with her newly born child,
Mahäräja Duñmanta refused to accept them as his wife and son. Later,
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
750
however, after a mysterious omen, the King accepted them. After Mahäräja
Duñmanta's death, Bharata, the son of Çakuntalä, was enthroned. He
performed many great sacrifices, in which he gave great riches in charity to
the brähmaëas. This chapter ends by describing the birth of Bharadväja and
how Mahäräja Bharata accepted Bharadväja as his son.

which many saintly kings appeared, and from which many dynasties of
brähmaëas began.
PURPORT
There are many historical instances by which we can understand that from
kñatriyas many brähmaëas have been born and that from brähmaëas many
kñatriyas have been born. The Lord Himself says in Bhagavad-gétä (4.13),
cätur-varëyaà mayä såñöaà guëa-karma-vibhägaçaù: "According to the three
modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of
human society were created by Me." Therefore, regardless of the family in
which one takes birth, when one is qualified with the symptoms of a particular
section, he is to be described accordingly. Yal-lakñaëaà proktam. One's place
in the varëa divisions of society is determined according to one's symptoms or
qualities. This is maintained everywhere in the çästra. Birth is a secondary
consideration; the first consideration is one's qualities and activities.

had heard from him that she was the daughter of Viçvämitra and that her
mother was Menakä, who had left her in the forest.

King Duñmanta replied: O Çakuntalä, with beautiful eyebrows, you have

taken your birth in the family of the great saint Viçvämitra, and your reception
is quite worthy of your family. Aside from this, the daughters of a king
generally select their own husbands.
PURPORT
In her reception of Mahäräja Duñmanta, Çakuntalä clearly said, "Your
Majesty may stay here, and you may accept whatever reception I can offer."
Thus she indicated that she wanted Mahäräja Duñmanta as her husband. As
far as Mahäräja Duñmanta was concerned, he desired Çakuntalä as his wife
from the very beginning, as soon as he saw her, so the agreement to unite as
husband and wife was natural. To induce Çakuntalä to accept the marriage,
Mahäräja Duñmanta reminded her that as the daughter of a king she could
select her husband in an open assembly. In the history of Äryan civilization
there have been many instances in which famous princesses have selected
their husbands in open competitions. For example, it was in such a
competition that Sétädevé accepted Lord Rämacandra as her husband and that
Draupadé accepted Arjuna, and there are many other instances. So marriage
by agreement or by selecting one's own husband in an open competition is
allowed. There are eight kinds of marriage, of which marriage by agreement is
called gändharva marriage. Generally the parents select the husband or wife
for their daughter or son, but gändharva marriage takes place by personal
selection. Still, although marriage by personal selection or by agreement took
place in the past, we find no such thing as divorce by disagreement. Of course,
divorce by disagreement took place among low-class men, but marriage by
agreement was found even in the very highest classes, especially in the royal
kñatriya families. Mahäräja Duñmanta's acceptance of Çakuntalä as his wife was
sanctioned by Vedic culture. How the marriage took place is described in the
next verse.

om iti ukte—by reciting the Vedic praëava, invoking the Supreme Personality
of Godhead to witness the marriage; yathä-dharmam—exactly according to the
principles of religion (because Näräyaëa becomes the witness in an ordinary
religious marriage also); upayeme—he married; çakuntaläm—the girl
Çakuntalä; gändharva-vidhinä—by the regulative principle of the Gandharvas,
without deviation from religious principles; räjä—Mahäräja Duñmanta;
deça-käla-vidhäna-vit—completely aware of duties according to time, position
and objective.
TRANSLATION
When Çakuntalä responded to Mahäräja Duñmanta's proposal with silence,
the agreement was complete. Then the King, who knew the laws of marriage,
immediately married her by chanting the Vedic praëava [oàkära], in
accordance with the marriage ceremony as performed among the Gandharvas.
PURPORT
The oàkära, praëava, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead represented
by letters. Bhagavad-gétä says that the letters a-u-m, combined together as oà,
represent the Supreme Lord. Religious principles are meant to invoke the
blessings and mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, who says
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
764
in Bhagavad-gétä that He is personally present in sexual desires that are not
contrary to religious principles. The word vidhinä means, "according to
religious principles." The association of men and women according to religious
principles is allowed in the Vedic culture. In our Kåñëa consciousness
movement we allow marriage on the basis of religious principles, but the sexual
combination of men and women as friends is irreligious and is not allowed.

TRANSLATION
The voice said: O Mahäräja Duñmanta, a son actually belongs to his father,
whereas the mother is only a container, like the skin of a bellows. According to
Vedic injunctions, the father is born as the son. Therefore, maintain your own
son and do not insult Çakuntalä.
PURPORT
According to the Vedic injunction ätmä vai putra-nämäsi, the father
becomes the son. The mother is simply like a storekeeper, because the seed of
the child is placed in her womb, but it is the father who is responsible for
maintaining the son. In Bhagavad-gétä the Lord says that He is the seed-giving
father of all living entities (ahaà béja-pradaù pitä [Bg. 14.4]), and therefore He
is responsible for maintaining them. This is also confirmed in the Vedas. Eko
bahünäà yo vidadhäti kämän: although God is one, He maintains all living
entities with their necessities for life. The living entities in different forms are
sons of the Lord, and therefore the father, the Supreme Lord, supplies them
food according to their different bodies. The small ant is supplied a grain of
sugar, and the elephant is supplied tons of food, but everyone is able to eat.
Therefore there is no question of overpopulation. Because the father, Kåñëa, is
fully opulent, there is no scarcity of food, and because there is no scarcity, the
propaganda of overpopulation is only a myth. Actually one suffers for want of
food when material nature, under the order of the father, refuses to supply him
food. It is the living entity's position that determines whether food will be
supplied or not. When a diseased person is forbidden to eat, this does not mean
that there is a scarcity of food; rather, the diseased person requires the
treatment of not being supplied with food. In Bhagavad-gétä (7.10) the Lord
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
769
also says, béjaà mäà sama-bhütänäm: "I am the seed of all living entities." A
particular type of seed is sown within the earth, and then a particular type of
tree or plant comes out. The mother resembles the earth, and when a
particular type of seed is sown by the father, a particular type of body takes
birth.

Upon hearing the omen, Mahäräja Duñmanta accepted his wife and child.
According to Vedic småti:
pun-nämno narakäd yasmät
pitaraà träyate sutaù
tasmät putra iti proktaù
svayam eva svayambhuvä
Because a son delivers his father from punishment in the hell called put, the
son is called putra. According to this principle, when there is a disagreement
between the father and mother, it is the father, not the mother, who is
delivered by the son. But if the wife is faithful and firmly adherent to her
husband, when the father is delivered the mother is also delivered.
Consequently, there is no such thing as divorce in the Vedic literature. A wife
is always trained to be chaste and faithful to her husband, for this helps her
achieve deliverance from any abominable material condition. This verse
clearly says, putro nayati naradeva yama-kñayät: "The son saves his father from
the custody of Yamaräja." It never says, putro nayati mätaram: "The son saves
his mother." The seed-giving father is delivered, not the storekeeper mother.
Consequently, husband and wife should not separate under any condition, for
if they have a child whom they raise to be a Vaiñëava, he can save both the
father and mother from the custody of Yamaräja and punishment in hellish
life.

the son of Mahäräja Duñmanta, arranged for many ritualistic ceremonies all
over the world, especially all over India on the banks of the Ganges and
Yamunä, from the mouth to the source, and all such sacrifices were performed
in very distinguished places. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (3.9), yajïärthät
karmaëo 'nyatra loko 'yaà karma-bandhanaù: "Work done as a sacrifice for
Viñëu has to be performed, otherwise work binds one to this material world."
Everyone should engage in the performance of yajïa, and the sacrificial fire
should be ignited everywhere, the entire purpose being to make people happy,
prosperous and progressive in spiritual life. Of course, these things were
possible before the beginning of Kali-yuga because there were qualified
brähmaëas who could perform such yajïas. For the present, however, the
Brahma-vaivarta Puräëa enjoins:
açvamedhaà gavälambhaà
sannyäsaà pala-paitåkam
devareëa sutotpattià
kalau païca vivarjayet
[Cc. Ädi 17.164]
"In this age of Kali, five acts are forbidden: offering a horse in sacrifice,
offering a cow in sacrifice, accepting the order of sannyäsa, offering oblations
of flesh to the forefathers, and begetting children in the wife of one's brother."
In this age, such yajïas as the açvamedha-yajïa and gomedha-yajïa are
impossible to perform because there are neither sufficient riches nor qualified
brähmaëas. This verse says, mämateyaà purodhäya: Mahäräja Bharata engaged
the son of Mamatä, Bhågu Muni, to take charge of performing this yajïa. Now,
however, such brähmaëas are impossible to find. Therefore the çästras
recommend, yajïaiù saìkértana-präyair yajanti hi sumedhasaù: those who are
intelligent should perform the saìkértana-yajïa inaugurated by Lord Çré
Caitanya Mahäprabhu.

"In this age of Kali, people endowed with sufficient intelligence will worship
the Lord, who is accompanied by His associates, by performance of
saìkértana-yajïa." (SB 11.5.32) Yajïa must be performed, for otherwise people
will be entangled in sinful activities and will suffer immensely. Therefore the
Kåñëa consciousness movement has taken charge of introducing the chanting
of Hare Kåñëa all over the world. This Hare Kåñëa movement is also yajïa, but
without the difficulties involved in securing paraphernalia and qualified
brähmaëas. This congregational chanting can be performed anywhere and
everywhere. If people somehow or other assemble together and are induced to
chant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare
Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, all the purposes of yajïa will be fulfilled. The
first purpose is that there must be sufficient rain, for without rain there cannot
be any produce (annäd bhavanti bhütäni parjanyäd anna-sambhavaù [Bg. 3.14]).
All our necessities can be produced simply by rainfall (kämaà vavarña
parjanyaù [SB 1.10.4]), and the earth is the original source of all necessities
(sarva-käma-dughä mahé). In conclusion, therefore, in this age of Kali people
all over the world should refrain from the four principles of sinful life-illicit
sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling-and in a pure state of existence
should perform the simple yajïa of chanting the Hare Kåñëa mahä-mantra.
Then the earth will certainly produce all the necessities for life, and people
will be happy economically, politically, socially, religiously and culturally.
Everything will be in proper order.

Mamatä, who at that time was pregnant, he desired to have sexual relations

forcibly discharged semen into the womb of Mamatä.
PURPORT
The sex impulse is so strong in this material world that even Båhaspati, who
is supposed to be the priest of the demigods and a very learned scholar, wanted
to have a sexual relationship with his brother's pregnant wife. This can happen
even in the society of the higher demigods, so what to speak of human society?
The sex impulse is so strong that it can agitate even a learned personality like
Båhaspati.

TRANSLATION
Mamatä very much feared being forsaken by her husband for giving birth to
an illegitimate son, and therefore she considered giving up the child. But then
the demigods solved the problem by enunciating a name for the child.
PURPORT
According to Vedic scripture, whenever a child is born there are some
ceremonies known as jäta-karma and näma-karaëa, in which learned
brähmaëas, immediately after the birth of the child, make a horoscope
according to astrological calculations. But the child to which Mamatä gave
birth was begotten by Båhaspati irreligiously, for although Mamatä was the
wife of Utathya, Båhaspati made her pregnant by force. Therefore Båhaspati
became bhartä. According to Vedic culture, a wife is considered the property of
her husband, and a son born by illicit sex is called dväja. The common word
still current in Hindu society for such a son is doglä, which refers to a son not
begotten by the husband of his mother. In such a situation, it is difficult to give
the child a name according to proper regulative principles. Mamatä, therefore,
was perplexed, but the demigods gave the child the appropriate name
Bharadväja, which indicated that the child born illegitimately should be

maintained by both Mamatä and Båhaspati.

Båhaspati said to Mamatä, "You foolish woman, although this child was born
from the wife of one man through the semen discharged by another, you should
maintain him." Upon hearing this, Mamatä replied, "O Båhaspati, you maintain
him!" After speaking in this way, Båhaspati and Mamatä both left. Thus the
child was known as Bharadväja.

Although encouraged by the demigods to maintain the child, Mamatä
considered him useless because of his illicit birth, and therefore she left him.
Consequently, the demigods known as the Maruts maintained the child, and
when Mahäräja Bharata was disappointed for want of a child, this child was
given to him as his son.

on this planet earth.

the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Dynasty of Püru."
21. The Dynasty of Bharata
This Twenty-first Chapter describes the dynasty born from Mahäräja
Bharata, the son of Mahäräja Duñmanta, and it also describes the glories of
Rantideva, Ajaméòha and others.
The son of Bharadväja was Manyu, and Manyu's sons were Båhatkñatra,
Jaya, Mahävérya, Nara and Garga. Of these five, Nara had a son named
Saìkåti, who had two sons, named Guru and Rantideva. As an exalted
devotee, Rantideva saw every living entity in relationship with the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, and therefore he completely engaged his mind, his
words and his very self in the service of the Supreme Lord and His devotees.
Rantideva was so exalted that he would sometimes give away his own food in
charity, and he and his family would fast. Once, after Rantideva spent
forty-eight days fasting, not even drinking water, excellent food made with
ghee was brought to him, but when he was about to eat it a brähmaëa guest
appeared. Rantideva, therefore, did not eat the food, but instead immediately
offered a portion of it to the brähmaëa. When the brähmaëa left and
Rantideva was just about to eat the remnants of the food, a çüdra appeared.
Rantideva therefore divided the remnants between the çüdra and himself.
Again, when he was just about to eat the remnants of the food, another guest
appeared. Rantideva therefore gave the rest of the food to the new guest and
was about to content himself with drinking the water to quench his thirst, but
this also was precluded, for a thirsty guest came and Rantideva gave him the
water. This was all ordained by the Supreme Personality of Godhead just to
glorify His devotee and show how tolerant a devotee is in rendering service to
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
789
the Lord. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, being extremely pleased with
Rantideva, entrusted him with very confidential service. The special power to
render the most confidential service is entrusted by the Supreme Personality
of Godhead to a pure devotee, not to ordinary devotees.
Garga, the son of Bharadväja, had a son named Çini, and Çini's son was
Gärgya. Although Gärgya was a kñatriya by birth, his sons became brähmaëas.
The son of Mahävérya was Duritakñaya, whose sons were of a kñatriya king,
they also achieved the position of brähmaëas. The son of Båhatkñatra
constructed the city of Hastinäpura and was known as Hasté. His sons were
Ajaméòha, Dviméòha and Puruméòha.
From Ajaméòha came Priyamedha and other brähmaëas and also a son
named Båhadiñu. The sons, grandsons and further descendants of Båhadiñu
were Båhaddhanu, Båhatkäya, Jayadratha, Viçada and Syenajit. From Syenajit
came four sons-Ruciräçva, Dåòhahanu, Käçya and Vatsa. From Ruciräçva came
a son named Pära, whose sons were Påthusena and Népa, and from Népa came
one hundred sons. Another son of Népa was Brahmadatta. From Brahmadatta
came Viñvaksena; from Viñvaksena, Udaksena; and from Udaksena, Bhalläöa.
The son of Dviméòha was Yavénara, and from Yavénara came many sons
and grandsons, such as Kåtimän, Satyadhåti, Dåòhanemi, Supärçva, Sumati,
Sannatimän, Kåté, Népa, Udgräyudha, Kñemya, Suvéra, Ripuïjaya and
Bahuratha. Puruméòha had no sons, but Ajaméòha, in addition to his other
sons, had a son named Néla, whose son was Çänti. The descendants of Çänti
were Suçänti, Puruja, Arka and Bharmyäçva. Bharmyäçva had five sons, one of
whom, Mudgala, begot a dynasty of brähmaëas. Mudgala had twins-a son,
Divodäsa, and a daughter, Ahalyä. From Ahalyä, by her husband, Gautama,
Çatänanda was born. The son of Çatänanda was Satyadhåti, and his son was
Çaradvän. Çaradvän's son was known as Kåpa, and Çaradvän's daughter, known
as Kåpé, became the wife of Droëäcärya.

TRANSLATION
Because Rantideva perceived the presence of the Supreme Godhead
everywhere, and in every living entity, he received the guest with faith and

respect and gave him a share of the food. The brähmaëa guest ate his share and
then went away.
PURPORT
Rantideva perceived the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead
in every living being, but he never thought that because the Supreme Lord is
present in every living being, every living being must be God. Nor did he
distinguish between one living being and another. He perceived the presence
of the Lord both in the brähmaëa and in the caëòäla. This is the true vision of
equality, as confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gétä (5.18):
vidyä-vinaya-sampanne
brähmaëe gavi hastini
çuni caiva çva-päke ca
paëòitäù sama-darçinaù
"The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned
and gentle brähmaëa, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater [outcaste]." A
paëòita, or learned person, perceives the presence of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead in every living being. Therefore, although it has now become
fashionable to give preference to the so-called daridra-näräyaëa, or "poor
Näräyaëa," Rantideva had no reason to give preference to any one person. The
idea that because Näräyaëa is present in the heart of one who is daridra, or
poor, the poor man should be called daridra-näräyaëa is a wrong conception.
By such logic, because the Lord is present within the hearts of the dogs and
hogs, the dogs and hogs would also be Näräyaëa. One should not mistakenly
think that Rantideva subscribed to this view. Rather, he saw everyone as part
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (hari-sambandhi-vastunaù). It is not
that everyone is the Supreme Godhead. Such a theory, which is propounded by
the Mäyäväda philosophy, is always misleading, and Rantideva would never
have accepted it.

TRANSLATION
Thereafter, having divided the remaining food with his relatives, Rantideva
was just about to eat his own share when a çüdra guest arrived. Seeing the çüdra
in relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, King Rantideva gave
him also a share of the food.
PURPORT
Because King Rantideva saw everyone as part of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, he never distinguished between the brähmaëa and the çüdra, the
poor and the rich. Such equal vision is called sama-darçinaù (paëòitäù
sama-darçinaù [Bg. 5.18]). One who has actually realized that the Supreme

Personality of Godhead is situated in everyone's heart and that every living
being is part of the Lord does not make any distinction between the brähmaëa
and the çüdra, the poor (daridra) and the rich (dhané). Such a person sees all
living beings equally and treats them equally, without discrimination.

Väsudeva Datta made a similar statement to Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu,
requesting the Lord to liberate all living entities in His presence. Väsudeva
Datta submitted that if they were unfit to be liberated, he himself would take
all their sinful reactions and suffer personally so that the Lord might deliver
them. A Vaiñëava is therefore described as being para-duùkha-duùkhé, very
much aggrieved by the sufferings of others. As such, a Vaiñëava engages in
activities for the real welfare of human society.

(7.20), kämais tais tair håta jïänäù prapadyante 'nya-devatäù: those befooled by
the illusion of the material energy worship gods other than the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Therefore, although Rantideva was personally able to
see Lord Brahmä and Lord Çiva, he did not hanker to take material benefits
from them. Rather, he fixed his mind upon Lord Väsudeva and rendered
devotional service unto Him. This is the sign of a pure devotee, whose heart is

O Mahäräja Parékñit, because King Rantideva was a pure devotee, always
Kåñëa conscious and free from all material desires, the Lord's illusory energy,
mäyä, could not exhibit herself before him. On the contrary, for him mäyä
entirely vanished, exactly like a dream.
PURPORT
As it is said:
kåñëa—sürya-sama; mäyä haya andhakära
yähäì kåñëa, tähäì nähi mäyära adhikära
Just as there is no chance that darkness can exist in the sunshine, in a pure
Kåñëa conscious person there can be no existence of mäyä. The Lord Himself
says in Bhagavad-gétä (7.14):
daivé hy eñä guëa-mayé
mama mäyä duratyayä
mäm eva ye prapadyante
mäyäm etäà taranti te
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
806
"This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature,
is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily
cross beyond it." If one wants to be free from the influence of mäyä, the
illusory energy, one must become Kåñëa conscious and always keep Kåñëa
prominent within the core of his heart. In Bhagavad-gétä (9.34) the Lord
advises that one always think of Him (man-manä bhava mad-bhakto mad-yäjé
mäà namaskuru [Bg. 18.65]). In this way, by always being Kåñëa-minded or
Kåñëa conscious, one can surpass the influence of mäyä (mäyäm etäà taranti te
[Bg. 7.14]). Because Rantideva was Kåñëa conscious, he was not under the
influence of the illusory energy. The word svapnavat is significant in this
connection. Because in the material world the mind is absorbed in
materialistic activities, when one is asleep many contradictory activities
appear in one's dreams. When one awakens, however, these activities
automatically merge into the mind. Similarly, as long as one is under the
influence of the material energy he makes many plans and schemes, but when
one is Kåñëa conscious such dreamlike plans automatically disappear.

All those who followed the principles of King Rantideva were totally favored

"Of all yogés, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in
transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is
the highest of all." The best yogé is he who constantly thinks of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead within the core of the heart. Because Rantideva was
the king, the chief executive in the state, all the residents of the state became
devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Näräyaëa, by the king's
transcendental association. This is the influence of a pure devotee. If there is
one pure devotee, his association can create hundreds and thousands of pure
devotees. Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura has said that a Vaiñëava is meritorious
in proportion to the number of devotees he has created. A Vaiñëava becomes
superior not simply by jugglery of words but by the number of devotees he has

created for the Lord. Here the word rantidevänuvartinaù indicates that
Rantideva's officers, friends, relatives and subjects all became first-class
Vaiñëavas by his association. In other words, Rantideva is confirmed herein to
be a first-class devotee, or mahä-bhägavata. Mahat-seväà dväram ähur

PURPORT
This verse gives evidence confirming the statement of Bhagavad-gétä that
the orders of society—brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra—are calculated in
terms of qualities and activities (guëa-karma-vibhägaçaù [Bg. 4.13]). All the
descendants of Ajaméòha, who was a kñatriya, became brähmaëas. This was
certainly because of their qualities and activities. Similarly, sometimes the sons
of brähmaëas or kñatriyas become vaiçyas (brähmaëa-vaiçyatäà gatäù). When a
kñatriya or brähmaëa adopts the occupation or duty of a vaiçya
(kåñi-go-rakñya-väëijyam [Bg. 18.44]), he is certainly counted as a vaiçya. On the
other hand, if one is born a vaiçya, by his activities he can become a brähmaëa.
This is confirmed by Närada Muni. Yasya yal-lakñaëaà proktam. The members
of the varëas, or social orders-brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra-must be
ascertained by their symptoms, not by birth. Birth is immaterial; quality is
essential.

PURPORT
The Çuka mentioned here is different from the Çukadeva Gosvämé who
spoke Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Çukadeva Gosvämé, the son of Vyäsadeva, is
described in great detail in the Brahma-vaivarta Puräëa. There it is said that
Vyäsadeva maintained the daughter of Jäbäli as his wife and that after they
performed penances together for many years, he placed his seed in her womb.
The child remained in the womb of his mother for twelve years, and when the
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
814
father asked the son to come out, the son replied that he would not come out
unless he were completely liberated from the influence of mäyä. Vyäsadeva
then assured the child that he would not be influenced by mäyä, but the child
did not believe his father, for the father was still attached to his wife and
children. Vyäsadeva then went to Dvärakä and informed the Personality of
Godhead about his problem, and the Personality of Godhead, at Vyäsadeva's
request, went to Vyäsadeva's cottage, where He assured the child in the womb
that he would not be influenced by mäyä. Thus assured, the child came out,
but he immediately went away as a parivräjakäcärya. When the father, very
much aggrieved, began to follow his saintly boy, Çukadeva Gosvämé, the boy
created a duplicate Çukadeva, who later entered family life. Therefore, the
çuka-kanyä, or daughter of Çukadeva, mentioned in this verse is the daughter
of the duplicate or imitation Çukadeva. The original Çukadeva was a lifelong
brahmacäré.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Twenty-first Chapter,
of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Dynasty of Bharata."
22. The Descendants of Ajaméòha
This chapter describes the descendants of Divodäsa. It also describes
Jaräsandha, who belonged to the Åkña dynasty, as well as Duryodhana, Arjuna
and others.
The son of Divodäsa was Miträyu, who had four sons, one after
another-Cyavana, Sudäsa, Sahadeva and Somaka. Somaka had one hundred
sons, of whom the youngest was Påñata, from whom Drupada was born.
Drupada's daughter was Draupadé, and his sons were headed by Dhåñöadyumna.
Dhåñöadyumna's son was Dhåñöaketu.
Another son of Ajaméòha was named Åkña. From Åkña came a son named
Saàvaraëa, and from Saàvaraëa came Kuru, the king of Kurukñetra. Kuru
had four sons-Parékñi, Sudhanu, Jahnu and Niñadha. Among the descendants
in the dynasty from Sudhanu were Suhotra, Cyavana, Kåté and Uparicara
Vasu. The sons of Uparicara Vasu, including Båhadratha, Kuçämba, Matsya,
Pratyagra and Cedipa, became kings of the Cedi state. In the dynasty from
Båhadratha came Kuçägra, Åñabha, Satyahita, Puñpavän and Jahu, and from
Båhadratha through the womb of another wife came Jaräsandha, who was
followed by Sahadeva, Somäpi and Çrutaçravä. Parékñi, the son of Kuru, had no
sons. Among the descendants of Jahnu were Suratha, Vidüratha,
Särvabhauma, Jayasena, Rädhika, Ayutäyu, Akrodhana, Devätithi, Åkña,
Dilépa and Pratépa.
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
823
The sons of Pratépa were Deväpi, Çäntanu and Bähléka. When Deväpi
retired to the forest, his younger brother Çäntanu became the king. Although
Çäntanu, being younger, was not eligible to occupy the throne, he disregarded
his elder brother. Consequently, there was no rainfall for twelve years.
Following the advice of the brähmaëas, Çäntanu was ready to return the
kingdom to Deväpi, but by the intrigue of Çäntanu's minister, Deväpi became
unfit to be king. Therefore Çäntanu resumed charge of the kingdom, and rain
fell properly during his regime. By mystic power, Deväpi still lives in the
village known as Kaläpa-gräma. In this Kali-yuga, when the descendants of
Soma known as the candra-vaàça (the lunar dynasty) die out, Deväpi, at the
beginning of Satya-yuga, will reestablish the dynasty of the moon. The wife of
Çäntanu named Gaìgä gave birth to Bhéñma, one of the twelve authorities.
Two sons named Citräìgada and Vicitravérya were also born from the womb of
Satyavaté by the semen of Çäntanu, and Vyäsadeva was born from Satyavaté by
the semen of Paräçara, Vyäsadeva instructed the history of the Bhägavatam to
his son Çukadeva. Through the womb of the two wives and the maidservant of
Vicitravérya, Vyäsadeva begot Dhåtaräñöra, Päëòu and Vidura.
Dhåtaräñöra had one hundred sons, headed by Duryodhana, and one
daughter named Duùçalä. Päëòu had five sons, headed by Yudhiñöhira, and
each of these five sons had one son from Draupadé. The names of these sons of
Draupadé were Prativindhya, Çrutasena, Çrutakérti, Çatänéka and Çrutakarmä.
Besides these five sons, by other wives the Päëòavas had many other sons, such
as Devaka, Ghaöotkaca, Sarvagata, Suhotra, Naramitra, Irävän, Babhruvähana
and Abhimanyu. From Abhimanyu, Mahäräja Parékñit was born, and Mahäräja
Parékñit had four sons-Janamejaya, Çrutasena, Bhémasena and Ugrasena.
Next Çukadeva Gosvämé described the future sons of the Päëòu family.
From Janamejaya, he said, would come a son named Çatänéka, and following in
the dynasty would be Sahasränéka, Açvamedhaja, Asémakåñëa, Nemicakra,
Citraratha, Çuciratha, Våñöimän, Suñeëa, Sunétha, Nåcakñu, Sukhénala,
Pariplava, Sunaya, Medhävé, Nåpaïjaya, Dürva, Timi, Båhadratha, Sudäsa,
Çatänéka, Durdamana, Mahénara, Daëòapäëi, Nimi and Kñemaka.
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
824
Çukadeva Gosvämé then predicted the kings of the mägadha-vaàça, or
Mägadha dynasty. Sahadeva, the son of Jaräsandha, would beget Märjäri, and
from him would come Çrutaçravä. Subsequently taking birth in the dynasty
will be Yutäyu, Niramitra, Sunakñatra, Båhatsena, Karmajit, Sutaïjaya, Vipra,
Çuci, Kñema, Suvrata, Dharmasütra, Sama, Dyumatsena, Sumati, Subala,
Sunétha, Satyajit, Viçvajit and Ripuïjaya.

you should return the kingdom to him."

TRANSLATION
When the brähmaëas said this, Mahäräja Çäntanu went to the forest and
requested his elder brother Deväpi to take charge of the kingdom, for it is the
duty of a king to maintain his subjects. Previously, however, Çäntanu's minister
Açvavära had instigated some brähmaëas to induce Deväpi to transgress the
injunctions of the Vedas and thus make himself unfit for the post of ruler. The
brähmaëas deviated Deväpi from the path of the Vedic principles, and therefore
when asked by Çäntanu he did not agree to accept the post of ruler. On the
contrary, he blasphemed the Vedic principles and therefore became fallen.
Under the circumstances, Çäntanu again became the king, and Indra, being
pleased, showered rains. Deväpi later took to the path of mystic yoga to control
his mind and senses and went to the village named Kaläpagräma, where he is
still living.

Satyavaté was actually the daughter of Uparicara Vasu by the womb of a

Bhéñmadeva, acting on behalf of his brother Vicitravérya. Ambä thought that
Bhéñmadeva would marry her and became attached to him, but Bhéñmadeva
refused to marry her, for he had taken the vow of brahmacarya. Ambä
therefore approached Bhéñmadeva's military spiritual master, Paraçuräma, who
instructed Bhéñma to marry her. Bhéñmadeva refused, and therefore

sons were Dhåtaräñöra, Päëòu and Vidura.
PURPORT
Vicitravérya died of tuberculosis, and his wives, Ambikä and Ambälikä, had
no issue. Therefore, after Vicitravérya's death, his mother, Satyavaté, who was
also the mother of Vyäsadeva, asked Vyäsadeva to beget children through the
wives of Vicitravérya. In those days, the brother of the husband could beget
children through the womb of his sister-in-law. This was known as devareëa
sutotpatti. If the husband was somehow unable to beget children, his brother
could do so through the womb of his sister-in-law. This devareëa sutotpatti and
the sacrifices of açvamedha and gomedha are forbidden in the age of Kali.

[Cc. Ädi 17.164]
"In this age of Kali, five acts are forbidden: the offering of a horse in sacrifice,
the offering of a cow in sacrifice, the acceptance of the order of sannyäsa, the
offering of oblations of flesh to the forefathers, and a man's begetting children
in his brother's wife." (Brahma-vaivarta Puräëa).

PURPORT
It is to be understood that Pärvaté is the daughter of the king of the very,
very old mountainous country known as the Maëipura state. Five thousand
years ago, therefore, when the Päëòavas ruled, Maëipura existed, as did its
king. Therefore this kingdom is a very old, aristocratic Vaiñëava kingdom. If
this kingdom is organized as a Vaiñëava state, this revitalization will be a great
success because for five thousand years this state has maintained its identity. If
the Vaiñëava spirit is revived there, it will be a wonderful place, renowned

throughout the entire world. Maëipuri Vaiñëavas are very famous in Vaiñëava
society. In Våndävana and Navadvépa there are many temples constructed by
the king of Maëipura. Some of our devotees belong to the Maëipura state. The
Kåñëa consciousness movement, therefore, can be well spread in the state of
Maëipura by the cooperative efforts of the Kåñëa conscious devotees.

PURPORT
This is the history of a monarchy that began with Jaräsandha and continues
for one thousand years as the above-mentioned kings appear on the surface of
the globe.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Twenty-second
Chapter, of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Descendants of Ajaméòha."
23. The Dynasties of the Sons of Yayäti
In this Twenty-third Chapter the dynasties of Anu, Druhyu, Turvasu and
Yadu, as well as the story of Jyämagha, are described.
The sons of Yayäti's fourth son, Anu, were Sabhänara, Cakñu and Pareñëu.
Of these three, the sons and grandsons of Sabhänara were, in succession,
Kälanara, Såïjaya, Janamejaya, Mahäçäla and Mahämanä. The sons of
Mahämanä were Uçénara and Titikñu. Uçénara had four sons, namely Çibi,
Vara, Kåmi and Dakña. Çibi also had four sons-Våñädarbha, Sudhéra, Madra
and Kekaya. The son of Titikñu was Ruñadratha, who begot a son named
Homa. From Homa came Sutapä and from Sutapä, Bali. In this way the dynasty
continued. Begotten by Dérghatamä in the womb of the wife of Bali were
Aìga, Vaìga, Kaliìga, Suhma, Puëòra and Oòra, all of whom became kings.
From Aìga came Khalapäna, whose dynasty included Diviratha,
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
861
Dharmaratha and Citraratha, also called Romapäda, one after another.
Mahäräja Daçaratha gave in charity one of his daughters, by the name Çäntä,
to his friend Romapäda because Romapäda had no sons. Romapäda accepted
Çäntä as his daughter, and the great sage Åñyaçåìga married her. By the mercy
of Åñyaçåìga, Romapäda had a son named Caturaìga. The son of Caturaìga
was Påthuläkña, who had three sons-Båhadratha, Båhatkarmä and Båhadbhänu.
From Båhadratha came a son named Båhadmanä, whose sons and grandsons in
succession were Jayadratha, Vijaya, Dhåti, Dhåtavrata, Satkarmä and
Adhiratha. Adhiratha accepted the son rejected by Kunté, namely Karëa, and
Karëa's son was Våñasena.
The son of Yayäti's third son, Druhyu, was Babhru, whose son and
grandsons were Setu, Ärabdha, Gändhära, Dharma, Dhåta, Durmada and
Pracetä.
The son of Yayäti's second son, Turvasu, was Vahni, whose seminal dynasty
included Bharga, Bhänumän, Tribhänu, Karandhama and Maruta. The
childless Maruta accepted Duñmanta, who belonged to the Püru dynasty, as his
adopted son. Mahäräja Duñmanta was anxious to have his kingdom returned,
and so he went back to the Püru-vaàça.
Of the four sons of Yadu, Sahasrajit was the eldest. The son of Sahasrajit
was named Çatajit. He had three sons, of whom one was Haihaya. The sons and
grandsons in the dynasty of Haihaya were Dharma, Netra, Kunti, Sohaïji,
Mahiñmän, Bhadrasenaka, Dhanaka, Kåtavérya, Arjuna, Jayadhvaja,
Tälajaìgha and Vétihotra.
The son of Vétihotra was Madhu, whose eldest son was Våñëi. Because of
Yadu, Madhu and Våñëi, their dynasties are known as Yädava, Mädhava and
Våñëi. Another son of Yadu was Kroñöä, and from him came Våjinavän,
Svähita, Viñadgu, Citraratha, Çaçabindu, Påthuçravä, Dharma, Uçanä and
Rucaka. Rucaka had five sons, one of whom was known as Jyämagha. Jyämagha
was sonless, but by the mercy of the demigods his childless wife gave birth to a
son named Vidarbha.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, the Supersoul in the hearts of

and Ripu. Of these four, the eldest, Sahasrajit, had a son named Çatajit, who
had three sons, named Mahähaya, Reëuhaya and Haihaya.

As confirmed in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.2.11):
vadanti tat tattva-vidas
tattvaà yaj jïänam advayam
brahmeti paramätmeti
bhagavän iti çabdyate
"Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this nondual
substance Brahman, Paramätmä or Bhagavän." The majority of
transcendentalists understand only the impersonal Brahman or localized
Paramätmä, for the Personality of Godhead is very difficult to understand. As
the Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä (7.3):
manuñyäëäà sahasreñu
kaçcid yatati siddhaye
yatatäm api siddhänäà
kaçcin mäà vetti tattvataù
"Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of
those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth." The yogés
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
877
and jïänés—that is, the mystic yogés and the impersonalists—can understand
the Absolute Truth as impersonal or localized, but although such realized souls
are above ordinary human beings, they cannot understand how the Supreme
Absolute Truth can be a person. Therefore it is said that out of many siddhas,
the souls who have already realized the Absolute Truth, one may understand
Kåñëa, who exactly resembles a human being (naräkåti). This human form was
explained by Kåñëa Himself after He manifested the viräö-rüpa. The viräö-rüpa
is not the original form of the Lord; the Lord's original form is
Dvibhuja-çyämasundara, Muralédhara, the Lord with two hands, playing a flute
(yaà çyämasundaram acintya-guëa-svarüpam). The Lord's forms are proof of
His inconceivable qualities. Although the Lord maintains innumerable
universes within the period of His breath, He is dressed with a form exactly
like that of a human being. That does not mean, however, that He is a human
being. This is His original form, but because He looks like a human being,
those with a poor fund of knowledge consider Him an ordinary man. The Lord
says:
avajänanti mäà müòhä
mänuñéà tanum äçritam
paraà bhävam ajänanto
mama bhüta-maheçvaram
"Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My
transcendental nature and My supreme dominion over all that be." (Bg. 9.11)
By the Lord's paraà bhävam, or transcendental nature, He is the all-pervading
Paramätmä living in the core of the hearts of all living entities, yet He looks
like a human being. Mäyäväda philosophy says that the Lord is originally
impersonal but assumes a human form and many other forms when He
descends. Actually, however, He is originally like a human being, and the
impersonal Brahman consists of the rays of His body (yasya prabhä prabhavato
jagad-aëòa-koöi [Bs. 5.40]).

Long, long ago, Jyämagha had satisfied the demigods and Pitäs by worshiping

them. Now, by their mercy, Jyämagha's words came true. Although Çaibyä was
barren, by the grace of the demigods she became pregnant and in due course of
time gave birth to a child named Vidarbha. Before the child's birth, the girl had
been accepted as a daughter-in-law, and therefore Vidarbha actually married
her when he grew up.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Twenty-third Chapter,
of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, entitled "The Dynasties of the Sons of Yayäti."
24. Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead
Vidarbha had three sons, named Kuça, Kratha and Romapäda. Of these
three, Romapäda expanded his dynasty by the sons and grandsons named
Babhru, Kåti, Uçika, Cedi and Caidya, all of whom later became kings. From
the son of Vidarbha named Kratha came a son named Kunti, from whose
dynasty came the descendants named Våñëi, Nirvåti, Daçärha, Vyoma, Jémüta,
Vikåti, Bhémaratha, Navaratha, Daçaratha, Çakuni, Karambhi, Devaräta,
Devakñatra, Madhu, Kuruvaça, Anu, Puruhotra, Ayu and Sätvata. Sätvata had
seven sons. One of them was Devävådha, whose son was Babhru. Another son
of Sätvata was Mahäbhoja, by whom the Bhoja dynasty was inaugurated.
Another was Våñëi, who had a son named Yudhäjit. From Yudhäjit came
Anamitra and Çini, and from Anamitra came Nighna and another Çini. The
descendants in succession from Çini were Satyaka, Yuyudhäna, Jaya, Kuëi and
Yugandhara. Another son of Anamitra was Våñëi. From Våñëi came
Çvaphalka, by whom Akrüra and twelve other sons were generated. From
Akrüra came two sons, named Devavän and Upadeva. The son of Andhaka
named Kukura was the origin of the descendants known as Vahni, Vilomä,

892
Kapotaromä, Anu, Andhaka, Dundubhi, Avidyota, Punarvasu and Ähuka.
Ähuka had two sons, named Devaka and Ugrasena. The four sons of Devaka
were known as Devavän, Upadeva, Sudeva and Devavardhana, and his seven
daughters were Dhåtadevä, Çäntidevä, Upadevä, Çrédevä, Devarakñitä,
Sahadevä and Devaké. Vasudeva married all seven daughters of Devaka.
Ugrasena had nine sons named Kaàsa, Sunämä, Nyagrodha, Kaìka, Çaìku,
Suhü, Räñörapäla, Dhåñöi and Tuñöimän, and he had five daughters named
Kaàsä, Kaàsavaté, Kaìkä, Çürabhü and Räñörapälikä. The younger brothers of
Vasudeva married all the daughters of Ugrasena.
Vidüratha, the son of Citraratha, had a son named Çüra, who had ten other
sons, of whom Vasudeva was the chief. Çüra gave one of his five daughters,
Påthä, to his friend Kunti, and therefore she was also named Kunté. In her
maiden state she gave birth to a child named Karëa, and later she married
Mahäräja Päëòu.
Våddhaçarmä married the daughter of Çüra named Çrutadevä, from whose
womb Dantavakra was born. Dhåñöaketu married Çüra's daughter named
Çrutakérti, who had five sons. Jayasena married Çüra's daughter named
Räjädhidevé. The king of Cedi-deça, Damaghoña, married the daughter of Çüra
named Çrutaçravä, from whom Çiçupäla was born.
Devabhäga, through the womb of Kaàsä, begot Citraketu and Båhadbala;
and Devaçravä, through the womb of Kaàsavaté, begot Suvéra and Iñumän.
From Kaìka, through the womb of Kaìkä, came Baka, Satyajit and Purujit,
and from Såïjaya, through the womb of Räñörapälikä, came Våña and
Durmarñaëa. Çyämaka, through the womb of Çürabhümi, begot Harikeça and
Hiraëyäkña. Vatsaka, through the womb of Miçrakeçé, begot Våka, who begot
the sons named Takña, Puñkara and Çäla. From Saméka came Sumitra and
Arjunapäla, and from Änaka came Åtadhämä and Jaya.
Vasudeva had many wives, of whom Devaké and Rohiëé were the most
important. From the womb of Rohiëé, Baladeva was born, along with Gada,
Säraëa, Durmada, Vipula, Dhruva, Kåta and others. Vasudeva had many other
sons by his other wives, and the eighth son to appear from the womb of Devaké

was the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who delivered the entire world from
the burden of demons. This chapter ends by glorifying the Supreme
Personality of Godhead Väsudeva.

spotlessly pious personalities. When Vasudeva was born, the demigods from the

proper place for the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa,

was also known as Änakadundubhi. The five daughters of King Çüra, named
Påthä, Çrutadevä, Çrutakérti, Çrutaçravä and Räjädhidevé, were Vasudeva's
sisters. Çüra gave Påthä to his friend Kunti, who had no issue, and therefore
another name of Påthä was Kunté.

TRANSLATION
The sun-god said: O beautiful Påthä, your meeting with the demigods cannot
be fruitless. Therefore, let me place my seed in your womb so that you may bear
a son. I shall arrange to keep your virginity intact, since you are still an
unmarried girl.
PURPORT
According to Vedic civilization, if a girl gives birth to a child before she is
married, no one will marry her. Therefore although the sun-god, after
appearing before Påthä, wanted to give her a child, Påthä hesitated because she
was still unmarried. To keep her virginity undisturbed, the sun-god arranged to
give her a child that came from her ear, and therefore the child was known as
Karëa. The custom is that a girl should be married akñata-yoni, that is, with
her virginity undisturbed. A girl should never bear a child before her marriage.

The eight sons born of Sahadevä such as Pravara and Çruta, were exact

eight highly qualified sons through the womb of Devaké. These included
Kértimän, Suñeëa, Bhadrasena, Åju, Sammardana, Bhadra and Saìkarñaëa, the
controller and serpent incarnation. The eighth son was the Supreme Personality
of Godhead Himself—Kåñëa. The highly fortunate Subhadrä, the one daughter,
was your grandmother.

The fifty-fifth verse says, svayam eva hariù kila, indicating that Kåñëa, the
eighth son of Devaké, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Kåñëa is not an
incarnation. Although there is no difference between the Supreme Personality
of Godhead Hari and His incarnation, Kåñëa is the original Supreme Person,
the complete Godhead. Incarnations exhibit only a certain percentage of the
potencies of Godhead; the complete Godhead is Kåñëa Himself, who appeared
as the eighth son of Devaké.

"Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant
of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion—at that time I descend
Myself."
In the present age, the Supreme Personality of Godhead has appeared as Çré
Caitanya Mahäprabhu to inaugurate the Hare Kåñëa movement. At the
present time, in Kali-yuga, people are extremely sinful and bad (manda). They
have no idea of spiritual life and are misusing the benefits of the human form
to live like cats and dogs. Under these circumstances Çré Caitanya
Mahäprabhu has inaugurated the Hare Kåñëa movement, which is not
different from Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one associates
with this movement, he directly associates with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. People should take advantage of the chanting of the Hare Kåñëa
mantra and thus gain relief from all the problems created in this age of Kali.

O King, Mahäräja Parékñit, but for the Lord's personal desire, there is no
cause for His appearance, disappearance or activities. As the Supersoul, He
knows everything. Consequently there is no cause that affects Him, not even
the results of fruitive activities.
PURPORT
This verse points out the difference between the Supreme Personality of
Godhead and an ordinary living being. An ordinary living being receives a
particular type of body according to his past activities (karmaëä daiva-netreëa
jantur dehopapattaye [SB 3.31.1]). A living being is never independent and can
never appear independently. Rather, one is forced to accept a body imposed
upon him by mäyä according to his past karma. As explained in Bhagavad-gétä
(18.61), yanträrüòhäni mäyayä. The body is a kind of machine created and
offered to the living entity by the material energy under the direction of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the living entity must accept a
particular type of body awarded to him by mäyä, the material energy,
according to his karma. One cannot independently say, "Give me a body like
this" or "Give me a body like that." One must accept whatever body is offered
by the material energy. This is the position of the ordinary living being.
When Kåñëa descends, however, He does so out of His merciful compassion
for the fallen souls. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä (4.8):
pariträëäya sädhünäà
vinäçäya ca duñkåtäm
dharma-saàsthäpanärthäya
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
933
sambhavämi yuge yuge
"To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish
the principles of religion, I advent Myself millennium after millennium." The
Supreme Lord is not forced to appear. Indeed, no one can subject Him to force,
for He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Everyone is under His control,
and He is not under the control of anyone else. Foolish people who because of
a poor fund of knowledge think that one can equal Kåñëa or become Kåñëa are
condemned in every way. No one can equal or surpass Kåñëa, who is therefore
described as asamaurdhva. According to the Viçva-koça dictionary, the word
mäyä is used in the sense of "false pride" and also in the sense of "compassion."
For an ordinary living being, the body in which he appears is his punishment.
As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä (7.14), daivé hy eñä guëa-mayé mama mäyä
duratyayä: "This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of
material nature, is difficult to overcome." But when Kåñëa comes the word
mäyä refers to His compassion or mercy upon the devotees and fallen souls. By
His potency, the Lord can deliver everyone, whether sinful or pious.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead acts through His material energy in
the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this cosmic manifestation just to
deliver the living entity by His compassion and stop the living entity's birth,
death and duration of materialistic life. Thus He enables the living being to
return home, back to Godhead.
PURPORT
Materialistic men sometimes ask why God has created the material world
for the suffering of the living entities. The material creation is certainly meant
for the suffering of the conditioned souls, who are part of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, as confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gétä
(15.7):
mamaiväàço jéva-loke
jéva-bhütaù sanätanaù
manaù ñañöhänéndriyäëi
prakåti-sthäni karñati
"The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts.
Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses,
which include the mind." All the living entities are part and parcel of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead and are as good as the Lord qualitatively, but
quantitatively there is a great difference between them, for the Lord is
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
935
unlimited whereas the living entities are limited. Thus the Lord possesses
unlimited potency for pleasure, and the living entities have a limited pleasure
potency. Änandamayo 'bhyäsät (Vedänta-sütra 1.1.12). Both the Lord and the
living entity, being qualitatively spirit soul, have the tendency for peaceful
enjoyment, but when the part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead
unfortunately wants to enjoy independently, without Kåñëa, he is put into the
material world, where he begins his life as Brahmä and is gradually degraded to
the status of an ant or a worm in stool. This is called manaù ñañöhänéndriyäëi
prakåti-sthäni karñati. There is a great struggle for existence because the living
entity conditioned by material nature is under nature's full control (prakåteù
kriyamäëäni guëaiù karmäëi sarvaçaù [Bg. 3.27]). Because of his limited
knowledge, however, the living entity thinks he is enjoying in this material
world. Manaù ñañöhänéndriyäëi prakåti-sthäni karñati. He is actually under the
full control of material nature, but still he thinks himself independent
(ahaìkära-vimüòhätmä kartäham iti manyate). Even when he is elevated by
speculative knowledge and tries to merge into the existence of Brahman, the
same disease continues.
Äruhya kåcchreëa paraà padaà tataù patanty adhaù (SB 10.2.32). Even
having attained that paraà padam, having merged into the impersonal
Brahman, he falls again to the material world.
In this way, the conditioned soul undergoes a great struggle for existence in
this material world, and therefore the Lord, out of compassion for him, appears
in this world and instructs him. Thus the Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä (4.7):
yadä yadä hi dharmasya
glänir bhavati bhärata
abhyutthänam adharmasya
tadätmänaà såjämy aham
"Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant
of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion—at that time I descend
Myself." The real dharma is to surrender unto Kåñëa, but the rebellious living
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
936
entity, instead of surrendering to Kåñëa, engages in adharma, in a struggle for
existence to become like Kåñëa. Therefore out of compassion Kåñëa creates
this material world to give the living entity a chance to understand his real
position. Bhagavad-gétä and similar Vedic literatures are presented so that the
living being may understand his relationship with Kåñëa. Vedaiç ca sarvair
aham eva vedyaù (Bg. 15.15). All these Vedic literatures are meant to enable the
human being to understand what he is, what his actual position is, and what
his relationship is with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called
brahma-jijïäsä. Every conditioned soul is struggling, but human life provides
the best chance for him to understand his position. Therefore this verse says,
anugrahas tan-nivåtteù, indicating that the false life of repeated birth and
death must be stopped and the conditioned soul should be educated. This is the
purpose of the creation.
The creation does not arise whimsically, as atheistic men think.
asatyam apratiñöhaà te
jagad ähur anéçvaram
aparaspara-sambhütaà
kim anyat käma-haitukam
"They say that this world is unreal, that there is no foundation and that there
is no God in control. It is produced of sex desire and has no cause other than
lust." (Bg. 16.8) Atheistic rascals think that there is no God and that the
creation has taken place by chance, just as a man and woman meet by chance
and the woman becomes pregnant and gives birth to a child. Actually,
however, this is not the fact. The fact is that there is a purpose for this
creation: to give the conditioned soul a chance to return to his original
consciousness, Kåñëa consciousness, and then return home, back to Godhead,
and be completely happy in the spiritual world. In the material world the
conditioned soul is given a chance to satisfy his senses, but at the same time he
is informed by Vedic knowledge that this material world is not his actual place
for happiness. Janma-måtyu-jarä-vyädhi-duùkha-doñänudarçanam (Bg. 13.9).

One must stop the repetition of birth and death. Every human being,
therefore, should take advantage of this creation by understanding Kåñëa and
his relationship with Kåñëa and in this way return home, back to Godhead.

Although the demons who take possession of the government are dressed

Consequently, by the arrangement of God, such demons, who possess great
military strength, fight with one another, and thus the great burden of demons

on the surface of the earth is reduced. The demons increase their military
power by the will of the Supreme, so that their numbers will be diminished and
the devotees will have a chance to advance in Kåñëa consciousness.
PURPORT
As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (4.8), pariträëäya sädhünäà vinäçäya ca
duñkåtäm. The sädhus, the devotees of the Lord, are always eager to advance
the cause of Kåñëa consciousness so that the conditioned souls may be released
from the bondage of birth and death. But the asuras, the demons, impede the
advancement of the Kåñëa consciousness movement, and therefore Kåñëa
arranges occasional fights between different asuras who are very much
interested in increasing their military power. The duty of the government or
king is not to increase military power unnecessarily; the real duty of the
government is to see that the people of the state advance in Kåñëa
consciousness. For this purpose, Kåñëa says in Bhagavad-gétä (4.13),
cätur-varëyaà mayä såñöaà guëa-karma-vibhägaçaù: "According to the three
modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of
human society were created by Me." There should be an ideal class of men who
are bona fide brähmaëas, and they should be given all protection. Namo
brahmaëya-deväya go-brähmaëa-hitäya ca. Kåñëa is very fond of brähmaëas and
cows, The brähmaëas promulgate the cause of advancement in Kåñëa
consciousness, and the cows give enough milk to maintain the body in the
mode of goodness. The kñatriyas and the government should be advised by the
brähmaëas. Next, the vaiçyas should produce enough foodstuffs, and the
çüdras, who cannot do anything beneficial on their own, should serve the
three higher classes (the brähmaëas, kñatriyas and vaiçyas). This is the
arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead so that the conditioned
souls will be released from the material condition and return home, back to
Godhead. This is the purpose of Kåñëa's descent on the surface of the earth
(pariträëäya sädhünäà vinäçäya ca duñkåtäm).
Everyone must understand Kåñëa's activities (janma karma ca me divyam
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
939
[Bg. 4.9]). If one understands the purpose of Kåñëa's coming to this earth and
performing His activities, one is immediately liberated. This liberation is the
purpose of the creation and Kåñëa's descent upon the surface of the earth.
Demons are very much interested in advancing a plan by which people will
labor hard like cats, dogs and hogs, but Kåñëa's devotees want to teach Kåñëa
consciousness so that people will be satisfied with plain living and Kåñëa
conscious advancement. Although demons have created many plans for
industry and hard labor so that people will work day and night like animals,
this is not the purpose of civilization. Such endeavors are jagato'hitaù; that is,
they are meant for the misfortune of the people in general. Kñayäya: such
activities lead to annihilation. One who understands the purpose of Kåñëa, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, should seriously understand the importance
of the Kåñëa consciousness movement and seriously take part in it. One should
not endeavor for ugra-karma, or unnecessary work for sense gratification.
Nünaà pramattaù kurute vikarma yad indriya-prétaya äpåëoti (SB 5.5.4). Simply
for sense gratification, people make plans for material happiness.
Mäyä-sukhäya bharam udvahato vimüòhän (SB 7.9.43). They do this because
they are all vimüòhas, rascals. For flickering happiness, people waste their
human energy, not understanding the importance of the Kåñëa consciousness
movement but instead accusing the simple devotees of brainwashing. Demons
may falsely accuse the preachers of the Kåñëa consciousness movement, but
Kåñëa will arrange a fight between the demons in which all their military
power will be engaged and both parties of demons will be annihilated.

TRANSLATION
To show causeless mercy to the devotees who would take birth in the future
in this age of Kali, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, acted in such a
way that simply by remembering Him one will be freed from all the lamentation
and unhappiness of material existence. [In other words, He acted so that all
future devotees, by accepting the instructions of Kåñëa consciousness stated in
Bhagavad-gétä, could be relieved from the pangs of material existence.]
PURPORT
The Lord's activities of saving the devotees and killing the demons
(pariträëäya sädhünäà vinäçäya ca duñkåtäm [Bg. 4.8]) take place side by side.
Kåñëa actually appears for the deliverance of the sädhus, or bhaktas, but by
killing the demons He shows them mercy also, for anyone killed by Kåñëa is
liberated. Whether the Lord kills or gives protection, He is kind to both the
demons and the devotees.

transcendental, purified ears; yaçaù-tértha-vare—keeping oneself in the best of

message; upaspåçya—touching (exactly like the water of the Ganges);

TRANSLATION
Simply by receiving the glories of the Lord through purified transcendental
ears, the devotees of the Lord are immediately freed from strong material
desires and engagement in fruitive activities.
PURPORT
When the devotees aurally receive the activities of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead as enacted in Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam, they
immediately achieve a transcendental vision in which they are no longer
interested in materialistic activities. Thus they achieve freedom from the
material world. For sense gratification practically everyone is engaged in
materialistic activities, which prolong the process of janma-måtyu jarä-vyädhi
[Bg. 13.9]—birth, death, old age and disease—but the devotee, simply by
hearing the message of Bhagavad-gétä and further relishing the narrations of
Çrémad-Bhägavatam, becomes so pure that he no longer takes interest in
materialistic activities. At the moment, devotees in the Western countries are
being attracted by Kåñëa consciousness and becoming uninterested in
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
943
materialistic activities, and therefore people are trying to oppose this
movement. But they cannot possibly check this movement or stop the
activities of the devotees in Europe and America by their artificial impositions.
Here the words çroträïjalir upaspåçya indicate that simply by hearing the
transcendental activities of the Lord the devotees become so pure that they are
immediately immune to the contamination of materialistic fruitive activities.
Anyäbhiläñitä-çünyam [Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 1.1.11(5)] Materialistic activities
are unnecessary for the soul, and therefore the devotees are freed from such
activities. The devotees are situated in liberation (brahma-bhüyäya kalpate [Bg.
14.26]), and therefore they cannot be called back to their material homes and
materialistic activities.

TRANSLATION
Assisted by the descendants of Bhoja, Våñëi, Andhaka, Madhu, Çürasena,
Daçärha, Kuru, Såïjaya and Päëòu, Lord Kåñëa performed various activities.
By His pleasing smiles, His affectionate behavior, His instructions and His
uncommon pastimes like raising Govardhana Hill, the Lord, appearing in His
transcendental body, pleased all of human society.
PURPORT
The words nålokaà ramayäm äsa mürtyä sarväìga-ramyayä are significant.
Kåñëa is the original form. Bhagavän, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is
therefore described here by the word mürtyä. The word mürti means "form."
Kåñëa, or God, is never impersonal; the impersonal feature is but a
manifestation of His transcendental body (yasya prabhä prabhavato
jagad-aëòa-koöi [Bs. 5.40]). The Lord is naräkåti, exactly resembling the form of
a human being, but His form is different from ours. Therefore the word
sarväìga-ramyayä informs us that every part of His body is pleasing for
everyone to see. Apart from His smiling face, every part of His body—His
hands, His legs, His chest—is pleasing to the devotees, who cannot at any time
stop seeing the beautiful form of the Lord.

sharks. His ears are beautiful, His cheeks brilliant, and His smiling attractive to
everyone. Whoever sees Lord Kåñëa sees a festival. His face and body are fully
satisfying for everyone to see, but the devotees are angry at the creator for the

946
disturbance caused by the momentary blinking of their eyes.
PURPORT
As stated by the Lord Himself in the Bhagavad-gétä (7.3):
manuñyäëäà sahasreñu
kaçcid yatati siddhaye
yatatäm api siddhänäà
kaçcin mäà vetti tattvataù
"Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of
those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth." Unless
one is qualified to understand Kåñëa, one cannot appreciate the presence of
Kåñëa on earth. Among the Bhojas, Våñëis, Andhakas, Päëòavas and many
other kings intimately related with Kåñëa, the intimate relationship between
Kåñëa and the inhabitants of Våndävana is especially to be noted. That
relationship is described in this verse by the words nityotsavaà na tatåpur
dåçibhiù pibantyaù. The inhabitants of Våndävana especially, such as the
cowherd boys, the cows, the calves, the gopés and Kåñëa's father and mother,
were never fully satisfied, although they saw Kåñëa's beautiful features
constantly. Seeing Kåñëa is described here as nitya-utsava, a daily festival. The
inhabitants of Våndävana saw Kåñëa almost every moment, but when Kåñëa
left the village for the pasturing grounds, where He tended the cows and
calves, the gopés were very much afflicted because they saw Kåñëa walking on
the sand and thought that Kåñëa's lotus feet, which they dared not place on
their breasts because they thought their breasts not soft enough, were being
pierced by broken chips of stone. By even thinking of this, the gopés were
affected, and they cried at home. These gopés, who were therefore the exalted
friends of Kåñëa, saw Kåñëa constantly, but because their eyelids disturbed
their vision of Kåñëa, the gopés condemned the creator, Lord Brahmä.
Therefore the beauty of Kåñëa, especially the beauty of His face, is described
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
947
here. At the end of the Ninth Canto, in the Twenty-fourth Chapter, we find a
hint of Kåñëa's beauty. Now we are proceeding to the Tenth Canto, which is
considered Kåñëa's head. The entire Çrémad-Bhägavata Puräëa is the
embodiment of Kåñëa's form, and the Tenth Canto is His face. This verse gives
a hint of how beautiful His face is. Kåñëa's smiling face, with His cheeks, His
lips, the ornaments in His ears, His chewing of betel nuts—all this was
minutely observed by the gopés, who thus enjoyed transcendental bliss, so
much so that they were never fully satisfied to see Kåñëa's face, but instead
condemned the creator of the body for making eyelids that obstructed their
vision. The beauty of Kåñëa's face was therefore much more appreciated by the
gopés than by His friends the cowherd boys or even by Yaçodä Mätä, who was
also interested in decorating the face of Kåñëa.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, known as lélä-puruñottama,
appeared as the son of Vasudeva but immediately left His father's home and
went to Våndävana to expand His loving relationship with His confidential
devotees. In Våndävana the Lord killed many demons, and afterwards He
returned to Dvärakä, where according to Vedic principles He married many
wives who were the best of women, begot through them hundreds of sons, and
performed sacrifices for His own worship to establish the principles of
householder life.
PURPORT
As stated in Bhagavad-gétä (15.15), vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù: by all
the Vedas, it is Kåñëa who is to be known. Lord Çré Kåñëa, setting an example
by His own behavior, performed many ritualistic ceremonies described in the
Vedas and established the principles of gåhastha life by marrying many wives
and begetting many children just to show people in general how to be happy by
living according to Vedic principles. The center of Vedic sacrifice is Kåñëa
(vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù). To advance in human life, human society
must follow the Vedic principles personally demonstrated by Lord Kåñëa in His
householder life. The real purpose of Kåñëa's appearance, however, was to
manifest how one can take part in loving affairs with the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. Reciprocations of loving affairs in ecstasy are possible only in
copyright ©1998 Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, all rights reserved – www.krishna.com
949
Våndävana. Therefore just after His appearance as the son of Vasudeva, the
Lord immediately left for Våndävana. In Våndävana, the Lord not only took
part in loving affairs with His father and mother, the gopés and the cowherd
boys, but also gave liberation to many demons by killing them. As stated in
Bhagavad-gétä (4.8), pariträëäya sädhünäà vinäçäya ca duñkåtäm: the Lord
appears in order to protect the devotees and kill the demons. This was fully
exhibited by His personal behavior. In Bhagavad-gétä the Lord is understood by
Arjuna to be puruñaà çäçvataà divyam—the eternal, transcendental Supreme
Person. Here also we find the words utpädya teñu puruñaù. Therefore it is to be
concluded that the Absolute Truth is puruña, a person. The impersonal feature
is but one of the features of His personality. Ultimately, He is a person; He is
not impersonal. And not only is He puruña, a person, but He is the
lélä-puruñottama, the best of all persons.

TRANSLATION
Thereafter, Lord Çré Kåñëa created a misunderstanding between family
members just to diminish the burden of the world. Simply by His glance, He
annihilated all the demoniac kings on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra and declared
victory for Arjuna. Finally, He instructed Uddhava about transcendental life
and devotion and then returned to His abode in His original form.
PURPORT
Pariträëäya sädhünäà vinäçäya ca duñkåtäm [Bg. 4.8]. The mission of Lord
Kåñëa was performed on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra, for by the Lord's mercy
Arjuna was victorious due to being a great devotee whereas the others were
killed simply by the Lord's glance, which cleansed them of all sinful activities
and enabled them to attain särüpya. Finally, Lord Kåñëa instructed Uddhava
about the transcendental life of devotional service, and then, in due course of
time, He returned to His abode. The Lord's instructions in the form of
Bhagavad-gétä are full of jïäna and vairägya, knowledge and renunciation. In
the human form of life, one must learn these two things—how to become
detached from the material world and how to acquire full knowledge in
spiritual life. This is the Lord's mission (pariträëäya sädhünäà vinäçäya ca
duñkåtäm). After executing His complete mission, the Lord returned to His
home, Goloka Våndävana.
